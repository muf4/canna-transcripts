[SPEAKER_01]: my my special guests that I have sometimes
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if a special guest pops up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Let's talk let's talk about Let's talk
about new seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's got to be one person in
here who's thinking about starting a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company Where would you guys like me to
start like what questions do you have when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to that or you just want me to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want me to start firing off different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wrote an article earlier and I
was gonna put it up on the I Was gonna put
[SPEAKER_01]: it up on The right seats forum,
however, I think strain Lee might put it
[SPEAKER_01]: up, but we'll see we'll see III want I
want to see strain Lee do well because
[SPEAKER_01]: they are very very nice guys very nice
guys It's not like a big corporation doing
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, you know These are guys doing this
in their spare time just because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to do You know,
they want to have something good going No,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I mean Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I do when I s1 and rename your
seeds change your name to dirty water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm Where should someone start with their
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's a kind of a weird
question I mean, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer that one As far as start with
genetics get good genetics in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place do your research Know who's making
what know who actually has what clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of things are just claims
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are just claims Actually,
you know You could technically just buy
[SPEAKER_01]: one of all of one of my line and just
rename the whole motherfucker You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, let me find this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote That I just want to be able to
reference this Okay Rule number one I have
[SPEAKER_01]: here pull up a chair and shut your fucking
mouth Man, I you know, I might have taken
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that advice early on because I was
a fucking loudmouth asshole know it all
[SPEAKER_01]: and I definitely did not know everything
early on you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: so But but like when someone when someone
comes to talk and I'm not even talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking about In general if
you're on a live feed and someone pops up
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's an old breeder Shut your fucking
mouth man, unless you have a good question
[SPEAKER_01]: shut your fucking mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look dumb Don't don't look dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're starting your career,
a lot of people remember everything they
[SPEAKER_01]: see, you know, and don't remember Hey,
that was that dude that was asking how to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking clone out of his asshole,
you know, like don't don't Don't be dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say dumb shit Any genetic profiling
to protect your intellectual property?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually I'm working with the open
Canada This project on IP protection IP
[SPEAKER_01]: protection and They're doing some fucking
awesome things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have good lawyers on this Yeah,
but let me get back to this real quick
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just shut your mouth, you know when
an old-school breeder comes up That that's
[SPEAKER_01]: your chance man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your chance to like get that get
that power up like on Super Mario Brothers
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's your chance to absorb it
like a sponge take that take that Chance
[SPEAKER_01]: man, listen to what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of guys who have a lot of
amazing shit to say Let's see what we got
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding number two Number two I did tell
you not to use protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry Breeding is a fucking science.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an actual science to this There
are fucking terms that have actual
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions Don't be one of those people
who uses the term IBL and not know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking IBL is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No f1s no f2s no back crosses know that in
crosses are a thing but know the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate time to use them This is there
there's a science to this and believe it
[SPEAKER_01]: or not There are other things besides weed
that people grow that they've been growing
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time that also have Breeding
terms associated with it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have somewhat borrowed
and We have changed some of the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: terms because some of those don't apply to
cannabis but but definitely understand all
[SPEAKER_01]: those inside out if you need if you want a
good place to start don't start with the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking forum don't start with reading
what some other fucking breeder like Mel
[SPEAKER_01]: van says or or Whoever, you know,
I mean most of these people are using IBL
[SPEAKER_01]: in their lines and it's not CSI Humboldt
It's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not professor P Chances are they
don't know what a fucking IBL is
[SPEAKER_01]: guaranteed Don't slap that on the end of
your fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new breeder, you don't know
what it means Learn how to write and I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually did this earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh The book list Robert Connell Clark
marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you ever need to know as far as
books You really don't need more than that
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ shorts book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't read the title It's good for
learning about specific Mexican lines But
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean other than that when it comes to
straight breeding, you don't need more
[SPEAKER_01]: than Robert Robert Connell Clark's
Marijuana botany Learn how to write
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genetic nomenclature Female x
male Female x female parentheses reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: They use your brackets brackets are your
friends parentheses are your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason that those are there
people don't just throw those in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it look pretty and more established
use them correctly It makes you look more
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent and it genuinely gets your
respect from your peers better.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Breeding has a purpose part
three breeding has a fucking purpose if
[SPEAKER_01]: you are Crossing two things just to see
what happens and you don't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's gonna happen because you've never
grown those lines before That's not
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that seed making now with that
said it's possible to be a seed maker in a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and in fact, it's advisable to do
Both because people need that new shiny
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking thing and it's hard to stay
relevant in the cannabis community If you
[SPEAKER_01]: are not doing both and that's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it really is if you're not
constantly pushing out new lines It's hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So push out new lines Do your thing but
work some lines in the background get to
[SPEAKER_01]: know get to know what it's like to watch
plants evolve Let's see what else we got
[SPEAKER_01]: here But yeah, how breed with the purpose
say this is my end goal I want something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is I want it short With fucking dense
structure, but I don't want to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: PM and Maybe some purple would be nice
then look in your toolbox see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to create that make that shit happen
sometimes it'll take several generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but When you do that, you'll have some
true breeding lines in the end And that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the most valuable thing you can
have in your toolkit as far as a breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: goes Let's see what else we got Now we're
at permissions It's probably the question
[SPEAKER_01]: I get asked about the most permissions The
number one determiner in all this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you pay for the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's something you need to take
into account when thinking about all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff Short stout and stinky fucking
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I'm like pig pen I have a little
cloud When I walk around If you paid for
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds Different rules apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you are a tester You definitely
need to ask need to ask permission from
[SPEAKER_01]: that breeder And it needs to be clear
before you use those seeds if you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: pay for those or gift or whatever ask
permission If you paid for them
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, you should be able to do
what you want except for direct copying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not okay in any industry Why should
it be okay in this industry breeding is an
[SPEAKER_01]: art and if someone is Taking your art
Changing the name on it like wiping off
[SPEAKER_01]: your name writing their name on it and
signing it with a new name It that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fucked right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucked that doesn't fly anywhere So
but if you're making it f1 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say and you're using two different
readers work If you paid for those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really don't necessarily have to ask
them for their work But you should you
[SPEAKER_01]: should it's proper it's polite you'll get
more respect from those people Whose work
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using you'll definitely get more
respect and name check those motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_01]: later, you know Shout out some props to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way it's done, man That's
that's the way you get respect from
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone your elders and everyone that
came before you You got to pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay your dues However,
if you ask and they say no and you bought
[SPEAKER_01]: those motherfuckers and you're not doing a
direct copy It's up to you it depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: how much heat you want some some breeders
get more upset about that than others,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the make-your-own-mail thing
that's that's nice and dandy but again not
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an obligation to do that You're
still trying to get Bodie's permission
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Bodie cares so much man He's
he's one of the most open breeders there
[SPEAKER_01]: are as far as people working with this
stuff When I say direct copy I mean s1 or
[SPEAKER_01]: f-gen Let's see When is it okay to f-gen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you if you don't understand what
f-gen is refer back to rule 2 and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: book Robert Connell Clark Robert Connell
Clark marijuana botany that'll help you
[SPEAKER_01]: learn those terms When is it okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: To f-gen if a company is no longer around
If a company is no longer around and they
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no foreseeable future for them
coming back around It usually is okay
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when a line is really hard to
find and there's a lot of people that want
[SPEAKER_01]: it in their collection And there's a
chance a line could be lost then it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really advisable to do that We don't
want to start losing lines because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: so many have been lost already because of
stuff like that In the case of let's let's
[SPEAKER_01]: let's choose the brothers grin grim
situation They left There was no
[SPEAKER_01]: foreseeable future of them coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people made c99 F gens,
you know Apollo 11 F gens Apollo 13 that
[SPEAKER_01]: made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those lines were hard to get even
back then they were expensive and And a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people did what they could to save
those lines If it's from key playing you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use it shoot yourself because you
shouldn't be Using fucking bullshit from
[SPEAKER_01]: that idiot But that's when it's okay to
f-gen without permission some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys aren't even around to ask permission
for or in the case of a clone only Where
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder is not determined you can in
you need to do your due diligence to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the breeders not Determined but
there's some pretty obvious candidates out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that nobody knows who bred it bag
seed, etc Real five respect man respect
[SPEAKER_01]: and and Don't give respect where they
haven't earned it because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfuckers that haven't earned respect
that have been around a while Doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: they have have respect a lot of these guys
have respect Respect from customers and
[SPEAKER_01]: not even to their own customers Respect
from people buying seeds because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: on the attitude or whatever seed bank and
they're getting hype But they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the respect to their peers what you want
your ultimate goal If you really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a breeder is the respect of your
fucking peers Do you have the respect of
[SPEAKER_01]: your peers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the people that you interact with do
the people that you respect respect you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's major man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's major Number six this is probably
one of the most important and I should
[SPEAKER_01]: have probably listed as number one Come
with thick fucking skin You're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make it if you get your feelings hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you what it's really really
hard to make it in this industry It's even
[SPEAKER_01]: more cutthroat than it used to be People
say shit about you and if they have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking people listening to them those
people will say shit about you They'll
[SPEAKER_01]: post it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these guys have all the time on
their hand to do this shit man,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know lots of retirees or disabled
people or or not necessarily disabled
[SPEAKER_01]: people but people on workman's comp or
whatever they have time to do this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: and They will fucking try to crush you
People don't like competition people do
[SPEAKER_01]: not like competition And they will try to
ruin you so get some thick fucking skin
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I when I came to this I thought I
had thick fucking skin But there was there
[SPEAKER_01]: was years where I was fucking Completely
doubting everything that I did and I
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't have ever let anybody had that
effect on me But it's hard man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get trolled Once you start
getting the following and you get trolled
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it as a compliment for reals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it as a compliment That means you're
doing something that's that's stirring
[SPEAKER_01]: people's emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean if you're being a fuckhead you're
getting trolled That's a different thing
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part if you're if you're
doing some good shit for people and people
[SPEAKER_01]: are liking it and you're still getting
trolled Take it as a compliment a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys that do troll people just want
you to recognize them They just want your
[SPEAKER_01]: attention be it negative or positive Kind
of like little retarded kids like how they
[SPEAKER_01]: just they'll like slap you to get your
attention You know kind of like that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I got for the the the rules in
general is there anything anybody has any
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about My people won't put my
paper I Mean Jaws did a great job of
[SPEAKER_01]: making himself, you know popular off
trolling me and that was only because I
[SPEAKER_01]: responded to his shit So there's a time
and place to respond and sometimes I suck
[SPEAKER_01]: it at just not I sometimes I do respond
too much and I've been trying to weigh
[SPEAKER_01]: that reaction better
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with cookie main I haven't
figured that out man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't figured that out What are the
unwritten rules now Give Matt everything
[SPEAKER_01]: for free Be it lights be it nutrients just
give me shit, you know, just give me free
[SPEAKER_01]: shit I like free shit What's up Jax What's
the best way to collect money for seeds I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't go into detail on that since that's
an illegality, you know, and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to set myself up but There's ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend PayPal PayPal is fucking
terrible and they like to steal your money
[SPEAKER_01]: on a moral clause So I don't recommend
that Do reversals cause more harms?
[SPEAKER_01]: No only if an idiot's doing a reversal and
they haven't properly assessed their lines
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your question Jax I saw something
pop up but I every time I pop from here to
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else like it turns off my screen
so I couldn't answer I saw something about
[SPEAKER_01]: God's gift and something else
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you consider strains built off
Hype not good breeding and no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there there are strains that
absolutely deserve the hype You know and
[SPEAKER_01]: that are good breeding but there's plenty
that aren't Yeah, send out tons of free
[SPEAKER_01]: gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get people like you Alright
guys, let's help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's help my friend Jacqueline decide
fire og or lemon meringue or God's gift
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say no on the God's gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't know much about lemon meringue
other people Well, I take that back that's
[SPEAKER_01]: right you never smoke what you want to try
go for something light Go for God's gift
[SPEAKER_01]: go for something light and when I say take
a little tiny Hit at a time wait ten
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take another little tiny hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm being serious It's not like when we
were young and smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing like it It's called micro
dosing and and it works great with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis when you don't have a tolerance
so go for something light Yeah fire og
[SPEAKER_01]: will fuck her up and we'll fuck her day up
if it's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so yeah, definitely go for something
light Okay, I'll be around I got uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, let me know how it goes Do you think
if someone finds a cut in someone else's
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or bag seed then passes it around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the person that found it
should say what is done with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that someone finds a cut in
someone else's seeds or bags he passes
[SPEAKER_01]: around Do you think the person that found
it should say what is done with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I Mean I think I think both people
should have a say but that doesn't always
[SPEAKER_01]: happen Exactly, man, I remember when I
quit smoking for two years I was dating a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking retard and she didn't want me
smoking despite what I do for a living so
[SPEAKER_01]: I played in and I'm not referring about to
brain in any way by the way brings great
[SPEAKER_01]: but Yeah, man The first time smoking
again, it's just like that first high and
[SPEAKER_01]: some shits too much man Have you curled up
in the corner and a little ball crying?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no fun And that's no fun at all
Have you ever made something so dank you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to release it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um I want people to have good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have the best weed out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll release it there were times where I
wouldn't release cuts of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would release weed of it and
Clockwork being the main one with that and
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just because I didn't want us to
get ripped off But eventually that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, if it's good enough if your weed
is good enough it will get ripped off and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's part of the process but The thing I
just tell myself is these guys are still
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be working with my tailings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always a few years behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever mmm God's gift starting God's
gift was at GDP and OG I think GDP OG
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't that God's gift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most God's gift cuts like the Sonoma God's
gift cut out there that's the original was
[SPEAKER_01]: a Sonoma God's gift and it was kind of
leafy and Very long long narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't very frosty not very great But
for its time it was okay
[SPEAKER_01]: Best strain for consistent piney turps
Don't know I'm not big on the pines How do
[SPEAKER_01]: I get some seeds to you if you would ever
like something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get a PO box I really do but I
just DM me man DM me What if you make a
[SPEAKER_01]: known strain with different sourced
parents, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you recreate a strain with different
parents like let's say it's fire OG cross
[SPEAKER_01]: to Abusive OG, let's say and you use those
same two cuts to make the line That's
[SPEAKER_01]: yours, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do whatever the fuck you want with it
There's different ways to paint the same
[SPEAKER_01]: picture You know what I mean and not and
once those strains are acclimated to your
[SPEAKER_01]: room What you make is gonna be different
than what is presented especially when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to selection You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you do a selection from that
Specific cross it'll be different than the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection that's available as a clone only
There you go snow cap for pine turps,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about snow cap Did you
like that I rock you just mad cuz your
[SPEAKER_01]: face is longer than the fucking donkeys
Bodhi is one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend everything that he does the
guy is a fucking magician.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the wizard of weed So you're in good
hands with anything from the guy man Just
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the description see if it appeals
to you and try it and and and if it works
[SPEAKER_01]: for you That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not move to the next that's what
growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we adapt Is p91 classed as a skunk p91
it would be class more as an Afghani tie
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid Williams wonder cross to I think
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was it was silverback tie cross
to I Always forget the other part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to look
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found any skunky ones in the
green suicide absolutely in all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: and anything I use the the roadkill
Afghani Male with you're gonna find some
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky phenotypes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very very heavy with skunky
phenotypes Bodhi is an amazing dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that about a lot of people but
I can absolutely say that about him he is
[SPEAKER_01]: he's When my company almost crashed when I
got a really fucked up disease from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines a plant disease Bodhi made
sure that my my business did not crash and
[SPEAKER_01]: I could never say anything bad about the
guy because of that and Not only because
[SPEAKER_01]: that he is at his base a good person
What's my favorite strain I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite strains it just depends on the
time the day my mood etc
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi is one of my favorite human beings
not just breeder But one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings on this earth what to expect
from platinum alien orange cookies Did you
[SPEAKER_01]: are you familiar with the the the orange
cookies from obsolete?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a I'm a grower not a shower definitely
not a shower grower Alien
[SPEAKER_01]: orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: the the orange cookies There's a an
astringent phenotype in the line that is
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy frosty really dense and it's it's
the one phenotype I found that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking herm tell Lupita Come on right now
while we still have some time tell old man
[SPEAKER_01]: to get on I'd love to have him on any
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the loops bring them on But it has
like an astringent like almost it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: even really that orange the phenotype that
I picked it's very astringent Very fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: frosty very dense and it breathes very
well That mixed with my platinum banana
[SPEAKER_01]: mill that passes over banana turps like
artificial banana turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find everything in there and in
between If I could recommend one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: strains to pop a pack what would it be it
depends on the person's grower Level
[SPEAKER_01]: orange cookies was full of fucking herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time to find a single cut
They didn't pass on herm traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking really hard to find It made
it worth it To spend money on all those
[SPEAKER_01]: packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, yeah Pretty much anything with
Calio has some issues At skunk number one
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with the female p91 with time male
is is it skunky all maybe just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see 1980 skin that crossed with the
femme of p91 with time male I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: confused on what you're asking Um,
you know psychedelic effect really depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on your own brain chemistry what might be
psychedelic for me and trippy for me may
[SPEAKER_01]: not Have that effect for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to say There are
certain lines that are known to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: effect for a majority of people be it
Malawi Different Malawi is different
[SPEAKER_01]: Africans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah Alien technology is in the alien
orange cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I'm pretty sure aliens orange
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember but yeah It's good shit
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That orange cookies cut is amazing But I
don't recommend running the seeds because
[SPEAKER_01]: you will have a long hunt in front of you
What made me keep popping packs when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get herms I understand cannabis science
and and and how plants work everything
[SPEAKER_01]: needs some acclimation to an extent There
are some lines that her more than others
[SPEAKER_01]: and that just means the lines are Not as
happy in their current environment as
[SPEAKER_01]: other lines would be some lines adapt
better Knowing that full well If you find
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 1 in 30 that aren't a herm It still
usually passes on her traits when you
[SPEAKER_01]: breed with it That's why you have to run
the progeny yourself to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: that that trait didn't pass on Yes,
did an original alien cookie strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: correct I didn't release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let some out to a few different people
The strongest RKS turps would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom Afghani s ones that to me had the
strongest The skunk spray chem was really
[SPEAKER_01]: loved for its Skunk spray turps as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Was never really into peyote purple for
crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already had bubbles that I was working
with
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, I mean The herm issue just
drives me nuts I see people complaining
[SPEAKER_01]: about herms and what that tells to me
first when you see someone say man I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: like ten packs and everything's a fucking
herm that says more about the person
[SPEAKER_01]: growing than it does the Whoever seeds he
ran An experienced grower gets that should
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to hear that and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, you got a fucking problem,
dude That's not that common to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: many fucking herms But even then man like
if you're a grower you're supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to adapt this shit That's what good
growers do you see a herm you catch that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit early because you pay attention to
your plants pay attention your fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plants Don't fucking bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a part of growing cannabis is an
intersex plant by nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just handle your shit handle your
business makes you look like a bitch when
[SPEAKER_01]: you cry So yeah, but I mean if you if you
spent thousands on a line and you have not
[SPEAKER_01]: found anything that won't herm And you're
not the only person having this problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's a problem and it needs to be
addressed Exactly, you know, I mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how it goes But nine out of ten
times it's gonna be because it's not happy
[SPEAKER_01]: in your room Let it acclimate take a clone
from a clone from a clone If that line is
[SPEAKER_01]: good enough to put that much time into and
you really see some potential In it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still has herms clone from a clone
from a clone acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably not happen again nine times
out of ten it won't happen again Limelight
[SPEAKER_01]: is not is not a massive yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the jackhares that has a
Smaller yield compared to typical
[SPEAKER_01]: jackhares But the resin production makes
up for its yield tenfold especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an extract artist and the lime the
lime skunk is Is insane the lime skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: combo is insane I loved it
[SPEAKER_01]: Same questions different feed Yep What's
your thought on breeders or even new
[SPEAKER_01]: school breeders making profits off s1s
from kick-ass clones like lemon tree TK to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring a chem dog other than getting beat
up There's a there's a time and place for
[SPEAKER_01]: s1s You know, I can't I can't really call
people out for that because I mean early
[SPEAKER_01]: on in my career, that's what I do I I
would I would reverse plants and cross
[SPEAKER_01]: them to popular clone on the hybrids back
then Clones didn't get sent around the
[SPEAKER_01]: country as often things were a lot more
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time there was a high demand
for it Apparently now there's still a high
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Just wish like when people s1 lemon
tree, they'd call it what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking lemon diesel, you know Well,
you know get the names right at least
[SPEAKER_01]: Topanga Canyon, I don't even know who's
responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see a problem with s wanting
that Chem 91 that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different story We know who is
responsible for that one the fact that he
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't kicked down Anything be it seeds or
anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shame, you know, so when I see
chem 91 s ones I kind of that that does
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of irk me Yeah Would you say poly
hybridization is a reason for more harms
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would say it's from bad growers
feeding their plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes But yeah, I mean when it comes to
when it comes to people in reverse hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: I Especially if it's a hybrid I I think
it's awesome, especially if they know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing and they're good at it You
know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if they're doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, I I don't do a lot of reverse
lines anymore I sell the spray but I tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to stick with regulars just because it's
just what I like doing It costs a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: money to make reverse to do to do
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs a lot more money less pollen
People don't realize how much more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: process it is Love you stray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got to send you your fucking dab
tools Still have them here for you Yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: have my press but I haven't put it up
because of the landlord walk through shit
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I haven't done I haven't put
anything up or used it because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a fucking hectic week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been crazy trying to get all
this shit done
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do people get so much shit for making
s1s that's a good question and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's I Think it's just misinformation for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was saying oh it's one term
Feminize C term they hurt a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time what people were seeing and they were
calling herms from reversals were males
[SPEAKER_01]: true males in a line What's up mean gene I
Want to bring mean gene on the show too
[SPEAKER_01]: what I want I want to have you on the show
so many people I want to have on What's
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between your heirloom
Afghani and a roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had a roadkill Afghani and that
was my heirloom Afghani cross to sour dub
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also did a version where it was the
male Afghani that passed on the skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: trait cross to sour dub is the female but
The main difference is one has the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: dub in it and the other doesn't Sour dub
did great at passing on skunk turps It
[SPEAKER_01]: already has kind of a skunky turp To it
when I grow it anyways, it's very skunky
[SPEAKER_01]: but not super super skunky But because of
that little bit of skunk it it really
[SPEAKER_01]: really absorbs the skunk when crossed and
that and that's cool to see Very
[SPEAKER_01]: underrated line very underrated cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Man I wanted to be at the San
Bernardino Cup at this weekend my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: bikes gonna be there But I don't know if
I'm to be able to make it because of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the landlord shit going on It's fucking me
in the ass Not too stoked about it Meme
[SPEAKER_01]: gene meme gene that guy slays it with the
memes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever used an s1 male in a
breeding project?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the clockwork PIF And it was it
was phenomenal had a higher female to male
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio which is you know, kind of cool,
but That was the only time I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an experiment and it turned out to
be good But I don't like using s1 males
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever hit the aphi with the reverse
cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got around to it man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of trouble with the aphi Still
having some trouble with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just lost the mom I have one single cut
of it left trying to root right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do my best to get it to Mooney
to do some tissue culture with or Who
[SPEAKER_01]: else?
[SPEAKER_01]: DSG labs one of those guys I'm giving them
to tissue culture it just so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important line, but it's not very
vigorous the seeds were Super fucking old
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slow, but god damn it has amazing
turps How are my max looking they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: young man I've kept him in small pots just
because I was trying to finish this last
[SPEAKER_01]: run and right now I I don't know what the
future is for The immediate future is
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway for that What is dumpster It's
usually a big box outside of a like a
[SPEAKER_01]: convenience store, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon is the boss Mooney is the boss That
guy is a tissue culture fucking genius Do
[SPEAKER_01]: the strawberry switch made like to be
bushed out or left alone?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on where you're growing it and
how you're growing it It grows completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different outdoors than it does indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turps also change Do you ever cut off
male shoots with pollen sacks about to
[SPEAKER_01]: open and isolate them to collect the
pollen better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that that that can definitely be a
method for collecting pollen Like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know cut off a big branch stick it in
some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a water cup So it's easier to
collect the pollen as opposed to trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: move a tree around, you know Yeah,
that's that's a definite good option for
[SPEAKER_01]: it I Remember the story about dumpster
something about someone saw a Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that like had been tossed or a
seedling or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been tossed right by a dumpster So
they picked it up kept it and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember hearing I don't know how
accurate That is but that was the Canna
[SPEAKER_01]: Bible story if I remember correctly Anyone
got the real purple Kush or great vape
[SPEAKER_01]: from comp Chi I Have the SR 71 for Kush,
which is pretty so close to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous And was the other one
great vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have great vape anymore Bodhi ran
that a lot and I used to run it I made
[SPEAKER_01]: great vape s ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a great vape sour bubble crock Back
in the day, but I don't keep the great
[SPEAKER_01]: vape anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar again to Urkel with
slightly more narrow leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor with LED on the switchblade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really couldn't tell you I've never
grown under LEDs at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how she'll react She's a
very the switch blade is very lanky very
[SPEAKER_01]: lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind Very lanky it
stretches a lot in flower Those underdog
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkels are some of the most dank shit on
earth I got a taste
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the deal with reversing the
uptown pif to make s ones wasn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions on that The only restriction
that I had was that I couldn't release it
[SPEAKER_01]: pure I didn't reverse any Pifs I had the
h1 the h2 h1 being the Frankie type h2
[SPEAKER_01]: being the mango pif But I was never
allowed to release a pure that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing I was never allowed to fucking
do and I kind of wish I would have Just
[SPEAKER_01]: done it just to have to do a CD increase
so I didn't ever lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I I don't know man But I just
didn't want to piss off a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: Dominicans that's not that's not the way
to go is have a bunch of Dominican
[SPEAKER_01]: gangsters pissed at you Loud watermelon
turps af gooey is the first thing I think
[SPEAKER_01]: of when I think of like melon like a blue
melon type Growing I've seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: watermelon skittles that didn't have the
watermelon Turps it was more sweet after
[SPEAKER_01]: we definitely had melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the watermelon hash plant from
Bodhi?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that had some watermelon
phenotypes as well very hard to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, but definitely had the watermelon
turps
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what like I figure if I keep
doing these eventually more sales will
[SPEAKER_01]: come So I guess that's a way of getting
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun though, man I like I like
interacting with everyone and it makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: happy when my friends come in,
you know, like We can just shoot the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is what I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do it all day Sour bubble as in
gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never heard of gorilla bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about sour bubble as in sour
bubble It's a bubble gum bubble gum line
[SPEAKER_01]: from bog Twitch gets you paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to look into that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think I'm the last the furthest thing
for a cannabis therapist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too chaotic people don't need that
shit
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can ask about springtails it
does anybody here know anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: springtails I I know absolutely nothing
about springtails, but does anybody here
[SPEAKER_01]: have any experience with springtails?
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend here bearded Is having a little
issue with springtails and he wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: know What's the deal with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are they beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they all beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a chance it could cause root
problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't know who's gonna be at San
Francisco San Bernardino and I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: selling Seeds is gonna be an issue in San
Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it was even a few months ago
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, go to go to CSI Humboldt for the
underdog miracle definitely Was you just
[SPEAKER_01]: giving multiple micro supplements like
mammoth and so yeah, yeah, definitely feed
[SPEAKER_01]: feed your autos Just like you would a
normal plant when it starts to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust and cut nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh There you go, there you go bearded
Message crybaby organics about the
[SPEAKER_01]: springtails.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking An amazing brain for this
business an amazing brain What's the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking deal with sell and seeds what's
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a problem selling seeds it
shows now especially in California because
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that the California med
board is gonna be going around Checking
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's licenses to sell said seeds if
you're selling without a license and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna have a fucking problem You're
gonna be on a big radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: Best place to pick up CSI Humboldt seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an answer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'll ask him and get back to
you on a feature feed What nutrients do I
[SPEAKER_01]: use I use God right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I using?
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK raw I mean it's just really it tends
to be whatever I have around as long as it
[SPEAKER_01]: has the correct NPK values that I need I
can use a plethora of different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need A line spelled out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very very simple Feeding cannabis
plants is extremely simple so so simple
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen with low pK in veg high nitrogen
low pK like a 5-1-1 In bloom you would be
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to a 1-5-5 or 0-5-5 It add Cal mad
add some beneficials add some What's that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff called that I like a lot Monosilic
acid You can you can add in some B
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamins, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it's not too complex and then
carbs carbs carbs and flour as well It's
[SPEAKER_01]: not complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole hydroponic industry was based on
people It's like a bunch of used car
[SPEAKER_01]: salesman man Yeah, see guy gotta have a
nursery permit gene knows yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah, I think I think the Emerald Cup
was the last big rodeo I Don't recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: seed vault because I've watched them rip
people off before and then change their
[SPEAKER_01]: name to seed vault Have you heard the term
unlocking your plant potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it but I mean that could mean
any number of things, you know I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: term grow with your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just grow your plant grow with your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Like that a lot because it's it's very
true grow with your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I get the virus out of my room
when I lost everything I didn't lose
[SPEAKER_01]: everything but most of everything got hit
I had to start from scratch lots of bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: throw a lot away Really really use some
hardcore chems back then to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: eradicate whatever it was happening I just
hit it with my my black death potion and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's only to be used in the most extreme
Circumstances when you have like the last
[SPEAKER_01]: of a last of a cut in existence in the
world and people are relying on you to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it alive That's when you use the
black death But you don't flower ever from
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a clone of a clone of a clone of
a clone to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah What virus what did it look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the best way I can describe this and
I'm gonna tell you right now It wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking powdery mildew It wasn't any kind
of normal mold spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really react to mold to mold
treatments It looked like a male hit my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole room and a layer of pollen was
sitting on all the leaves You could wash
[SPEAKER_01]: it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would go away you come back two hours
later and there it was again It was
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I trusted a dude from the Philippines
to send me a clone and What exists in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines doesn't necessarily exist in
the American cannabis world and What the
[SPEAKER_01]: clone was that I got it from I didn't see
anything too shaky on it, you know But it
[SPEAKER_01]: may have already built up a resistance
being a Filipino land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's That's wild I tried
everything with it and Eventually the last
[SPEAKER_01]: two cuts were saved but I had to go get
clockwork back from someone else I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a lot of stuff back from other People
I'd passed it to and if you've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: that situation, you know how hard that can
be Alright, I need to get ready for the
[SPEAKER_01]: giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's how the giveaway works Go like
the post that I posted earlier that

definitely come check those out,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're I mean, I Can't tell
you how rare it is to have someone with
[SPEAKER_01]: Mooney's experience That teaches all of
the guys who own and run the big labs Come
[SPEAKER_01]: and give you this information for free
that guy makes thousands and thousands and
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands per hour per consult So
definitely definitely definitely come
[SPEAKER_01]: check it out man like And like I said when
it comes to him, it's the only time I ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you bring your fucking a game bring your a
game It's just important man, like it
[SPEAKER_01]: shows a nice level of respect When you've
done your research and you come in here
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't ask crazy shit, you know
that you could ask Fucking some nerd at a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking hydroponic store Save the
questions for the nerds at the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: store that you couldn't ask me or Mooney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so any more questions time isn't out
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get the questions going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Also when this is over go to my buddy
other Cuban breeders live feed watch him
[SPEAKER_01]: learn some shit
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of these folks would get together
if 10 or 15 of us breeders I think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people would do it man It's just a
matter of getting us together to do it in
[SPEAKER_01]: one area where we can all make it Do you
believe Adam Dunn's bubblegum story?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I Definitely think tissue culture is a
future in a method that will either stop
[SPEAKER_01]: or prolong drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Tissue culture is the way of the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely is cloning is gonna be a
thing of the past And there will always be
[SPEAKER_01]: a place for cloning for quick quick clones
But tissue culture is the way of the
[SPEAKER_01]: future Gibraltar acid versus STS for
feminizing I would think GA3 would work
[SPEAKER_01]: better and you are incorrect GA3 is much
less effective GA3 is great for stretching
[SPEAKER_01]: plants However, GA3 doesn't necessarily
block ethylene on its own You need
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not only gonna increase
gibraltar acid in the plant, but will also
[SPEAKER_01]: block ethylene and that's where STS comes
into play You have a DNA holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wouldn't even admit that shit out
loud freak I wouldn't admit that shit out
[SPEAKER_01]: loud on its own DNA shit
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, it's it's a matter of of trying
to get us all together in the same spot
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a lot of there are plenty of us to
get along that that are very educated that
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a show together, but it's a matter
of getting us to a place where we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: travel to because Frankly, we're a bunch
of fucking hermits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a bunch of fucking hermits for real
total fucking hermits and We don't get out
[SPEAKER_01]: very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us can't leave our plants long
enough to get away that long Yeah Is cult
[SPEAKER_01]: classics RKS for me I don't think so I
don't know where there's this from Yeah,
