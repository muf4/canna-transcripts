[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_00]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_00]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_00]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, and I'm here with Dejan,
Goldcutt's brand from Austria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he is a gardener responsible for
producing many of the clones that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone around Austria in Europe for the past
20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have a discussion about
the climate in Austria specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clone market, the genetics there,
and what he's seen as far as the past
[SPEAKER_00]: several years, how it's changed,
and how it's affected what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to finally be here with
you and talk about a few things that may
[SPEAKER_02]: be interesting for some of you folks out
there who are not from Central Europe or
[SPEAKER_02]: from Austria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my homies from Austria.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do this, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what got you into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start there like we always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got you into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What made you so interested in genetics
specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all started with the cannabis
culture here in Vienna.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know that in the very
beginning, there was no wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your source for cannabis products was
either a hash bar, a legal hash bar,
[SPEAKER_02]: so not like a coffee shop in Amsterdam
where you go and you can order and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to wait for a half hour and six
hours to get your Moroccan, mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we all used to source our
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can imagine no one was very
pleased with going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it illegal hash bar or legal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The front was like a normal cafe or a
shady kind of cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rundown cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you had to wait like for two hours to
then to then buy cannabis or buy hash from
[SPEAKER_02]: a dealer that suddenly appeared out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until a certain time where everybody
was fed up with that, I can remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it started with me buying high
times magazines and seeing all those
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing plants and amazing flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, okay, there's
actually flower out there that I have to
[SPEAKER_02]: source somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it started with various
people who either got seeds from someone
[SPEAKER_02]: or ordered them or went to Amsterdam and
brought something back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collected bag seeds back then from
people who brought wheat back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of it was from Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it was just heapy bag seeds
from some dude from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it started with bag seeds that I
collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I'm a professional gardener,
I mean, I did apprenticeship and I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: master's degree in gardening and landscape
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to collect those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point I was like, hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived with my mom back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a garden in a public housing home,
a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an apartment in a public housing
complex here in the outskirts of Vienna.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started most of the seeds I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big ass bag full of mixed bag
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up with, I don't know,
200 different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did mom like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mom was first like, what is this
beautiful?
[SPEAKER_02]: She had no problems with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at a certain point it was just pissed
her off because she had to water them
[SPEAKER_02]: while I was at work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had to water your plants, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there on, I think it started to,
because I was blown away by the varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything was like, okay,
this is a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started to buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first seeds were from a shop
here, which were, I think, sense seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of them, and probably Positronix and
other stuff that they bought in bulk and
[SPEAKER_02]: then repackaged into smaller five units of
10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we bought those seeds and started from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought my first HPS, super
expensive, huge fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started, and unfortunately the guy
that did this first couple of tries turned
[SPEAKER_02]: out to be a kleptomaniac and got busted
because his cellar was full of stolen
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I almost got busted too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, that was a wake up call,
my first problems with the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never stopped from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to do it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once you get the bug, it's a
little hard to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see all these beautiful plants
and you've popped like 200 seeds and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see what the potential is, it's really
hard to back it off and just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, I'm done from here on out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially I never questioned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never asked myself, dude, is this a good
idea or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a very natural progression and
the law for gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I did my apprenticeship,
the boss told me, Dejan, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: specialize in something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to stay gardening,
you don't want to keep on gardening and
[SPEAKER_02]: being a gardener, you have to specialize
in the field and be the best you can be in
[SPEAKER_02]: this field.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was telling you to specialize in
something specific and to be the best at
[SPEAKER_00]: it possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best advice anybody
could give because realistically in this
[SPEAKER_00]: world, if you're not the best at what you
do, it's very hard to make a name unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're rich and can afford tons of
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way around being the best
at what you do and pure skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, I was a youngster and I had
no idea how this will work in the future
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I continued as a gardener and I
specialized in being a landscape gardener
[SPEAKER_02]: and arborist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cutting trees and cutting fruit trees.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one day after almost 10 years
working as a landscape gardener and tree
[SPEAKER_02]: mason or however you guys call it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met an old colleague who once worked
with me and he kind of introduced me to
[SPEAKER_02]: the legal cannabis industry in Austria
because I was not aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, you know, going to shops was kind
of scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this old school mentality where I
would not go to a shop and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: disclose myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was doing my cannabis thing but away
from all those shops who started to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started to have their copper strains
that they sold as clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy said to me, hey, you should
take a look at this one company where I
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are producing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, are you fucking kidding
me, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, come there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need gardeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are looking for gardeners and you are
a very good gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he knew me how I work as a
landscape gardener and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in general as the gardener who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went there and I was kind of
surprised how rudimentary everything was
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they worked and how they thought
the production should look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said to myself, you know what,
after 10 years, busting your ass in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cold and every weather outside and
climbing trees and sweating and full of
[SPEAKER_02]: two-stroke fumes and fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said to myself, dude, why not just
giving it a chance?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like it, you can still come
back and do what you did the last 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't really have a perspective in
landscape gardening and cutting trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I later found out that the skill of
cutting trees the right way helped me a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot in shaping mother plants and doing
what I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave me the best basis on how to
continue and learn how to improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and I started working there and
worked there for around, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: six years or longer, seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a major producer, the biggest
producer back then, the biggest production
[SPEAKER_02]: company in Central Europe for legal THC
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of clones are they producing at
the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what kind of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, they had a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started there, they had mostly the
selections that kind of were passed on
[SPEAKER_02]: from shop to shop or some people started
the 10 pack of, I don't know, Shiva's Kank
[SPEAKER_02]: or Afghani Delight or White Russian,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started with those and it kind
of went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember at a certain point,
the strains that we were offering were
[SPEAKER_02]: played out and everything was... I
remember it was dudding back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were already fucked genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, even back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mass produced and the symptoms I
remember with exactly what we are talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still was sold in pretty big
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could see it getting bigger and
bigger month after month and more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: and more because we were producing
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could come to the shop, do your
pre-order, place a down payment on your
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, three weeks from there,
you could pick up your order in discrete
[SPEAKER_02]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it continued to grow and
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to, you know, implement
some changes in the facility because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was, I mean, it was... Dude, crazy
dingle-dangle of cables everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking mess when I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: A mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was made out of wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no stainless steel or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we started to improve everything and
also adapt and change the electricity,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole breaker boxes and everything was
new and AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point, I couldn't get along
with the owners there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went a different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I continued to work for other person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, I worked for other person
and the other person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I am 20 years later, you know,
working for other person as a contractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also went to Styria for two years to
work for the largest CBD producer in
[SPEAKER_02]: Central Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very intense during COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was during the lockdown and
COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was traveling two hours in one
direction, two times a week to go there,
[SPEAKER_02]: work there till Thursday and then go back
to Vienna.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I learned a lot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot and implemented a lot of
changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really changed a lot because they had
their view on things, agricultural kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had my cannabis thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we improved a lot, but I've seen a
lot of bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one day I will tell those wild shit
stories of producing CBD in Styria,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know, I know going when I got hired
to do like that big hemp reversal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 13,000 class one, like I went in there
and it was an ad company with like
[SPEAKER_00]: middlemen that were kind of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will say they're cannabis people
because they sold weed, but really they
[SPEAKER_00]: were they were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the middlemen not being really good at
what they did, they hired me to consult on
[SPEAKER_00]: this reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to look and it's at a grape farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two weeks into flower outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yeah, so can we reverse
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, are you what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should have been doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to teach these guys how to
fucking revedge outdoors, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in these big greenhouses,
I had to get them to buy all these lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: revedge 13,000 plants so that we could
actually use the same plants and redo it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't want to kill anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like the ad people there are
very good at growing grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were masters at growing grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they thought that they could easily
apply this to cannabis, because if stoners
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it, why can't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of mindset fucking pervaded
all of it, all of it every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I said, it would be like,
well, well, you know, we do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I know what's
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hired me to consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying me a lot of money to
consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to take some advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're paying for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was it was it was both and it was
also super shady and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD industry, especially with I mean,
producing flowers with zero point two and
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's the way it worked in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like for a long time, we weren't
allowed to talk about it because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost akin to like airing out the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem was it sunk our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letting a bunch of these chads growing
hemp grow a bunch of THC in their fields
[SPEAKER_00]: shittily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tried to and they didn't try
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped that shitty weed on the black
market and crashed the black market with
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it was just so pervasive and
all throughout the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were growing they were growing
CBD flowers and hemp flowers that were
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of similar or they were working
towards having or offering CBD flower that
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of similar to to amnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So black market buyers could buy cheap
hemp, mix it with real amnesia and drop it
[SPEAKER_02]: on the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck comes up with ideas like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they found a way to cut weed
to cut it like like cocaine with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was also something where,
you know, I saw things where I said to
[SPEAKER_02]: myself, it's enough, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got paid really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was a great experience
and learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also heard a call from my CD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you have to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the person I work for now made an
offer that I thought was was good at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point and also brought me back to my
family because I have a six year old boy
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wanted to come back home and be with
him more and not spend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I drove.
[SPEAKER_02]: In two almost two years, I drove almost
70000 kilometers with my fucking car that
[SPEAKER_02]: I got from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too much driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a long distance trucker,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be driving.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came back and that's where I'm right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when I came back a couple of
months later, we kind of got into talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the idea of of of bringing in riot
seeds to central Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt I felt the need because I saw
what's going on in in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though some of it is some of the
stuff that is happening with new genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: or new crosses, some of it is I think is
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to talk down on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be just pure hating bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought I saw a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it just fucking breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two or three things that were a hype beast
and everything was obscure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't, you know, I couldn't,
you know, I was like, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like this bullshit and how it's
that, you know, the way it's going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really felt the need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with the legalization in your
country and things happening here in
[SPEAKER_02]: central Europe, I really felt the need to
I felt the need to kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start really thinking about what we are
doing and how we can improve it for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody or kind of not be part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds cheesy, I know, and I said that
often, but I really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my future work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all did bullshit in the past and
made mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's normally especially in cannabis for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about being part of a
better solution and kind of working
[SPEAKER_02]: towards this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think, was part of the
decision why we got married.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got married.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is and it was important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I don't exist in the European market
so much because I just don't have people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I trusted over there in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know people over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had fallouts with a lot of people
over there, you know, karma and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like you maybe to talk some about
maybe expand a little more on what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen and how it's gone down with as far as
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, who is big over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you seeing big over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it changed a lot from being people
being super skeptic and just boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're staple fucking European things or
the five, I don't know, white widow,
[SPEAKER_02]: decent, that Jack Carra.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't ever like, no,
fuck all this other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are happy with what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a staple European strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still it's grown good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at one point, people got really
curious because you legalized and you had
[SPEAKER_02]: this medical thing and me, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was super curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I connected globally and
started my network.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, people got curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there on, it started into
different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people offered the real deal or kind
of made did all the work and put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: effort to introduce people to the real
deal or some authentic cards or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the others were selling a selling a
dream or just then what the market was was
[SPEAKER_02]: screaming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want Kelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't hear this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how often people refer to Kelly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of the some of those
companies, some of those companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: are also not from the states who are based
in Spain also started to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in those names.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how authentic they were, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have to decide.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the seeds, you know, the seeds
that they sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: How authentic are those cuts, those those
seeds and the cuts that they use to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce those seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's it's often it's often really
it's sad that some of the people who crave
[SPEAKER_02]: for, let's say, just the Saudis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they buy some random Spain made sour
diesel from a company that buys them in
[SPEAKER_02]: bulk from a from a producer somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they expect this to be sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are 50 friends expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another hundred from the expect the
label that says Saudis to be sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's it's apples and and
and bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so some of the names you
probably know are pushing really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: towards towards this need for for
Californian or American names.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How authentic a lot of those are,
I don't know, because I haven't tried a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried a couple and none of it was even
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and now, especially now,
I see now I see a lot of things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought were already a thing of the past
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those people crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rainbow sharp crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cherry gelato and lemon cherry
gelato and lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, those those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are talking about a special cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are special lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a special lane that people choose
and want to buy and want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a lot of money on buying those seeds
and chasing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ziterp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, this has it's going to
be, you know, special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be really disappointing,
like for people who like it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get it and like,
oh, that's just great for it.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I just talked with one guy who who
bought some riot some riot seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked with him and he sent me a list of
what he started in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, dude, the whole list was full of
Z and sharps and Z and Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said everything was crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Zope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everything was crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told him maybe you should try some
and let him know how you like this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was very intrigued by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but it reflects that people
here spend a lot of money on what they
[SPEAKER_02]: think will sell as either flour or
concentrate or just just because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: name and the third profile, which is now
sharpened and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like because the American market
is so removed, even the American market,
[SPEAKER_00]: just alone, the American market is so
removed, like 99 percent of it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from real breeding and what's
going on with real breeders and real seed
[SPEAKER_00]: making and strain collecting and the few
who hold the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few people even know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that from Americans who kind
of all fall along the lines of fuck called
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds breeder of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't even make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you translate that to playing
telephone with Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Europe's trying seeing this,
trying to figure out what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: America to catch some of that hype thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're seeing like idiots as the
first thing representing America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they glom onto it instantly instead of
digging deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dug deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is so rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was one of one of the one of
the things that out there early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see the the both sides of the
medal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you guys said over there,
because for me, it was like looking into
[SPEAKER_02]: the future what what it will bring here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I see the downside, I can because it
will happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same things will happen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people call me, you know, all types of
things negative and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just hate them because you cannot
find a place for you in the legal game in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you hate in on it and shit like
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was always a big question for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the downside?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what what will what will happen if
those guys will, I mean, bottleneck the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole gene pool to just a lot of gelados
and fucking inbred times inbred times
[SPEAKER_02]: inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbred cookies is all we got over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't, you know, because you
mentioned breeding and who is a real
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people don't care who is a real
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they care about how can I sell this
product because X amount of people want to
[SPEAKER_02]: now have this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how big your milars are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you buy the right seeds now,
you save 90 percent milo to save the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to save the planet by only
using tiny milars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that happening a lot in this
chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in the next few days,
but I think with with all like with most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the trends, it would only last so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and there is a certain group,
a certain amount of people is a growing
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of people who are asking for,
hey, so what about can I heard about this
[SPEAKER_02]: and that diesel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which diesel and, you know, they ask the
right questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: questions that were not asked let's say 15
years back 15 years ago or 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that's the right way and
that's where I will always kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: gravitate towards this group and sharing
what I can learn from also trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: you know a good idea on the authentic cut
of the taste of this and hashiko
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if I can bring something back
and cultivate here that was always my goal
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring those seeds back and I did that
and I risked my ass bringing back a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds in my luggage to Europe and I pop
all those beans and with the hope to find
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I can share with my people
here absolutely yeah and I don't you know
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at all those breeders and catalogs
and offerings and people that I follow
[SPEAKER_02]: online I look at it and for me today it's
like a type of music that I don't listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to I don't have to look at it it's like
yeah it just you know I look at it like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a whole different industry because
like yeah it is they're reselling seed
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seed resellers so we're kind of in
the same industry but like I don't work
[SPEAKER_00]: with seed resellers I don't buy from
resellers so we don't I just like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not even my lane I don't give a shit what
goes on there like unfortunately it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects all of the business because people
think that is what we are because of them
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean but one of the most
important reasons I wanted to do this show
[SPEAKER_00]: too is because I wanted we have the
syndicate right we have our breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: syndicate and slowly people are forming
these small groups around the country but
[SPEAKER_00]: we have breeder syndicate people in Europe
and you're our rep in Europe for the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder syndicate and riot and I want
people to know who that is so they can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the face of it and be able to connect with
you right there this guy yeah I tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: react really quick on requests you know I
hope I didn't disappoint any of you guys I
[SPEAKER_02]: even tried to reach out in Spain during
the spannerbiss was a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointment but yeah those those events
like I've always wanted to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: spannerbiss because it sounds like a wild
party but like at the same time it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: like the events aren't like it used to be
even yes it's big it became really big it
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with Emerald Cup here we used to
put our our events we used to have our
[SPEAKER_00]: events around Emerald Cup because that's
where we'd all meet and sell seeds and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a big deal and we loved it and we
supported it a lot and then it became
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate and now it's just like I just
talked to Tim Blake today for that runs
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup and he said he wants to do
shows so I'm very interested to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: him too and be like you know like hey like
what you know this is what we saw we loved
[SPEAKER_02]: it why did it change you know question
yeah it's the influx I think the influx of
[SPEAKER_02]: people just the constant pouring in of
people here in Europe and yeah it's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be interesting in the next couple years to
see where we are heading especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany going going legal with his clubs
and you know all that it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting for me too because it's our
neighboring country and how it's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: impact everything here yeah and that's why
I think you know I want to I want to share
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of cuts because I feel like this is
this this golden time before the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: thing goes pop and yep goes completely
bananas when it goes when it goes legal
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I experienced it in your country when
I did my travels to the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely I was a card holder in in Kelly
and in Oregon yeah that's awesome yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how it was before everything went
crazy yeah and it was beautiful like to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest like prop 215 even though it wasn't
perfect like it was way better than what
[SPEAKER_00]: we have now so much better and and it was
sad that we saw cannabis people pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: for prop 64 and and people are just like
it's just California doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't affect me the fuck it doesn't Cali
effect California affects the world like
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens can be effective yeah yeah
that's what I'm saying like it was a big
[SPEAKER_02]: deal it was a real big deal for the world
and and you know I always try to share try
[SPEAKER_02]: to share my impressions and also share
this this kind of downside of it but
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't want to hear it today and I
you know I often got me pretty pissed at
[SPEAKER_02]: people because they don't want to hear it
yeah but I have to understand that this is
[SPEAKER_02]: how they want to do cannabis in the future
for them yeah so like you know you said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier you said you felt kind of silly
you know for saying like you know you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do something or you know what I mean
but that's like what I thought you know at
[SPEAKER_00]: a social activism level and that's what it
is like I don't like what I see I can
[SPEAKER_00]: either get mad and do nothing or I can
fucking try to set up a group so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: push back because that's all we got this
is all we got and if no one's doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: someone has to and and it seems like
there's a lot of us that have a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset that are slowly forming and
gripping together across the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: all have the same mindset we don't like
what we see we love we love genetics we
[SPEAKER_00]: love the plants and we see how bad and how
quickly it's gone from like having an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we have to just like bullshit like
as we pick through history we're realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't a single clone that got
popular that has perfect provenance on it
[SPEAKER_02]: with true stories there's none that's bad
and I think during that time in Vienna
[SPEAKER_02]: where I was a contractor for various
bigger producers people contacted those
[SPEAKER_02]: produce those companies and gave them
their parts of the library so yeah I got
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly we had Californian cuts and stuff
like that and I could see how it grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can cultivate all that and and it
changed so quickly that the old stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: disappeared and all the new stuff came in
and nobody asked for the old stuff anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we don't want to sound like
dinosaurs yeah sound like an old fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stubborn guy that's not what it is no no
not at all I've you know like when cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: popped up in you know and I got a hold of
it in two at the end of 2010 early 2011
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe mean might have been late 2011 some
like that but when we released the sea
[SPEAKER_00]: lion like we were trying to do unique shit
with it it was cool because no one had
[SPEAKER_00]: done anything with cookies yet so I was
thinking wow I can do some unique stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with this unique looking plant and
nowadays I regret ever touching it because
[SPEAKER_00]: like it contributed to the whole decline
of the gene pool in the end I just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know back then that everybody was gonna do
what I just did you know like I had no
[SPEAKER_02]: clue many was that wasn't I mean it was
good for all of us also was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first guys who got who cultivated a cookie
cookie hybrid here yeah because I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: came back from a journey on the west coast
trying all types of cookie crosses and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was okay I now understand why it's popular
and I tried to bring it back and sure I've
[SPEAKER_02]: also played my role in introducing a lot
of people to this particular to this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular plant that changed even it
changed shit here you know yeah it changed
[SPEAKER_02]: it everywhere because the bag appeal
started beautiful plants on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: started a lot and attract Instagram
Instagram to me changed the way people
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe because like before with Instagram
before Instagram you would have to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: forums to see people's inside their grows
for the most part you'd have to be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: little forum community a lot of people
didn't join that join those or weren't a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it and then you have the new wave
of people on Instagram and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is very visual everything's got
to be beautiful that you see if you see a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's old and doesn't have a lot of
resin it's not gonna get a lot of play
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's it's not easy to market like
why would I smoke that when I could smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: this frosty thing over here because people
don't understand what resin glands are and
[SPEAKER_00]: the oils they contain and all that stuff
so they don't understand visually that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't judge a plant visually like that but
cookies are so frosty and so beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Instagram generation it just
never changed after that everything has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be that level of resin or it's not
acceptable and because their mindset is
[SPEAKER_00]: and extractors and everything else that's
their mindset and they don't get it they
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't get it so yeah and then they
try for instance some hybrid out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue bonnet line yeah and they're like
wait a minute okay damn yeah you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: that with the blue bonnet it's been very
hard to resell blueberry right because
[SPEAKER_00]: blue there's been DJ shorts blueberry for
decades and yeah many people have spent
[SPEAKER_00]: good money on his blueberries and maybe
they were happy maybe they weren't most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely you know like if they were looking
for a true blueberry smelling plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like blueberry they probably
weren't super stoked because it's it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that but I mean it's in there it would
just take a lot of popping it but they
[SPEAKER_00]: were so expensive prohibitively expensive
to buy you know tons of packs of trying it
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of people tried it spent the
money and decided in their mind I've tried
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry I know what it's like I don't
like it it doesn't get me that high you
[SPEAKER_00]: know didn't really taste that blue so
coming along later and then say no I have
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry it tastes and smells like
blueberry it's people like yeah right I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I've already spent money on blueberry
why am I gonna try again so it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard sell it's been a very freaking hard
sell but I know it's so special and so
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to bring this back that I'm
stubborn on it like I'm not gonna I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna fold on it you know exactly exactly
but it's one of I think one of the one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the strains of flavors there was over all
those years most requests I got of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions say can you get a real blueberry
yeah like I mean a real blueberry like
[SPEAKER_02]: real blueberry or chemical blueberry
flavors yeah and I remember I bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple packs of short blueberry and I only
found woody kind of blueberry beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: looking it was beautiful but yeah was not
good but nobody will came back and asked
[SPEAKER_00]: for more I'll respect the DJ but you don't
see his cuts floating around like you have
[SPEAKER_00]: his his selected cut of 98 blueberry and
that's what most people use when they
[SPEAKER_02]: breed blueberry and that's it like his cut
yeah and I mean I know I know at least 10
[SPEAKER_02]: guys out there who spent between 200 and
1,500 euros on on blueberry seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: never found shit I mean are they all
idiots I don't know I don't think so but I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think so I mean I did the same I did
the same and why wouldn't you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's the guy who made blueberry
and so that's why I was intrigued when you
[SPEAKER_02]: you know explained everything and told me
the whole thing about about about the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: bonnet yeah and I said dude talk to the
couple people here and kind of try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a feel on is there any anybody interested
and a bunch of people were because they
[SPEAKER_02]: were fed up with gelato flavors oh I bet
and wanted something relevant or the real
[SPEAKER_02]: throwback yeah or more improved kind of
throwback yeah and also also potent not
[SPEAKER_02]: only chasing like that because I mean
there's a lot of tasty stuff out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not potent or yeah yeah I mean any
California orange or Skittles or any of it
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not potent but they but yeah now
this this is special and you know like I
[SPEAKER_00]: was hard to figure out what would sell in
Europe right because we have over here
[SPEAKER_00]: those sour obviously sells you know bubble
berry cherry berry all that stuff sells
[SPEAKER_00]: really well here but for Europe it's hard
to pick what would sell over there and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have yeah that was man up I was thinking
about this I don't know a couple couple
[SPEAKER_02]: days before we really set down and decided
what six we pick because I thought about
[SPEAKER_02]: you know certain things today I would
maybe change a couple of those choices
[SPEAKER_02]: that are made but we chose blister ring
blooper skunk cookie berry bubble berry
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark jet value blue and blue sour and
you had a blue bonnet bx1 that's right was
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out first yeah and that's the same
way with me the f2u is in bx1 and in cross
[SPEAKER_02]: sold out instantly every time yeah people
wanted to buy them for breeding projects
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and I can understand imagine some of
those guys like dude imagine a blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles you know like that so I worked
out because they were most of the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: were asking for what is the most blueberry
of all of them yeah that's easy but
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbleberry and cookie berries sold a lot
yeah people were asking for both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: those are very blueberry too there's some
heavy blueberries in those and the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: sour and very blue trademark chat also but
blue sour and very blue because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah people would you know love to have a
good good OG and a real or D what we
[SPEAKER_00]: consider real sour yeah that is the sour
you know what I mean like and it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: very sour we put up some beautiful
pictures two days ago and blue my my gg4
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that we gave away which was actually
me and josey were good friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue that him and lone wadi
developed gorilla glue you know rest in
[SPEAKER_00]: peace josey rest in peace josey and lone
but like that was the last projects we
[SPEAKER_00]: were working on in a collab he was working
with CSI on the glue 1000 which is a t1000
[SPEAKER_00]: glue cross which is one of josey's
favorite smoke and the glue blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: and when he passed that was the plan was
to release it together and because he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't we didn't I'm just mostly giving as
many out for free as I can because like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a fire ass line it's beautiful and
it's it's something special with me and
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe you know yeah she looks beautiful I
posted the pictures on the yeah right
[SPEAKER_02]: sitco Europe I can't do and I don't know
why I didn't pick her but we chose other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones because of certain reasons people are
curious and I can tell you guys I mean if
[SPEAKER_02]: you are talking about the price only
because that was often the main question
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it is a steal for what you get and
I'm not exaggerating okay I would never
[SPEAKER_02]: say that if it wasn't like this so if you
ever if you ever want to pick one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: or couple the price is always amazing and
and I mean what you get for that is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that some of those huge fucking
Milo guys can't offer and will never be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to think they can't but they can't
yeah they can't the best they can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done and what Lone Star did but they
don't know how to do that they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to select there's no way they don't
even know what the traits are to breed for
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean and that's that's
what it takes when you work blueberries
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing the traits to breathe yeah so I
mean they might be able to s1 one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: things and change the name but everybody's
gonna know what the fuck it is because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing this blueberry as it you
know so it's kind of nice as its own
[SPEAKER_02]: little stamp and I can't wait for the
first of our customers here supporters in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe to to I mean one of them already
showed me his blue bonnet px1 he's blown
[SPEAKER_02]: away I've had others others are you know
sure gonna come back with results very
[SPEAKER_02]: soon I think in the next couple of weeks
or months and I will share those with you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys to show I know that you want every
every single one of those showcased yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: in every aspect and super high resolution
we are working on that and we will you
[SPEAKER_02]: know show everything that we can in
regards to all of the hybrids and and
[SPEAKER_00]: always always and and he knows this and
and because of how he is like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would ask you to be transparent if
something sucks yeah it looks like shit
[SPEAKER_00]: put it up like something to me it's just
data points to me it's data points and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's bad in lines even lines
that I make that lines it my friends make
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a high ceiling you know and then
there's a floor in breeding yeah and I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to show it all because they're all
data points to me you know I love that I
[SPEAKER_02]: love that when people do that and are
honest yeah and and they're raking the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds because a lot of people asked yeah
what's up with feminized seeds isn't that
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the stuff that is offered to right
seat or right through Matthew to right
[SPEAKER_02]: seats is also there are some feminized
seats also and if you guys are interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in something that is offered on right
seats dot-com contact Matthew or me and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can work everything out yep it's not only
the bullet line yeah yeah if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and you want to get a hold of my
stuff hit a day on on Goldcutt or Right
[SPEAKER_00]: Seat Co Europe and get it to you we will
make it happen yeah no really not a big
[SPEAKER_02]: deal for us and we want to do that is I
think with with looking at the seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: are offered we have to do this you know
that's why I stepped in with you and and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to do this I'd like to eventually
get out like the whole syndicates group
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out there like high and lonesomes
you know all that stuff eventually get it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there so everybody can get everything
in Europe from from people that are vetted
[SPEAKER_00]: by our breeder syndicate groups that's the
thing like people see like I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: consider what I have on my site a seed
bank at all because I never wanted to run
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed bank it has nothing to do with that
all it is is our group of friends and the
[SPEAKER_00]: only reason people have made it into our
group of friends is because we fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: have vetted every each other super fucking
heavy and it's built up over years and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are guys that I would put my own
reputation behind like I don't do that
[SPEAKER_02]: with people I don't know but that's as
real as you can get yeah if I look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: list now and breathe a syndicate all the
guys who contribute to I mean that's some
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing stuff is yeah just you have to
look at it both to breathe a syndicate and
[SPEAKER_00]: follow and take a look at it and decide
for yourself me and CSI we just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about it yesterday and we're gonna do some
Giesel Fem projects on Tunes soon too yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so bringing Giesel back the S1s the
hybrids and a lot of hybrids I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: made so I'm really stoked to see Giesel
hit like I don't know TK I will reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: you did the Giesel TK what is he what is
in there Giesel Chem 1 will be interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: Giesel he did the Giesel Chem 91 and I
haven't run that yet with I think he
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed the Chem 91 onto the Giesel but
we're gonna reverse the Giesel onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91 but those are fucking phenomenal
like Giesel Urkel oh yeah Giesel Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that like oh there's so
much to do and it's like it's a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk everybody wants super skunk
and even in Europe everybody wants old
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky stuff right and it's there yeah I
mean the expectation I think is different
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think people will be surprised if
they try this hair Giesel today Giesel was
[SPEAKER_02]: available in Vienna long time ago oh
really remember it looks exactly like your
[SPEAKER_02]: Giesel yeah and I remember it being super
potent skunky very very heavy smoke yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good shit it's really good it's my
favorite of the chems and diesels all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them combined it would be my favorite even
over soured and it's frustrating because
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have a good name I think that's
why it didn't sell Giesel is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that like not diesel it's not chem
you know but it's it's super skunk and it
[SPEAKER_00]: had they called it just super it would
have sold that they called it Giesel so it
[SPEAKER_00]: just never I'm telling you it's crazy it
drives me nuts because it's probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunkiest thing left that's inherited
apparently skunky that you can breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: and just people just like Giesel what are
you gonna do but I think I can communicate
[SPEAKER_02]: it here in a right in the right kind of
the right fashion to make it really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because people know I mean
people know super skunk here yeah I think
[SPEAKER_02]: they would be surprised what kind of what
kind of profile they would find and what
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was show them in regards to the
new stuff that is around it's even
[SPEAKER_00]: different than you know this it's
different than European super skunk that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still around because European super skunk
what looks super skunky it tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sweet and this is a very early 90s
first year super skunk type and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would blow their minds it
seriously blow their minds to be a blast
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past but like I said it's even in
America with people everyone wanting skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's called Giesel like very few
get it no matter I could stomp scream spit
[SPEAKER_00]: it don't matter people ain't gonna listen
I hope that they figure it out eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yeah we will continue to talk
about it and also I think Giesel will the
[SPEAKER_02]: Giesel blue bonnet will be one of the next
selections that I want to do it's special
[SPEAKER_00]: there's and again with Giesel blue bonnet
because it's super skunk it there there's
[SPEAKER_00]: booth in there there is but there is
straight fire in there too we did a one
[SPEAKER_00]: called triangle choke that's a Giesel it
was the Giesel I'm sorry triangle Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse Giesel across the blue bonnet and
that in there is some of the most resinous
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff it looks like it could be a fucking
wedding cake type plant but it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry jam just insane we have an
insane cut going around right now over
[SPEAKER_00]: here there's just fire and it has all it
ticks all the boxes for the looks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram kids which still is just
absolute fire and whereas it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the skunky notes it's all blueberry jam in
that one which is crazy yeah I can't wait
[SPEAKER_02]: for hash has make a scene you're about to
try some of it yeah some of those crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: because people ask me so the crosses the
blue ball blue bonnet crosses tend to or
[SPEAKER_02]: are specifically bred by Matthew to
improve let's say the GMO yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not to give the GMO a blue bonnet taste
it's to improve the GMO and that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing amazing opportunity for guys
out there to get a GMO line that is
[SPEAKER_02]: shotgun flower and improved in some of the
aspects of the GMO maybe it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: it GMO to me is a great plant but the
biggest problem is that like it's hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people to cash crop because it's
longer flowering to get it super day that
[SPEAKER_00]: the bonnet is so fast that it decreases
the time and it's a very like when people
[SPEAKER_00]: think about blueberries some of them have
this blueberry sativa type thing in their
[SPEAKER_00]: head and this is a blueberry Afghan type
plants very cushy and and very frosty and
[SPEAKER_00]: very dense so it keeps the density and the
beautiful frostiness of GMO but it
[SPEAKER_00]: shortens the flower time dramatically I
think that's what most people are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for which you know they want to keep those
turps but have the flowering time
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically you know reduced which which
one would you recommend for outdoors I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean for let's say a central European
outdoor let's see what's left what's over
[SPEAKER_00]: there right now I mean like it doesn't
matter because I would I would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend bubble berry over there probably
better it is the shortest for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: season and because of the moisture he can
handle moisture without molding and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: so fucking important you know for central
Europe and all those places yeah that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I recommended for some of the guys
asked you hey what do you what would you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend for central European outdoor
kind of setup in a garden or a glass house
[SPEAKER_02]: or a hoop house and I always thought the
bubble berries would be probably the best
[SPEAKER_00]: choice the bubble berry blistering also
does well this one does real well outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and and can handle the the mold because of
the blue bonnet what else is really good
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor the cherry berries really good
outdoor with ak-47 trademark Chad super
[SPEAKER_00]: good outdoors we've seen a lot of that
done outdoors in California
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I think that I think that was one of
the ones that I was like well Durban's
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra paneling it's all which hazel so
maybe maybe people won't buy it but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it'll make a cool cross and it
turned out like you can find like not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite skunky but like garbagey smelling
stuff in it too like the the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed didn't just turn out blueberry to
paneling there's wild stuff in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would never expect and it is super
resinous I mean it's just all the boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: too and that's that's one of the reasons
why like I'm usually one of those guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: would like I work on something for a while
and then I move on to the next because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bad ADHD and I want to do something
new always want to do something new and do
[SPEAKER_00]: its next I haven't moved on from the
bonnet work because it's like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: find a male that is that predictably
predictable for breeding gang you never
[SPEAKER_00]: want to move on because that's rare that
is so rare to have a male that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: predict how he will always breed with
everything that's the ultimate tool so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like why you move on when I found the
best thing that I've ever bred with you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I mean but yeah your reaction I
remember your reaction back then and I
[SPEAKER_02]: could I could tell hey okay this guy found
something that checks all the boxes and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so predictable and it also showed me
that the breeding goals because I tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to not find them in most of the
guys out there where's your fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding goal what are you what what what
are you even what are you trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish polyhybrid times polyhybrids or
what I mean and that I was oh that's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in intriguing yeah I think I think
that's not even a common mindset when it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be in seed making is what am I
trying to achieve I have an idea I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like a strawberry plant plant there's
strawberry turps that maybe grows like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know just whatever and then you you then
you go from there I think what plants what
[SPEAKER_00]: material do I have that can achieve this
goal what can achieve closest what do I
[SPEAKER_00]: think and I can take few generations in
and met work it that way but most people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like I want to see what happens if you
cross this man I'm thinking I if I cross
[SPEAKER_00]: this to this and it doesn't achieve my
goal I have failed and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: release it you know that's the same with
some running small selections that I do
[SPEAKER_02]: here yeah but I don't find anything good I
will probably never offer it or never ask
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are no hair there's a cut this
is something that I found yeah but what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to ask you if I can is there
something that you were thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: working on in regards to a new a new cross
to totally new thing is there something
[SPEAKER_02]: that would where you would say man somehow
can't even explain like beautiful art I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't explain why I like it but I would
love to have it or do it or make it or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever so there's a line from
Switzerland called perpareia tichenensis
[SPEAKER_00]: or sorry perpareia tichenensis yeah
tichenensis or something like that some
[SPEAKER_00]: weird way they pronounce it it's from
Felix at Alseeds and it's an ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it really holds not much THC value
and it probably isn't even that good but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a it's it's what I call a base purple
line where it's a line that has been in
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's garden for a long time that's
naturally purple that's heavy purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: that breeds true for purples that hasn't
really been injected into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: pool much like it's something that stayed
out of the cannabis pool like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: erdpert and we have we have that's it yeah
remember yeah yeah barely yeah which is
[SPEAKER_02]: also a purple swiss indica I think it's a
refer to as a as a pre-soviet indica or
[SPEAKER_00]: something yeah that's one of those things
where it's like in in cannabis is for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason people decided that when the
soviets invaded that afghanis got bad you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like I see that all the time like I
got a pre-soviet afghan bro as if the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in the valleys they couldn't
keep their seats the soviets were there
[SPEAKER_02]: soviets came and took all their shit yeah
exactly they tried like like the the
[SPEAKER_02]: afghani government is trying now but
there's no fucking way to do it now
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately that's one of the lines you
would like to do yeah yeah I mean I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: if and nobody's really asked me that but I
think like the first thing that comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: mind is perforated just because it's
something I haven't touched and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another one I'd like to go back and work
that I have worked with and dutch passion
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me the mother seeds for and they got
lost in the mail they never made it it
[SPEAKER_00]: killed me is is purple number one and
purple star and that's because it's a base
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's an old purple afghani and it's a
very old purple afghani and it's it's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of old dutch stuff and I don't know it
just fascinates me I've used it it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that great but for some reason I want to
go back to it and it's just one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things where it's like I just there's no
rhyme or reason that these two base
[SPEAKER_00]: purples because I've always been like more
than anything I've been a purple chaser my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life for canvas I love the color
purple whether it's my shirts or
[SPEAKER_00]: headphones or I know I kind of recognize
it yeah I everything's purple so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I I am I gravitate towards beautiful
aesthetics in the garden like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me to look go in there and
see beauty and purple is part of beauty to
[SPEAKER_02]: me for some whatever reason yeah man I
hook you up with purple number one if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want some I do I do I like I have I have
old purple number one regular seeds but I
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt they'd pop anymore they're so old
yeah they're still sold yeah yeah dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion still sells them yeah they're sold
in Vienna I think I I worked at a shop at
[SPEAKER_02]: a grocery shop for time also yeah and I
had to have a job it was yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: struggle times yeah we all remember them
then them being in the fridge purple
[SPEAKER_00]: number one yeah it's it's a it's not even
that good of a strain but something about
[SPEAKER_00]: it like the way its turps are very weird
and unique and I think I think I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: something cool with it it's almost like a
plasticky vinyl type with milk it's weird
[SPEAKER_02]: but plastic in one burned one or no like
fresh water like a fresh new couch final
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm or maybe opening a brand new record
and smelling it I don't know it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: smell but it's to me it's a pleasant smell
like not sour milk but just like fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: milk and by it's weird but prepare it to
Genente I've never smelled I have no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: what those turps are like on that plant
the ones that I remember and at barely an
[SPEAKER_02]: ad part yeah they were quite similar they
had a wild berry taste to them like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: if you buy if you know wild berry haribos
no you ever had I send you back there they
[SPEAKER_02]: taste like like concord grapes and berries
you know this kind of overripe very taste
[SPEAKER_02]: or great taste and make sure of this kind
of a musky grape I like that and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: our people people would I think some
people today would say it would be taste
[SPEAKER_00]: purple yeah yeah it probably heavy in
anthocyanins and that's what they're and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a taste to it like
anthocyanins or smell but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people inherently smell
this smells purple this tastes purple yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: and and hashy I remember them being very
hash in the in the taste profile and yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: very very Afghani like yeah it's a very
early Afghani so I want to chase it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not like I'm chasing a skunky Afghani in
this case it's more like chasing an
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani that is pretty pure and untouched
old world my problem is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanis now and a lot of the Moroccans
and Lebanese during the the mid to late
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s and early 2000s DNA and those groups
went down there and you know flooded that
[SPEAKER_00]: area with their seeds sold seeds to all
the farmers and now like people are all
[SPEAKER_00]: excited that the they're collecting land
races from Afghanistan from these groups
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of them like you see them
they're pink and purple like then you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck you think this is like you know I
mean there's very few purple Afghanis like
[SPEAKER_00]: pink magenta Afghanis that we know of like
there's or Paki's there's Chitrali and
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitrali and like purple number one so
it's possible but a lot of these we know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're infected with modern genetics and
that's what's mostly down there now and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's catastrophic but it is catastrophic
and it's more catastrophic because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: land race collectors now that are experts
online that are only collecting this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because they only got in during this era
and don't have stuff from before that and
[SPEAKER_00]: now they're breeding with it calling it
land races and starting a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: community of people that think this is all
land races because they haven't done the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and it drives me nuts it's like
blind leading the blind leading the blind
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know they have good intentions they
have good intentions you know I know they
[SPEAKER_00]: do and they're probably passionate people
about genetics and it's like trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain to them that they probably don't
have access to this stuff anymore is like
[SPEAKER_00]: too much for them they know of course we
do I have it I paid money oh yeah yeah you
[SPEAKER_00]: paid money exactly I paid money for it
this is real it turns it into reality if
[SPEAKER_02]: you pay enough money just throw enough
money on it and then yeah now you yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them emotionally invested in it is
what it does yeah I can recommend the
[SPEAKER_02]: people to look at what's his name Iria
Singh yeah yeah look at his account and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you will see the real Afghanistan the
real Balochistan and how the press look
[SPEAKER_02]: there and yeah what they what those
farmers do yeah there's been some great
[SPEAKER_00]: videos there there's a land race
selections I think it is he was gonna do a
[SPEAKER_00]: view through like go through the fields as
they were collecting and stuff but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: like my experience with a lot of land race
Afghanis isn't what people think of as
[SPEAKER_00]: like dense cushions that are super frosty
like it's usually airy hermaphroditic like
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter squatter plants but some of them
go like fucking 12 weeks you know in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field and get real tall in these Afghani
for hash production not for flow yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly only only women and peasants were
smoke yeah smoke flowers yeah is it not
[SPEAKER_00]: like the women and slaves yeah damn they
still talking slaves in Afghanistan but
[SPEAKER_02]: but they look beautiful and I mean it's
looking to the past but it's like looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at a dinosaur for me yeah and I want to
get them before they're gone because no
[SPEAKER_00]: one's collecting per peria did you need to
your fucking purple number one for for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation no one's looking at them for
that and I don't want them to be gone
[SPEAKER_02]: during my time at the big production
company in Vienna I cultivated the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pupuriya one of the Pupuriya trikinesis
the yet barely Alpine rocket and remember
[SPEAKER_02]: that and what was one more or two more
Swiss genetics that we got from from the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys who cultivated them in high elevation
well that has been you're referring to as
[SPEAKER_02]: been hybrids from hell I think hybrids
from hell and other people in this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: circle yeah far away from the mountains
there I almost forgot Esbin and I should
[SPEAKER_00]: say this because he's he's done more work
with Erdpert and stuff that I totally
[SPEAKER_00]: spaced but he's a legit fucking dude
hybrids from hell if people are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm talking about and you can have
access to get these shipped in hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: from hell he's a great dude he's been
around forever and he has great Swiss
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics so check him out too yeah you
often talked about Mephisto genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: because people ask a lot for hey do you
recommend is there any others that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would recommend yeah and I think you
talked about Mephisto a couple times in
[SPEAKER_02]: very good that that's legit stuff and yeah
yeah he seems to be doing decent work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it real decent work with autos and like
I'm not a big auto person myself I was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first Americans to like bring autos
over make feminized autos and sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: like seven but I didn't I don't maybe I'm
wrong maybe I'm wrong and I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way I don't find a way to make
autos that I'm happy with if that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense I think that there's a place for
autos when it comes to breeding because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think young breeders that want to learn
how to breed for traits the auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: are one of the best ways to do it
especially if you get like auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: doors from buddha seeds in Spain not big
buddha seeds buddha seeds in Spain the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest in peace big Buddha yeah rest in
peace Milo yeah for sure but buddha seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain they have dwarf autos that finish in
60 days from seed and that way you can if
[SPEAKER_00]: you if you're breeding for traits it's a
great way to learn how to breed for traits
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast and very fast generations and
that's about the most I got for autos is
[SPEAKER_00]: is they're great for breeding and learning
breeding yeah people here ask for it and I
[SPEAKER_02]: try to explain them why do you take an
auto that needs more light and takes
[SPEAKER_00]: longer makes no fucking sense yeah yeah
like normal normal autos that take 110
[SPEAKER_00]: days or 90 days it's like what the fucking
point 20 hours light yeah I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to people because like they
don't understand the light stuff the light
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it you know and that's why I say
if you choose right seeds it's all regular
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds yeah often tell the people they ask
me a lot they are they feminized you have
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the blue bonnet feminized they are
all regular seeds for now yeah we will do
[SPEAKER_00]: some blue bonnet fems eventually yeah it's
hard because my reputation is feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds too and making the spray the fem
spray so everybody just assumes my stuff's
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized but I like I prefer regular
breeding I actually wish more people would
[SPEAKER_00]: do regular breeding because it's an art
selecting males and so much that way and
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's nothing against it I love them
and I've learned it's just a different
[SPEAKER_00]: tool to me it's just a whole different
tool set to learn different ways but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I I love regular breeding and I love
selecting males and usually like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: people ask me what trait I look for in
males in breeding it's usually their butt
[SPEAKER_02]: cheeks I like males yeah totally you
should look for that and maybe smelly butt
[SPEAKER_02]: cheeks yes smelly butt cheeks sweaty
anyway yeah what I yeah I haven't asked
[SPEAKER_02]: you the question and I don't want I don't
want to take it on a kind of negative
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective but the one that I asked you
remember what would you what would you or
[SPEAKER_02]: what is your perspective or how could you
see Europe legalizing or having adult
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational cannabis and and licensed
producers and you know the shit that you
[SPEAKER_02]: got going on I you know because people
don't have I think people don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: about it often enough what kind of fucking
gate gate to hell we could open no so one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I didn't know and recently I've
been kind of learning is that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some spots and countries in Europe that
generally care about their people and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want corporate taking over and want
to protect their legacy farmers but it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like that is few and far between
usually money wins the day we've seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US like harborside was the big player
for a long time they were the main one
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have the money to play they
are gone like they you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: like Steve D'Angelo is crying over prop 64
that he pushed it now he didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: money to play so there is so much money
going around that it's gonna be enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: sway countries enough to buy all the
lobbyists they ever need to sway
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians to vote these things in the
benefit of the pharmacies and
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically the only way I see I see any
sort of path for these plants and these
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and and clones being saved and
not being lost due to no one wanting them
[SPEAKER_00]: and it costing money to keep moms alive is
doing exactly what we're doing one by one
[SPEAKER_00]: people talking they have any sort of
influence over their community they have
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of care it doesn't mean even if
you don't have influence build that
[SPEAKER_00]: influence make it happen make a fucking
dink stand up because there's ways like
[SPEAKER_00]: their are countries in Europe that seemed
to care I don't mean baby maybe comes I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not there I it may be it's a different
story but from looking from the outside it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like there are countries that are
trying to keep corporate out to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: the legacy farmers and that will never
happen the US and just if will not our
[SPEAKER_00]: countries to money driven and corrupt I
saw happen with California but for that I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw what happened in the Netherlands with
um bedrock on and that's what i was like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to happen here that is going
to happen here one main source that's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal to grow where everybody has to buy
from that's what i see happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: california and if europe's not careful
it's going to happen there and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to end up with walmart weed and that
sucks no choices yeah man that's uh i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know you know i don't want to be
alarmed but that's what i often felt or my
[SPEAKER_02]: gut feeling kind i was like this can
totally happen here and imagine that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: talented guys would beg for a job in a
fucking huge facility just to pay their
[SPEAKER_00]: bills and shit like that you know so what
happened what happened in the u.s what i
[SPEAKER_00]: saw was people like not so dog for example
or you know legacy farmers that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this a long time they got hit you
know when they were when they were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market side they got ptsd from
getting rated and they got the choice to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with corporate and wanted to have a
nice life for their families and not be
[SPEAKER_00]: scared right these corporate guys raped
them raped their knowledge raped their
[SPEAKER_00]: clones every last thing they could they
squeeze the juice out of these legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and i don't know anyone working
for a big corporation that's happy because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happened to all of them and i don't
like i can't think of one i can't not
[SPEAKER_00]: think of one person that worked for a big
corporate thing that was a good person
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like i'm happy with this i got a
good deal here it just hasn't happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: i think it's probably going to happen over
there in europe the same way the legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers there they're going to want to you
know get a piece think they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some money and have a good life and
legal life because they haven't had that i
[SPEAKER_00]: think maybe they'll think they'll get
retirement or whatever i think you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they think logic or very simple like maybe
i also did i felt like an an old football
[SPEAKER_02]: player a european soccer player who just
wants a secure job in saudi arabia is
[SPEAKER_02]: playing playing as a the captain of the
team there getting good you know paid well
[SPEAKER_02]: but has no fucking future and no
perspective yeah it's exactly what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and and now all those corporate places
that that were hiring these people they
[SPEAKER_00]: bottomed out money-wise so all these
legacy farmers that were already unhappy
[SPEAKER_00]: the bosses that were bling in wearing the
rolexes really making the money they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all broke too now they're all done selling
their properties they're on the next the
[SPEAKER_00]: next commodity whatever the next hot
commodity is because they won't yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what people should think about you
know that these guys will move on they
[SPEAKER_02]: have more money than people all together
you know ever have on hand to use in a
[SPEAKER_02]: project you know i don't want to be like i
said i want to be alarmist but people have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware of that that will can totally
happen because we have a lot of money in
[SPEAKER_02]: central europe people who spend a lot of
money lots of money i mean america
[SPEAKER_00]: borrowed money from central europe to
start like they you know you mean they
[SPEAKER_00]: started our country like there's a lot of
money there people forget how much money
[SPEAKER_00]: is going around in central europe and how
important a player it is and i don't i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't consider it alarmist because we've
watched it happen and cycles happen and
[SPEAKER_00]: history repeats itself and i consider it
realist you know like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider it alarmist but it's
realist like when prop 64 happened
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody said oh you're just making a
steam shut up let these guys make their
[SPEAKER_00]: money they've worked hard you know and i
was screaming atop my lungs and back then
[SPEAKER_00]: they called me an alarmist i was right i
was fucking right and i didn't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: right i wanted to be so wrong i wanted to
be the wrongest person ever and i would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been happy to be wrong but i think i
just don't see any difference
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately because there's money at the
end of the whole thing and there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same players going over to europe the same
shitty seed sellers that failed in in
[SPEAKER_00]: america or blew up in america went over
there now because they see opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: so like you know the aficionados the
compounds go over there nobody trusts to
[SPEAKER_00]: get red carpet treatment yeah they get the
red carpet treatment because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know how bad they fucked everyone
in america and why they're not here and
[SPEAKER_00]: why nobody likes them here you know but
that's how it plays they they're playing
[SPEAKER_00]: telephone they're trying to catch up years
years past yeah it's it's crazy and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only time will tell and show i what and
what i hope what i hope this podcast to
[SPEAKER_00]: cheese is that the people in europe
realize oh my god there's one of us that's
[SPEAKER_00]: over here that's dialed in that
understands what's going on and i hope
[SPEAKER_00]: they all realize that and realize that

[SPEAKER_00]: how to become a part of the solution not
the problem there are a bunch of guys
