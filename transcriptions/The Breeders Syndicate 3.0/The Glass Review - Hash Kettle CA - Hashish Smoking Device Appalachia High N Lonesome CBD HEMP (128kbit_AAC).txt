[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_01]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_01]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to be doing reviews,
and today I'm going to review the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: kettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of the time when we review glass
on here, it's almost always C2 because,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they're my homies and it's my
favorite glass on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I've been seeing like this hash
kettle thing online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I've always said, we don't do
sponsored reviews, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We never do sponsored reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of our own money, I went and bought
this beautiful, it's actually stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a showpiece, a beautiful yellow
fumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see in this video,
but it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yellow fumed glass and it has a pink
inside thing where you put the snake and a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice top that goes on, keeps the hash in.
Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the little pink top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to put it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Hash Corporation Canada Hash Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it says or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be reviewing this, paid for it,
not sponsored, wholehearted review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the one thing I learned with these,
do not use like dry sift that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: really like really clean dry sift that
you've pressed into hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first you have to make a hash snake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really nice hashish from High
and Lonesome of Appalachia, which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of one of the perks of this shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to have people like High and
Lonesome send me his own Appalachian hash
[SPEAKER_01]: killer to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the requirement is that it's hashish
with a lot of very unclean hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be, or it won't burn in the
snake properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't smoke in the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mess when it's too pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I already tried that once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time we are going to try to
attempt it with a little bit less clean of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sift and see how this thing smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are going to see it for the
first time with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first test to see if it's clean enough
to smoke is lighting the snake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the process of the
hash kettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the snake and you light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's going!
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the snake in here like so.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, the snake is in here lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually one of the nicest hash
smoking tools I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to put it on top of a bowl
with other weed to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a straight up hash experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how it's actually functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super smoky in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I clear it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see the hash snake burning on its
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got oxygen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a little oxygen coming in here,
just enough to keep it burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the lid on it, it catches it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the smoke's just going downwards
now towards the oxygen coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sit here and puff this whole
damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably have to edit because that's
really boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watching me sit here and smoke this
whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me see what the price on these is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Kettle Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash Kettle Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can get massive hits off this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for $149.95, which is actually a really
great price, you can get the Hash Kettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is pretty, pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty faboo, I must say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I paid a little more for this one
just because of the yellow fumed part,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I haven't wanted to use it too
because it's just so beautiful and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get it dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually keep it in my display cabinet
because it's so pretty next to the
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork orange dab rig, which I guess
I've got to fucking show off some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate using my pretty glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I mess it that I'm scared I'm
going to break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like this is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snake keeps smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can sit here and talk,
shoot the shit, smoke as I please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't burn up too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful Appy Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is rather nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, Hash Kettle Canada, Hash Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hash Kettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, this has got a pink top,
pink inner side, yellow fuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do make it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's special editions that are released.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they were super nice,
easy to deal with, came fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like the the normal un-fumed
ones are 149.95 Canadian, wherever you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go Google Hash Kettle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure any of those places will do.
