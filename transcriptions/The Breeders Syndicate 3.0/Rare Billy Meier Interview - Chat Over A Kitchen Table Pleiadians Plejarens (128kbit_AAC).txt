[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of touchy tripod going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for earthquake shooting,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know last night we were talking about
if you are in the ship and you go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the year of 32 and you die there and We
were we weren't clear if you die in 32 on
[SPEAKER_01]: a trip your spirit stays there then it has
to live forward again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So you wouldn't come back to 1988?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay in 32?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to spend the life again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that time from the past to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd have to go from 32 all the way
back to 1990.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Okay, I think we can just talk a little
bit about spirit forms probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest the Spirit forms that we are what
is the difference between spirit and
[SPEAKER_01]: spirit?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a difference because spirit
form or spirit that's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we are talking about the human
being we are speaking from the spirit form
[SPEAKER_00]: in the human being and generally we speak
from the spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the spirit form goes through many
material lives and what is the purpose of
[SPEAKER_01]: the material life?
[SPEAKER_00]: The human have to stay in a material life
to study to learn to get a good evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason why he lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he dies the spirit or the spirit
form goes to the other side and he studies
[SPEAKER_00]: there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the whole study is fulfilled there
in the other side then the spirit form
[SPEAKER_00]: returns to the earth into a new human body
and then it starts everything from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible to be born on another
planet than the one you die on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are on this planet if you are living
on this planet and you die then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to reincarnate on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to leave this planet as a
spirit form because this spirit form is
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed to this planet where the material
body died.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take to come back into a
new life?
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal tournus is by 150 and 2 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now in the new age, the new time there
is everything changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a big overpopulation and
all of the laws are somehow broken and the
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit forms who goes to the other side
they have to return out of the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they will be in the other side for
10 years or 30 years or 70 years and not
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 and 2 and then they have to return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these all about the overpopulation we
have on the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible for us normal people to
contact the other side?
[SPEAKER_01]: No it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are around the world 16 people who
are able to get contact with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side but not any one of them will go out
to tell somebody I am able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it isn't necessary and it isn't
the right way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody says he has a contact with the
other side, with people who died then he
[SPEAKER_01]: is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think many people think they are in
contact with people from the other side
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the other side is a world just
like this and they go visit them all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side there is only the
spirit right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no personality?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people around this world
who say that they have contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side or with aliens or with demons
or devils or what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most of them is illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an overturned mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are out of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the Pleiadians have the ability to know
when a woman is pregnant for instance on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pleiadian world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the Pleiadians tell who the spirit is
coming in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes they have the possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: How soon can they tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do they know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do this in a very short time
maybe 20 minutes, half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they go to recognize what happened
there, which spirit is there in the new
[SPEAKER_00]: baby who is created.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the possibilities on a
meditative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that helps them understand who the
spirit is then so they have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to help that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this would be good for school,
for education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy one of the most common questions is
there are a lot of people on earth and
[SPEAKER_01]: many people would like to know if it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do the Pleiadians contact you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a special reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a special reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm the single one on earth who is
able to have no physical contact or no
[SPEAKER_00]: telepathic contact with the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no other human being on earth who
is able to do the same thing like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a very long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back to a very old time on the
start of the Lura picture and the Vika
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Alevo who is called Arahat Ater
Zata.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spirit form was very long time ago,
million, billion years, trillion years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: in the level of the Arahat Ater Zata and
came back to the human world to teach the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the true abode about creation
and they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens on the Lurian planets and the
vegan planets and then at a later time on
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth too because the old Lurians and
vegans came to earth and the old spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: form of my spirit form came with them in a
human being who was teaching the people
[SPEAKER_00]: here on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on earth we have a very true line
from the oldest time up to today where I
[SPEAKER_00]: have done always the same job,
the same mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think your mission, will there be
more lifetimes for the mission?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there have to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Pleiadians are related to us
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of us maybe are Pleiadians some
people think or Lurians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not Pleiadians on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are old Lurians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vegans on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a leadership by 144,207
different people and they were leading all
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lurians and vegans who came from the
star picture there to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: By some 50 or 52 million people from Vega
and Lura.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have alien spirit forms on earth
then only Lurians and vegans and from the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet Malona who destroyed in our solar
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are about around about 50 or 55
million and other aliens we haven't on
[SPEAKER_00]: earth without them who are coming here for
visiting or exploring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people who think they maybe they
used to live on a Pleiadian world and you
[SPEAKER_01]: think there are any spirits here that used
to be Pleiadians?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleiadians, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy one of the more interesting things I
think that the stories we've heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: is your time travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very fascinating because time is
something that's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things we've
learned many people would like to know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go back in time like you have in
the ship is it possible to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: change history?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you change right now if you went back
in time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No you can't change history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh you can't?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would happen if you went back say 100
years and changed your parents or caused
[SPEAKER_01]: them not even?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go back to kill somebody that
you know shall be living today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible to go back to change
your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened, what was going on is what's
going on and is not changeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit a funny idea of the
human being to can do something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the movie you can do such
things but in reality it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible because there are laws and then
you don't can go to break because these
[SPEAKER_00]: are laws of the creation and the creation
with the creation you can't play until not
[SPEAKER_00]: with the laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy one of your time travel trips you
were the Pleiadians made it possible for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to go visit Emmanuel and who was
Emmanuel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he a man just like us or what did they
tell you about him?
[SPEAKER_01]: About whom?
Emmanuel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emmanuel he was a man like us he was
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they have did the Pleiadians were they
involved somehow with Emmanuel's life?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time Emmanuel was here did the
Pleiadians were they involved with him did
[SPEAKER_01]: they talk to him or help them was there
any contact with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes they was connected to him they was
working with him together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did he tell you about?
[SPEAKER_00]: They was they was working on the same
mission as today together with Emmanuel
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was working on the same mission
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mission goes back to the year 389,000
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the Pleiadians have a special message
for us or why are they contacting us
[SPEAKER_01]: through you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The special message the special message we
have from the Pleiadians we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: written in our books there are about
10,000 pages and the most important point
[SPEAKER_00]: of this message is this to teach the Urk
people to the right way back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: creation and the creation laws to live
with them and for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the movie they usually portray
extraterrestrials as monsters or dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: or using their ships to you know harm us
do you think we should is there any fear
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Pleiadians?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could tell us something about
the creational laws you talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: creation but what what is the laws of
creation what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The creation laws the mostly of them you
can find out in the free nature if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the animals the plants the
flowers the trees the whole life who is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the free nature there you can
find out the laws of the creation what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the true how it is working how is going on
everything on the right free and lawful
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the laws you can find out through
meditation through initiation through your
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling and through your own thinking and
if you get a clear hearing clear feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: what you need in the meditation to clear
seeing and everything like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that every spirit that
comes into this planet does not have
[SPEAKER_01]: accidents that they come in physically
prepared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each spirit form who goes into a body of a
human being if comes a woman pregnant
[SPEAKER_00]: is completely by good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spirit themselves or the spirit form
how you like to say is not able to come
[SPEAKER_00]: ill to come sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the body of the of the baby of each
life form has the right to be absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: uninsured on body and spirit and mind and
everything when it comes to this world or
[SPEAKER_00]: each other world in the space out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No they don't use money they have other
system they work two hours a day and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a check card and if they was working
these two hours a day everywhere they want
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have a special place where they
have to stay and to work they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world everywhere to work where
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this check card will be checked by a
robot by a machine and then they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they use and they like for
living or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have big cities like here on Mars?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have big cities not on the same size
like our cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are separated what you call the
houses in the city of Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the buildings in the city they are like
a square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the room the space inside is free for
plants and trees and flowers or for siesta
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this each building the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what shall I say for this kind of life
what they are having there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in each building there is just one
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a maximum of five persons the parents
and three children and not more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also do they have marriage like we
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have marriage but how they do the
marriage I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't any idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only know there are the spirit leaders
or the spirit leaders who put together or
[SPEAKER_00]: bring together men and wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally a man has between one and
four wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else as we have here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible for the women to also have
many husbands?
[SPEAKER_01]: No they have one husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: At last somebody got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other buildings the other houses they
have they are outside of cities and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are separated in squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: In squares by one hundred to one hundred
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there inside is always one house only
for one family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they live longer than we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah they are around about one thousand
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that because of medical advances or
sciences?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the old Lurians and the old vegans
they had a very high life time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the Gemüt and how do we learn
to work with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Gemüt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the spiritual part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gemüt is the spiritual part of that
what we have in the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the counterpart to the psyche on
the material side of the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a sensor or something
you said that connects us to creation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the Gemüt is in the spiritual
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing what we have of psyche in
the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material part in the physical body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gemüt is working on the same wise as
the psyche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together with wisdom and the feeling of
the spirit like the psyche in the material
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the thinking and the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I know people are curious about
is why we're born either a man or a woman
[SPEAKER_01]: and do we go back and forth and if you are
a woman do you stay a woman for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time or does it go back and forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: No you can't change this from lifetime to
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stay in this life you are a man
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you like to be a woman at the next
lifetime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next reincarnation or next incarnation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to program yourself,
your mind, your we have again the word
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a free line to be at next time a
woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have control over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have control over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you not are clear working you don't
know really want you now be a man or a
[SPEAKER_00]: woman then it will be a little bit wrong
at the next lifetime because then you will
[SPEAKER_00]: be a homosexual man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you not know what you will be really if
a woman or if a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you must make the decision with clear
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you leave this life without clear
thinking and you are confused if to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: man or a woman then maybe you will come
back homosexual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you make the decision on the other side
to be a man or a woman or it must be first
[SPEAKER_01]: in the material life?
[SPEAKER_00]: These you already have in your mind in the
material life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will sit in the material life the
direct line to be that or that in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: About homosexuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is other kind of homosexuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is made out of a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a sickness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both you can change through teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are teaching such people who is
homosexual you can help them maybe by what
[SPEAKER_00]: do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help them with their thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone is homosexual this lifetime
then you can help them get their thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: clear and the next time they will not be
homosexual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it is possible to change it in
this life that they come to real good
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking and feelings and they can change
in this life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible to if you choose next
lifetime not to be physical can you get
[SPEAKER_01]: into what they call light body?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that is absolutely impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human being from the beginning from
the earliest beginning to that point when
[SPEAKER_00]: he comes to a light body or a spirit body
how we say it takes between 60 and 80
[SPEAKER_00]: billion years with several thousands or
billions of incarnations or reincarnations
[SPEAKER_00]: how you ever would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely impossible to have three
incarnations or one thousand incarnations
[SPEAKER_00]: on this earth and then you will be so
clever to get out of your body to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: light body or a spirit body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earliest point you need will be by 60
billion years.
[SPEAKER_00]: With several billions or millions of
incarnations or reincarnations.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we evolve into a light body and past
that we evolve back into creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that the... This takes a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that the central core of
the universe the central sun is that
[SPEAKER_01]: spirit forms things that used to be spirit
forms and now evolved into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The central form or the central sun what
you ever will say that the creation spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: the going out of everything from our
universe and of every life form and there
[SPEAKER_00]: we will go back one time very far in the
future if you are in our evolution so high
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to get the connection with that
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are if we as human live or lose
our bodies and grows up to a light form or
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit form the first step what I told you
between 60 and 80 billion years then are
[SPEAKER_00]: all the levels with several trillion years
quadrillion years it goes higher and
[SPEAKER_00]: higher up up to the highest point and the
last one is the level of the Dalai before
[SPEAKER_00]: the creation herself and from the Dalai
level it's possible to get the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: highest body of spirit the finest body of
spirit to enter the creation herself to
[SPEAKER_00]: come once with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these things that we have called
emotions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anger, hate, jealousy, fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we born with those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a made out of the human being
himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes himself anger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes himself love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes himself everything what's falling
into emotion and motion have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled by the human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is giving out a point of evolution
not on that way that if you are angry goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill somebody or to hit somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emotions they are always on this kind of
like the human being then use or prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: always wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these emotions to use them on
this way that you start to control them
[SPEAKER_00]: and the best thing what's going out a
drizzle of them to use for yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: for your evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy there are many people that are
fascinated with the continent of Atlantis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a Pleiadian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the Pleiadians have something to do
with Atlantis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pleiadians have nothing to do with old
Atlantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old Lurians and Vegans had something
to do with Atlantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean some parts of the Lurians and
Vegans who had stations here on earth who
[SPEAKER_00]: was living here on earth but they got
troubled together and so and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed Atlantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through an Adonis this means a small or a
big asteroid they brought to earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed Atlantis with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a story Semyasi told us such a
story about Atlantis and what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all written in the contact notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that it was fascinating how it all
came to an end.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a city called Mu that they had
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mu I think was the capital city of the
enemies of the Atlantis people and Mu was
[SPEAKER_00]: how I know or I think in the Chinese
desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any people left from Atlantis or
Mu or any of them still here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There shall be some people left and they
shall live in underground cities near the
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalaya, India.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a bluish color on the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen at once in India three people
with bluish color and I think they came
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely normal in India to see
people with blue skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really speaking of colors in our galaxy
are there a lot of other human life just
[SPEAKER_01]: like us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some more than 42 million
different human races.
[SPEAKER_01]: With many different colors of skin I
suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some around about 340 or 350
different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are many of them visiting Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear many stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pleiadians they told me there will be
about 3,000 or something in flying to
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth's atmosphere each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: By UFOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most of them are such ones who are
exploring the Earth and also are they
[SPEAKER_00]: always the same races, the same people who
come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not many aliens who come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of course but not so many
how the people is spreading around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they seem to be landing every day in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the American Indian come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Indian was one of the first
three races who was created here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: How were we created on Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: How were we created?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the first man?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first creation of human this was what
shall I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Schleim.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what's a one celler?
[SPEAKER_00]: One cell like a single cell amoeba?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first human on Earth was starting as a
one celler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he came as a wobbling kind of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through out of them slowly slowly came
out and growed up the body of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it start in the ocean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the theory we came from apes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely idiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the apes come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: The apes they have the same thing like the
human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came after the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first was the flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flora had fallouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not radiative fallouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean fallouts of their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed themselves together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came out a new kind of living
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: One celler again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they growed up to more celler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came out slowly slowly fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the fish came later the apes
and other animals on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the fish was going on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came the land animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when happens this when was here
all the flora and the fauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plant life and the animal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the same way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put out some stuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you call Amino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put them together too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then was growing up slowly slowly the
human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not made out of the apes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of problems on Earth that we
all know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people think maybe the Pleiadians are
coming to solve our problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to help us in any way that
you know of?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't will help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single way they help us to bring the
teachings what they belong to our mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get informations or I got
informations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can write down them and then give
out to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing they help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They not come here to make peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They not come here to make war.
[SPEAKER_00]: They not have any ambitions to overtake
the Earth and the Earth human and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only feel them somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: about the four beers who have done trouble
here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they won't bring us back the
teaching, the spiritual teaching and the
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching about creation and creation and
law and right, life and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these teachings, if a person wants to
learn to evolve and for the initiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing what the human have to do
to begin to study through the meditation
[SPEAKER_00]: he has to listen to his inner voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to keep these things not failing the
inner voice and to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is learn to see to
hear, to feel, to speak on a very clear
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the meditation themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the meditation is done after some
years, if the meditation is coming clear
[SPEAKER_00]: and clear and good, then the human can go
a step higher and then he can do the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means he can begin to start to
talk with his inner voice, with his
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the spiritual part in him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still having contacts with
Semyasi?
[SPEAKER_00]: The contact with Semyasi ended on 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she left our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And left our universe to the doll
universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there she is now living for the next
70 or 72 years without any returning to
[SPEAKER_00]: our universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contacts with Semyasi, they are also
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still there is sporadic contact with
Da, with Quetzal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Semyasi have contacts with anybody
else while she was here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single contact Semyasi had all the
time she was on earth was with me only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do any of the other Pleiadians have
contacts with people on earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on a way that the contact person knows
that there is a contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people, there are between 24,000 and
25,000 people around the earth who get
[SPEAKER_00]: contact impulses from Pleiadian and Bavi
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavi is a rest who is working very old
time together with the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also 24,000, 25,000 people have
contact on impulse bus base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also they don't know anything about that
that they have contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact that they get impulses from
outside from aliens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not any one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was two other persons in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had telepathic contact to the
Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not by Semyasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some other people responsible
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two people, a man and a 16 year
old girl, they died in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an accident in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that, that these two
people had contact, telepathic contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Pleiadians was this because they
should come to inform the people about my
[SPEAKER_00]: mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That everything I'm bringing is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I'm working on this mission with
the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They was something like a proof for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they died by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm the single one who has
telepathic contact with the Pleiadians and
[SPEAKER_00]: physical contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is not any connection between
the Pleiadians and any other earth human
[SPEAKER_00]: being, if man, if child or if woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just really nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one who comes and say,
oh, I have contact with someone from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleiadians from that planet or from that
sun system from the Pleiadians and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all, what you say, swindle,
hoax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our favorite words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is around the world not any one
person more without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, what all they who say
that they have contact with the Pleiadians
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know is this, the Pleiad is what we
can see on the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not any possibility for human to
live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pleiadians what you can see on the
sky, they are too young as they can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planets, they are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so young.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no life possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too not by the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are too young.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing what all they who
say, oh, I have contact with Pleiadians
[SPEAKER_00]: not knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not one human being there up on
the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody home.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleiadians, the Pleiadians, they say that
they are coming from the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it is about that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a second part, a little part or
a short part of a second, different time
[SPEAKER_00]: out of our time, of our room and our
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A point where are the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: If here are the Pleiades, we can see on
the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are in other room space,
other planets, and they call them by the
[SPEAKER_00]: same names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call the Pleiades is what we can
see from here on the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in a other room time,
much more finer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than our room time and room space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their structure is much more finer as
our structure, as human being from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's impossible for them to make shake
hands with the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: On earth or only go near them because it's
very dangerous for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also are out of our room space,
out of our time space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not there where are our Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy, what is telepathy and can we
develop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Telepathy, that's a kind of hearing to
listen, but on a very, very fine way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the ears for this telepathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the primary telepathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the real telepathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real telepathy, the spiritual
telepathy in this goes on and is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: symbols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the primary telepathy is working on
words, on words and on pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a photography or something,
a body or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can produce in the other human
being through his ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through his consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we able to evolve far enough in this
life to be able to get into the Akashi
[SPEAKER_01]: records and to learn our personal keys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, maybe you could tell
us, what is the Akashi records?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Akashi records is, we call it,
we call it by other name, Cosmical
[SPEAKER_00]: Speicher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They record everything that's a label
around the sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be recorded everything what
is doing a human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he is thinking, what he is feeling,
what he is speaking, what he is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be there recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you die and return in a other
income, in incarnation, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: impulses from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get... And then you know
things, you know, you get results without
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing from where.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the made out of this Akashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you can find people,
but they are very, very few only.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use the Akashi records for
getting impulses out of there from other
[SPEAKER_00]: people, not from himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because his frequency is very near to them
of the other one, who he can get impulses
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe can be a drawer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a writer, or a company or something,
who get impulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, oh, that's Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had contact with Michelangelo,
but he hadn't contact with Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only get impulses out of the Akashi
records from that frequency, who had,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially what I told you, Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we learn to use the keys?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we learn what our keys are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the meditation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you will do on spiritual way or
on consciousness way is going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: meditation and initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we always talk about the word love?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to tell you in short way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a thing called love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is love.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is love, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not intellectual experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have the translated
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a short way to say what's the
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how to tell in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you ask Bruni, he can tell you,
he can translate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe we can kind of finish,
and if you have maybe just a message to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, about the information the
Pleiadians are bringing, maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: something you'd like to say to people
about, you know, a message from yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: about the mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something about how it might be
useful to information or how to learn to
[SPEAKER_01]: be 100% responsible for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just some reason why they should pay
attention to all the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each human being, what he is doing every
time, at day, at night, week by week,
[SPEAKER_00]: month by month, year by year, he is always
responsible for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a God.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a God who is responsible for
the human doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not angels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not holy people who is caring for
the human being, the responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human being always is responsible for
everything for himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, this can be short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years ago, Wendell Stevens,
I think, made a model when you were taking
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the pictures are floating
around America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could just, a short question,
why they made the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was made two models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Wendell Stevens and Lee Elders
and Tom Welsh got them by a student for
[SPEAKER_00]: each $400, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought them to
[SPEAKER_00]: here when we were filming for the movie
Contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tried to make some of these
models flying by a stick and a string.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all filmed by this movie
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the models I got for myself as
a present, as a souvenir, and this I still
[SPEAKER_00]: have in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is just one last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you explain the role of the Viggo?
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of the Viggo is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to correct everything what I'm
writing down, to clear off it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then to print, to make books,
and to bring out them to the people all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: To, with the mission to teach the people
in the creation laws, and with everything
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens around,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to do a hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to learn by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to study themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to meditate to make initiation
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to learn who are they really,
and what they have to do in this life
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be, here, for all the
people who is interested in the mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing, our Viggo
members, the mostly of our Viggo members,
[SPEAKER_00]: are belonging to the old Lurians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are staying under a codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have fixed up several thousand
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stay now under this codex,
and for this codex, they have sworn at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, they have to work for it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not only with, our people here
in Hinterschmidruthi, in the Semjade
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver Star Center, the same will be in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have the same in Japan,
or in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to fulfill their mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they were saying for it they will do
in some 380 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only need one other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only need like 20 seconds of just
quietness though, in case we need to put
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Bill, that was real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of good things that we can use
in there, that would be really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the best thing what you can do,
you translate everything and read it in
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much easier when everybody read
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's coming to that eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you study the German language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that may be a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many people, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five seconds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what do you like to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can ask questions all night with you.
Okay.
Thank you.
