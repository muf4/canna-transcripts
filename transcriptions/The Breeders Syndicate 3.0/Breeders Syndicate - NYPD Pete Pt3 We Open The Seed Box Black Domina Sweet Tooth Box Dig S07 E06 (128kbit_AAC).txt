[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_05]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_05]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_05]: Notzodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_05]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We join this conversation already in
progress and it kind of ends abruptly too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, dude, how you been?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, it's a little bit earlier for you
guys there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notzodon, you look like you just got out
of bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Matt just told me,
but I've been up since six days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the fucking deal is.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's lying, he's rolled out of bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hit record and I figure we're just
going to have a conversation and just like
[SPEAKER_05]: go through seeds and just see where it
leads us on conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I kind of split the seeds while
you can record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you recording now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to do your intro thing or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just wander into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did kind of go through the seeds and
I figured there was certain ones you might
[SPEAKER_01]: be interested in, there's certain ones you
probably don't really care much about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, again, I never classified
myself as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for a couple little projects I did
for myself where I was looking for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics for myself and for my
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also in turn for the general
public because I honestly think they would
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from what I was chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the genetics, even the stuff I
found is just somebody who's in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: they brought back a few packs of this,
a few packs of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew them out, cross-bred, put F1s out
on the market for, I think it was six
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent you some of those catalogs,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, those are so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only 16 or 25 bucks or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of, and I'll send you some
more stuff like Chris, who was the founder
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Great Canada Hemp Forum and Hemp
Nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, one of the earlier, I go out
there and say, I think the first seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada that openly sold seeds on the
market kind of thing, even though it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just through retail and our website or his
website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, we're going to go
back to like 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything had to be, we didn't have any
kind of this Wix or everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing an entire website through raw
code.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite the process to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it's pretty nice to,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95 is early.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95 is early for HTML.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and this, again,
this is going to bring up what we spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: about the very first time we spoke because
I called my Black Domina 95, my Widow 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started looking into it with
Shawnee Kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just like, no, Widow,
Domina didn't come out till 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, that's fucked up that I
would mislabel that because I've literally
[SPEAKER_01]: been calling that since 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I talked to Chris about it and I
was like, this is a seed catalog that I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember it in what was on the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to pull out one of the
old Hemp Nation seed menus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in, this was from May of 96.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which means I would have bought those
seeds and sprouted them most likely in
[SPEAKER_01]: late 95 in order to grow them out enough
to reproduce them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what would happen often?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is they would release new lines in and
around the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was back then in, you know,
the last week of November.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like there could be a thing where
you're like, oh, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it in 95.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was released on November 27th,
1995.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it literally came out like a month
before the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 95 catalog.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we found the catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the website says 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was thinking about that also
because most of the people traveling from
[SPEAKER_01]: here to Amsterdam were going for the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when they're buying all the
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would have brought the seed back
to us in, like you say, early December,
[SPEAKER_01]: 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like in the Jack Herrera for
instance, I mean, obviously like 95,
[SPEAKER_06]: they had that whole themed cup based on
him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did the worldwide release of the Jack
Herrera line at the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was, it was one of those times like
for the Dutch or whatever, where you could
[SPEAKER_06]: get a lot of free publicity.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was already all the cameramen,
you know, and all the ad guys and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that were going to write stories
were already there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd get a lot of free press on the
new new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of viewed it as like that was at
least in the 90s era, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: traditional for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then on top of that too,
maybe they had a line that was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: that was about to come out, but they enter
it into the cup and then it would win
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the seeds would be immediately
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd see those like super glossy,
multi-page centerfolds and high times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was all about driving interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a business and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it kind of, this kind of
brings me to my, my other topic before we
[SPEAKER_01]: really get into the, the bag of beans here
is, you know, I was talking with Matt too,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I had some, some friends reach out
and kind of question some of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was, the way I was remembering
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so it got me thinking about
that, the BD 95, I was like, I swear it's
[SPEAKER_01]: 95 and it took me months, you know,
for, for Chris to dig out some of our old
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp nation stuff to see, well,
no, here's the BD on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and what I was trying to explain to,
you know, people that have questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: how some of us recall certain stories or
certain events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think not, so you talked about this
a few times in the past where a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people were like secretive and they didn't
want to share the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was people like me that
wanted to share the stories, don't mind
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody remembers it differently,
then at least here we're giving them a
[SPEAKER_01]: platform or we're giving, I'm trying to
invoke the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't text me on my cell phone
and say, Hey, listen, what you said was
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if that's the case, then correct
me and I'll come online or whenever I talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to anybody in newspaper, magazine,
whatever, I'll correct it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can only regurgitate how I remember
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, you know, if I mispronounce
somebody's name or I have a date wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, like the story that we would
be talking about last time with the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that we used in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I was asking if you guys
know anybody that was working with Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: back then that could collaborate or
confirm that, uh, that story would be
[SPEAKER_01]: great because this is what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what, if I misspeak or
something like that, there's, when you air
[SPEAKER_01]: this, there's a whole bunch of comments
people can comment, correct us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that you can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain things don't get upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it did, you know,
I didn't have a riff, uh, for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, get established because of this,
but it did bring up some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, conversation.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they got a heated conversation,
but it got like, no, no, that's not how it
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then tell me how you remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you how I remember it and we can
get it out there kind of Matt and I deal
[SPEAKER_06]: with this all the time and it's,
it is a good, it is a good time to chat
[SPEAKER_06]: about it because we're always open to like
someone remembering something different or
[SPEAKER_06]: new information comes to light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the time we talk, it's more like,
this is the best that we know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And memories are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Memories, memories are funny things,
you know, and we'd like to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The memories are etched in stone and stuff
like that, but you know, like they're just
[SPEAKER_06]: not right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you start thinking back to like,
um, 25, 30 years ago or even 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what, what's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and that, and that, that's definitely
part of it because I mean, we have,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's certain stories where it's like,
people get all upset about, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: one camper or another, but the fact of the
matter is, is there was two or three guys
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't agree on all parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they don't agree on all parts and
they were indisputably the people
[SPEAKER_06]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does the rest of you figure out which,
which tale you want to believe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it festers in us, like,
you know, the story, and I've regurgitated
[SPEAKER_01]: stories numerous times, hence why I wrote
a book because I put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody does remember something
different, like, you know, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in print now, but yeah, I had this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 20, 30 years prior to, and this is how
it's always been told kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I, I put it as special
with cannabis because listen, when we get
[SPEAKER_01]: super high and we have conversations or
events happen, sometimes we might not
[SPEAKER_01]: remember them that well period,
let alone correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, we look at our elders,
elders that before the internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: before newspapers, papers before,
you know, magazines before we would,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there was just elder sitting in
circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did went to a rainbow gatherings
with the, uh, the camp we stayed with was
[SPEAKER_01]: granola funk and they would set up a stage
and it's the rainbow gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no newspapers going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, if you wanted to learn the history
of the rainbow trail, you go to granola
[SPEAKER_01]: funk every night at six o'clock or eight o
'clock and there'd be a stage set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is built from, you know,
uh, logs we find on the trees,
[SPEAKER_01]: we find on the ground and, uh,
the elders would tell the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabis, because it was so
secretive because of the laws being so,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, part of who said what,
yeah, it became secretive and the stories
[SPEAKER_01]: do get muffled and the stories do get,
um, uh, jumbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I invite people to post stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hear something you, I,
or somebody else says, even if it's at
[SPEAKER_01]: another podcast or you write it in a,
uh, a magazine article, if you have two
[SPEAKER_01]: cents at it, because everybody's two cents
will add up to a dollar someday.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of look at it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, uh, you know, that whole vibe that
you just, that you were just, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking of is kind of the way we look at
things where like, it's basically just
[SPEAKER_06]: like, it's like a lot of these chats and
stuff or conversation starters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we absolutely welcome like more info
or differing points of view or tidbits
[SPEAKER_06]: that get added, like add that get weaved
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that like the people that get
really huffy about it, um, generally are
[SPEAKER_06]: the ones where like they're making money
off their reputation or they're selling
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds or they get locked into one
particular historical tale that suits
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they end up having to defend that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's, you know,
I think there's a lot of damage done in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry because like you're saying,
when it comes business, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and business interferes with friendships,
which has happened numerous times in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in this, the movement again,
that got developed by the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really close friends that were
part of the very beginning of this that do
[SPEAKER_01]: speak out when the right time comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them are just, you know,
a lot of them are weathered by this,
[SPEAKER_01]: by this industry now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a shitload of heat when I
joined in diva, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when I was in diva with, with these two
business suits, fucking shiny shoe
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfuckers that, you know, people were
like, oh, you're selling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're selling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it selling out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am going to get paid quite,
quite well, but what else am I supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're not happy with the
direction that the ship is going from the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidelines means jack shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you're not making a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the fucking boat and help steer it
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just bitching from the
sidelines, sorry, I don't, I don't fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: got any time for you kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get on the fucking boat and, and correct
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and help us steer it into the fucking
direction that you believe it should be
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because some of these people are all
deep friends of mine, I invite that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would love for them to come together,
even though I know some of them can't
[SPEAKER_01]: because of outside of this, uh,
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that, that weld will never,
will never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, we need to kind of keep this,
these stories, this journey alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way we can do it is if the
elders regurgitate how they understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, there's a lot of elders
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to Doc Sumac, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Roddy heading, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote one of the first grow guides,
grow your own stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, grow your own stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super fucking nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super freaky motherfucker, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Still not in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the hemp and you know,
still, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would sit and just listen to
him, you know, I wanted to hear his
[SPEAKER_01]: version from the fifties and the state or
the sixties and the seventies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is nothing like he,
he wrote it and grow your own stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: High times was out, uh, in the,
in the seventies and some stories got out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not now today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fucking podcasters in there's
websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much out there that we could,
you know, fill in all these blanks and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, maybe I am wrong in some of the
stories because that's just, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: how I remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please correct me if, uh, if I'm
misunderstanding the.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the balls to be wrong and to
stand up and like, you know, remember
[SPEAKER_05]: something wrong and then take
accountability.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't even have the balls
to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just like to point and judge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they would stand up too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really my end of things,
but Matt, Matt, Matt loves like,
[SPEAKER_06]: like murder shows and murder mysteries and
all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that they've
discovered is one of the absolute worst
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of testimony is eyewitness
testimony, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the memory is so funny and it can,
and it can change over time and it can be
[SPEAKER_06]: influenced over time and you can be
convinced and have your memory change.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other part of it that's important
for people to realize is that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, when, you know, this might sound
a little grandiose or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you're involved in any kind of like
interesting thing in history, most people
[SPEAKER_06]: don't read it and they don't realize
they're involved in it at the time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nobody re we didn't realize when we
were all younger, messing around with this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that people were going to want to
know granular details of some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and that, that plays a role too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like we all knew that,
Hey, we should really document this as
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, as you were saying with the,
with the underground nature of things,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, notes were a bust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went opposite and you kept a million
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always kept notes and I recorded things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was involved, there was really
good notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wasn't involved and I, it's just,
I'm going by, uh, what I've seen and what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's part of, uh, part of law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, you want to, you know,
you want to ice the goalie kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want to prolong how long till
you put a witness on the stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the defense, because you want
that person's memory to get foggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that person's memory to maybe be
influenced by other things or.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, remember the gist of the story,
but maybe not the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you say, like all these stories
we have are little grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the longest time we were playing
in a, in a, in a small sandbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're on, we're on beaches of endless
grains of sand where there's so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many people involved that,
you know, the few of us that were sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: in that little sandbox, we only remember
so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going back to the, uh,
for me, the eighties, I started growing
[SPEAKER_01]: pop in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk about that too, all the time where
it was like, I kind of feel like,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least for like America for a,
for a while there, like hippies and the
[SPEAKER_06]: grateful dead and that kind of highway,
it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the primary path in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not any, it's not anymore,
but for an era there, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, hippie circles and groups
of friends and, and all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of that, people don't
realize that like, you could go meet
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody on dead tour and chat and you
were somewhat anonymous because they
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't know where you lived.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't know who you were really.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't from your hometown.
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't going to get rated
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people would bring their weed on
the, on the tour and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like there, there's, you know,
now it's like you, as you were saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: like weeds, a super highway and like,
that's just one lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a bunch of other lanes
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the grateful dead thing too,
like the, the shakedown street was where
[SPEAKER_01]: the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the elders sat and told the
stories to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a lot of us out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I wasn't on dead tour, but you know,
obviously lots of good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only would I, when I did my travels up
and down the East coast, I didn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought the seed too, because for me,
I like this, this type of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and this seed grows this type of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, crossing international lines or on
dead tour, chances of DA or anybody like
[SPEAKER_01]: that infiltrating shakedown or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to travel with fucking
large amounts of pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you, you find somebody that's
like, like minded that has good pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: has the right vibe or the right stories,
you pass that seed along to that person
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, Hey, listen, when we have dead
comes through here next year, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: call you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to, you, we're going to
find each other, you know, bring me some
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, you know, and you can spread that
seed and give me some of your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if when you're in Buffalo or something
like that, or you're in Orlando,
[SPEAKER_01]: look me up, I'll be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do that not only just for the story,
but for the, for the ability for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: share in genetics, but also not,
you know, for a safety reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost basically to, you know,
pass out cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I went through a phase where I was
like, I don't want anybody to really have
[SPEAKER_01]: my cuttings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little worried about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about that with the
moms I had at the end of my mom garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was somewhere close to 150 moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot over at least a hundred of
them I had for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and probably 30 of them I've had
for decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I've kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always like, yeah, you know,
and there's something else I think I sent
[SPEAKER_01]: you in a, in a private message was,
you know, when I was doing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I don't really want to have anybody
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, they're going to bastardize
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to kill the name, shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then my, that I'd lost that mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was like, okay, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this guy, Yoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give him my genetics,
you know, and he keeps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep, I keep two of every fucking plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means, and when I have 130,
150 plants, that means I have 300 moms,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just flowering 300 moms about your
numbers and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so what I started doing was I would
give them out to different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, what I did learn also is never
tell, you know, grower a that you gave it
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow a B as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower B is like, well, you gave it to
grow a, so I just killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have space, didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm just totally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower a fucking just did the same fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have that fucking string.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lost like, I lost my chemo from 96
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, and I found some chemo
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know which ones they
are, the UBC, or again, I think there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: Ottawa cut again, called chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the fucking chemo?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in our seed fucking catalog,
there's a story that the chemo was
[SPEAKER_01]: developed to fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in, I think they said Ontario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, where the fuck that story
come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written in the hemp nation fucking,
um, uh, catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I did hear about G 13,
you know, I heard, you know, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: certain medical strains being grown in
California that made it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and then the whole like M
39, that whole list of VMs and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's people out there that know
the, the truth of where this came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could have been like my purple
power plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: My purple power plant is not a power
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purple power plant because it was a
cutting given to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No guy had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old time farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not smoking this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been growing for the last fucking 20
years, the 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew just like a power plant structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking went purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I call it a triple P, purple power
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like, oh yeah, I love power plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, this isn't power plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at least I'm, I'll be honest about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just named it this because it fit the
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy for me to remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the PPP that went around Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there was, cause there was a PPP
that went around that people called like
[SPEAKER_05]: pure power plant, purple power plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might've like, I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I named that probably 12, at least 12
years ago, probably more maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was longer than us before I was
married.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably 15 years ago, you know,
and it was, again, at this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I was spreading the wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and my members, all my members
at the London compassionate society have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to all my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't pull them back from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they wanted it or they ended up with
it, um, whoever they gave it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, good on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily some, I got some strains back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I was just like, ah, you know,
we lost it, put it on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, were you growing this strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, I wasn't, but I gave it to
my brother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can ask him, he still has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, you know, the whole thing about
keeping our seas protected and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, and like, again,
when we get into the seeds here,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we probably should soon is,
um, I want, I, you know, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: piss people off, but I want to see
genetics, um, rescued.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of these people don't have
these genetics, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as a, as a collector myself,
like the hardest thing, it's really easy
[SPEAKER_06]: to spread things out when like they're
having their moment in the sun and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: popular and people can make money off
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hard part is like, Hey, I'm going to
give you this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it in your mom room, even when it's
unpopular and it's maybe just headstache
[SPEAKER_06]: for you and nobody else wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause everybody wants it when it's had,
has its moment in the sun and it's popular
[SPEAKER_06]: and they can sell it and they can do stuff
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, who's going to hold onto it
when it's just unpopular and kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: pain in the ass and taking up space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's the weird thing is everybody
wants someone else to do that work so that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's available to them when they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do it a little bit different
again, because of the amount of clients
[SPEAKER_01]: that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would sit with my staff and say,
okay, um, this is what's in the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's on coming next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would have to figure out,
okay, well, this strain is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: popular sellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to grow it every other harvest or
every third harvest, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: many, uh, lights we were going to dedicate
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would have to, you know,
especially with, you know, I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, we keep at least 25 to 30 strains on
our menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we produce all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would have to predict when that
strain we think is going to get down low
[SPEAKER_01]: enough that we never run out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have to predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had literally almost two years of,
um, of a list of what I was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing because I had to, so we didn't run
out of it on our menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did keep all those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, it's not like,
I'm you, it's not like, okay, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't just say, I'm going to grow a
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to pull out the mom or moms get big
enough to take the cuttings off of them
[SPEAKER_01]: and have the cuttings ready for when the
time comes to flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can have the harvest in by this
particular date, which is four and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means in about a year or in six,
in 14 months, I have to start the taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuttings out in the mom room,
put them into the veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually one of the big problems that
we have right now and like how they
[SPEAKER_06]: arrange to like California legal market is
that you, most people like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the nursery and the cultivation for flower
is separate, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're separate, they're separate
businesses or licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like a nursery might have a hundred
plants, you know, that they're,
[SPEAKER_06]: that they have in their, in their
collection, but they only pick eight or
[SPEAKER_06]: nine to like, have that many moms to offer
up that season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's like actually like quite
limiting because they're trying to plan it
[SPEAKER_06]: and like, you can be like, Oh,
I want to grow this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But man, like the nurseries that I want,
they didn't choose that one to market this
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't, I can't get enough of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore it can't go in my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore it's not going to hit the
menu anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that was an issue also,
like you're saying with what's,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the new phase, what's hot on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to keep that into consideration
with the center as well, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, well, you know, the,
um, the poop breath is, uh, is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is huge right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's asking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, okay, well, you know, let's see if we
can find a cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get a cutting, but that means it's
not going to be on our menu for six
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it going to be popular by the time
you mom it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just like, so for me, I was like,
what, what is our staple?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will keep a certain amount of
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available for what's new or what,
you know, that's going to be a tester,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we'll grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take, you know, um,
minimum four months, four to five months
[SPEAKER_01]: to get an okay harvest where we can put it
out there to the, to our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they could say, yeah,
this is a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're like, okay, we're going to
throw it in the next rotation because we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new, it's fresh, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be another, three months
until we can have it, um, on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, and if it's not, you know,
we have another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was kind of a, it was a,
it was quite the chess game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't miss it at all, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, it was a, uh,
it was a hard way to grow when it's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not growing for the magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not growing for the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine and you're growing and you're
growing for, I think we're with 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: clients or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, not all of them use, uh,
use us, uh, like we would like them to,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I guess in a sense, but supplying that
many, uh, clients on a regular basis would
[SPEAKER_01]: be close to impossible going into,
you know, um, darker markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but anyways, um, so yeah, I get back
to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what we kind of wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, we're going to talk on an
offline, I think about some of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this stuff, because, you know,
you were going to hear names that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: that the original breeders of these
strains are definitely going to want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will get that they're not going to
get my seed, but I would like to see if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can resurrect these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could save these seeds, they're top
on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get, uh, any of the seed,
if there's any males or females that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to, that I will have access
to, then the original breeders of these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains get those cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the, um, the males, females,
and I would like to do an open pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: just to save the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's going to be a smorgasbord of
God knows everything's in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if there's a hundred seeds,
if there's a thousand seeds that what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking for is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it comes from any of the cuts,
any of the, sorry, the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: male or female that come from it,
100% every, uh, every breeder gets those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not in the seed business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to sell their strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to save their strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I know some of them say,
well, just send me the original seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, they're my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make, I want to say,
I want to make sure they're going to who I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel is capable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because my seeds are old and they
weren't stored properly, chances are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I spoke to some of them
already, they're like, yeah, don't worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about the fucking, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them were like, Oh,
did you store them properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, they're not overly
interested anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them, um, as we spoke
privately, privately are willing to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, send people to come talk to me
about getting their genetics back kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to leave these people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the focus for this, but these are
seeds that, um, that I own the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't own the strain and I want to make
sure the genetic gets back to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, who it rightfully belongs to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I mean, the fun, the funny part about
that is some people might not even be
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in getting them because they
wouldn't want to ever admit that they
[SPEAKER_06]: needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of them will admit to need it,
but they're just like, Pete, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: that back then, you know, it's nothing
compared to what we're producing today.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like when people offer me my old
stuff, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, well, you know, 15 years ago,
I was doing something totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really into what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now go ahead and run with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, but again, I'll give them
that, uh, that offer because I was more
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioning that like some seed banks are
like, well, we have all the original
[SPEAKER_06]: parents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know some of these guys don't
have any of these seeds and haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: for probably decade or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't even part of their breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, it wasn't part of their
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them or some of it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have four seeds like the chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I only have like four or four or
five seeds and little tiny seeds kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that doesn't belong to
anybody that I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody says, Oh, I developed
that, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking hit me up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I get seeds, I'll send you a fucking,
I'll send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an issue with that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to kind of back it up a
little bit, but yeah, you need to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, you know, I know who they are,
you know, I thought about it too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I was starting in Diva and I
was like, listen, I'm bringing all my
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and I have 15 years of data that
I've collected on the medical uses of
[SPEAKER_01]: these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown in the method that I grow them
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps me or was planned to help
me a lot with getting into the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: medical market where we can't advertise
that this strain works for this medical
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's kind of a loophole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that if you have testimony from
somebody that has the same illness or
[SPEAKER_01]: ailment as you and uses this strain,
you know, 80% of the time, they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is their go to Indica and this is
their go to Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can give you that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can say it works for your condition,
but if I have 15 years of data and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: say, listen, you know, out of the 80,
80 clients that have the same condition as
[SPEAKER_01]: you over the last 10 years, they 80% or
60% of the time they went to this and then
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% they went to this and then 20% they
went to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives them a starting point at least
to have a genetic that, um, that works for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm getting to is these genetics
don't belong to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants belong to me, but the genetics
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I bring in, in a genetic from,
you know, if it was some sensei seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the, you know, the big Amsterdam
companies, I don't give a fuck honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's one of the, you know,
what I call the old, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, from the movement in this area in
North America, you know, I would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not ask permission more or less
saying, what can I do, uh, to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, give you a piece kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it is something that, you know,
that I'm going to be using my strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach out to the strawberry diesel
guy and say, listen, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing the strain for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're going to grow it in the LP
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to see your strain
on the leave of market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what can I give you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be reasonable kind of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it, if it's a big seller and we're
making lots of money off it, sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: the wealth, because I'm the one on the
boat helping steer the ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're part of the, you're one of
the paddlers in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can screw anybody, but I'm also here to
not here to, you know, bend over and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, you know, yeah, it's your strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm using it for medicinal reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree if, you know, I, you know,
like what buddy did to Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, in Amsterdam where he takes Steve's
sweet tooth and, and enters the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell Steve to fuck himself pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like co-op this whole strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, see politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's one of those things where it's
you with the way seeds work and the way
[SPEAKER_06]: clones and everything else work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you can hoard it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or then once you let it out into the,
into the world, it's kind of the honor
[SPEAKER_06]: system from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I, I've had no problem,
uh, keeping track of some of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that gave me their, these genetics,
you know, and, um, I would piece them out
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow, you know, whether it be,
uh, like in these, this case here with the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, if I get any, uh, plants from these
seeds, they 100% get, if they want 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: get whatever they want from it,
they won't get all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get the exclusivity
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but if they say, well,
listen, Pete, you know, I don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see my seed out there being sold
on, on a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm here to save the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it'd be kind of dumb to,
uh, hoard stuff like that, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're talking about strains from
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they didn't care that much
now, but now they think it's a money
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money, you know, is maybe dictating with
some and some it's, it's the respect
[SPEAKER_01]: because they deserve so much, like tons of
respect in this, in this, uh, industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're from the movement and they
kind of got, you know, left on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wayside, whether it be their fault or not
their fault, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of us tried to get in and just
tied our, our, uh, align to the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that boat sank or went fucking south
like they did within diva.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I gave fucking my, uh,
my name, luckily not my genetics to a
[SPEAKER_01]: diva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, once they raised their fucking
$45 million, they were like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't really need you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, fucking kick me off the boat kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that happen so often.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many good people and it
deserves so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you see in California, California is
getting killed right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened in college.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happened basically in almost every
legal, every place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like my, my home state, New York,
my friends are like, let's get in,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like New York, New York is fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fucking mass money,
you know, and you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the, uh, the assholes,
um, up in Canada, we had canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that was going around bullying and
pushing around everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big, um, one of the states,
I think they might've started in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: or California and they opened up a shop in
New York, just waiting for the license,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they had enough money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't sell pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: A leaf maybe, or, uh, it's a really common
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Acreage holdings perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're old.
Devils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, I'll try to remember who it
was, but I know they had, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a flagship in New York, in Manhattan,
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before New York was even talking
about what would you need to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went in and, uh, um, opened up
shop selling fucking, uh, T-shirts and
[SPEAKER_01]: hats, I think, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what else they could
have sold at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to Google at the same
time that I talk to you guys, but,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, if we start getting into the politics
of how it goes state by state,
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll really get off subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I know like when I was out in
Colorado, right after they legalized and
[SPEAKER_01]: back then, obviously they couldn't use
banks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was getting paid like their
CEO that we met with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she helped actually write a lot of
the, uh, the bills for other states
[SPEAKER_01]: because everybody's trying to follow in
Colorado, uh, in their footsteps kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, she would get paid in a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had to go to a cash check.
[SPEAKER_01]: In place, she's probably making a couple
hundred grand a year and go into a check,
[SPEAKER_01]: cash and cash in place to cash your check
because you can't bring it to a bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like no federally insured place,
you know, or trying to get paid cash,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple hundred grand a year in cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're a CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a fucking hot head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking, you're brought in for your
business, uh, mind, not for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: mind kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still a big issue in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's going to be the biggest
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our biggest LP up here being Canopy,
which was, uh, um, Tweed, it started as
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweed, now it's Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was rumor that they were going to
think, or were thinking about starting
[SPEAKER_01]: their own bank because they had,
they were worth hundreds of millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, if not, you know, half a billion
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other companies like Indiva,
we're getting kicked out of banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had, you know, millions of dollars in
there and they're like, yeah, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come and get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got kicked out of, I've been kicked out
of three banks now in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been denied, uh,
mortgages when I put up three times what
[SPEAKER_01]: the mortgage was for in, in assets,
but because of what I did for a living,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it was fully legal and it was
a publicly traded company, the bank
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't touch me because you know,
reputational risk kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I know we're getting way off
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what do you want to start with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, just wherever you grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's going to be, there's going
to be stuff that I think is interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to be, be stuff
that, uh, um, um, might be interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came up, it's going to be kind of
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even get to see the names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to see the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Cream Sautica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a seed that we did in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Steve brought it in from this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this guy's name was started with a
J his name is Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a douche bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw he lives on sunshine coast now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I don't think it came from him,
but it came through a mutual friend whose
[SPEAKER_01]: name is a color and it's the red color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I think that's where this seed
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I brought these back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring these back from
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I ended up maybe getting these
after Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up, uh, working on a greenhouse
farm in the interior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, North of Kamloops that the guy that
was growing the Cream Sautica most likely
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me these beans kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look good, but this is,
this might be a strain that could be of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to some, not to the, cause I
wouldn't, I wouldn't even give it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy that would have made these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't give a fuck about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't give a fuck about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I'd be into that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like I said, we'll figure out a
whole bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so now we were talking about mighty
Mike, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so these seeds here from,
uh, from May, 2002, there are Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: cross mighty Mike being in Southwestern
Ontario, where we're like, we're saying we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get our stuff in out of the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mid-September possible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the cold, the frost and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we were, and this is from Yoda,
uh, who's still like, I just mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: before somebody I'd give some of my
genetics to hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is his breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now his breeding wasn't super specific or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, you know, I got a mighty
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cross it with a whole bunch
of shit because I want to speed up now
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing with the Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hindu Kush, which is also a fairly
fast strain, faster strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making us, and this is going to O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have the Kush craze by that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe for a second, you could talk about
mighty Mike because while Matt and I might
[SPEAKER_06]: be real familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people, especially in the U S and
stuff, it probably predates them and they
[SPEAKER_06]: probably have maybe heard about it,
but don't know very much about why it was
[SPEAKER_06]: popular or why it became such a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think it's basically what I was
just saying too, is because these strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that were fast, you know, and we didn't
want the ruderalis crap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was crap, but the, uh,
the fact that, you know, could clone it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with mighty Mike, uh,
it was a very easily clonable plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because of its structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most importantly, for us, it's,
we need things that finish quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to, we would use that in our,
um, I'm going to say breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in our seed making, we were looking
for these, um, uh, early, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ideally early September strain before the
thieves get out there, before the police
[SPEAKER_01]: get out there and before the frost comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, as far as the history goes in
mighty Matt, I that's, I leave that a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more to the experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were just, but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got, it got famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically because it came in, in the
season that was appropriate for where you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same thing with that golden
boy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a string called Boris, which was a,
um, and I just saw that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like AK 47 golden boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have that strain, but I want
to find out the lineage on this golden
[SPEAKER_01]: boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, story I was told, and I ran this
by HB, um, about, you know, because it
[SPEAKER_01]: really, that was our, that worked in a
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty sure it came through one of
his connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when this whole triple SC,
uh, name was, was, was attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was attached to it coming out of
Ontario, not out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was either he was over there and got
this seed from the triple SC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys in the, you know, the eighties and
nineties would have, this was,
[SPEAKER_01]: would have been when we got it,
would have been mid mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm going to say mid nineties,
give or take a few years kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but this, we knew that when
we did grow it inside fuck 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was, uh, it was finishing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, I'd love to see some pictures of it
sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, but then I'm not good pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the ass fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really weird strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pistole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the gentleman that was growing it,
I think he even has tin foil on the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going back that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it wasn't phototron years,
but it was like the first time of HID
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting being brought in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to make it as reflective as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my first garden, I was a,
uh, was a gut refrigerator, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and lined with tin foil and, uh,
um, fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we didn't have, and we basically
built a phototron in our garage back in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, toast who was my roommate back
then we were both fucking surfer skater
[SPEAKER_01]: pothead kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first person that I knew that
grew, uh, under HID, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 watt in his closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I lived with those, uh,
and he was using four into Rockwell cubes
[SPEAKER_01]: in, um, in Tupperware dishes, you know,
under a 400, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we got off topic again,
but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with the golden boy,
that's again, where you, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that name come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my seed collection, because of the
speed, it set up whatever I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, going to grow it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so here like, okay, so we got another
black Domina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a black Domina female and we
had a sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three cross blueberry male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like that almost sounds like
what I can't remember who was talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about it is describing his black or sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet tooth for some, one of the weird
sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the sweet tooth had black
Domina inserted in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like sweeping, grapefruit,
blueberry, black Domina.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was only for a brief little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's 2.2 or.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sound familiar to me,
but again, if you're trying to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder Steve's head, what he was doing,
what he was looking for, um, going back to
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this would also probably be a seed
that came out in the mid nineties or was
[SPEAKER_01]: made in the mid nineties by us,
my handwriting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and back then I was selling,
uh, S O L seeds in London for Steve,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you will see that I have very,
very, hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a bunch of seed there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the one that dairy stole from
Barney's farm and entered in the cup is
[SPEAKER_05]: the sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he went with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he sells it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sells it as four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I was saying before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got like a vile inside of vile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, which don't know exactly what that
means, but this is where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be nice to get people like Steve on
these forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he can control his temper that,
um, because he has a lot of this knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, what he was doing,
what he was going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was one of the first,
he was the first breeder that I became
[SPEAKER_01]: friends with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the guy that was actually breeding
for genetics, not for seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was reading for seeds to sell,
but you know, he was actually putting the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and the energy into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, any of these seeds that,
I mean, I get started, he gets first
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might come to me and say, well,
Pete, that my strain, my C, my strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get all of it because
I'm going to keep some for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to sell, not the fucking, uh,
uh, put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his, the, the, his genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do what he wants, but you know,
I want to, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you keep all your genetics and you're
fucking in your back pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking lose your pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose that strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's the funny thing too,
where it's like with, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: seed breeding too, it's like, people are
like, I'm going to breed and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: sell these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I still have control or dib
reading, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that happens from that point
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You rent the seed for me, kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like a Monsanto type of thing
where you're like, you don't really own
[SPEAKER_06]: any of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let you grow it and smoke it,
but it's pretty much mine still,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though you paid me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's where it kind of gets
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what I was pointing out for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's going to be, I wish I had better
cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So staying on the SLO stuff because I did
a lot, you know, again, Steve and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: our friendship goes back quite a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, he was one of the first
people that was a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would sell me his seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go on this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see it that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Shishkeberry number three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Shishkeberry three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Shishkeberry two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, in his packaging, cause he
would give me the little vials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got Shishkeberry first
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is where I get confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to Red about it,
which can be a little bit of a sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, but it was, I just knew there was a
yellow and a red line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as far as my extent went to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was going through these seeds,
I was just like, well, this is in Steve's
[SPEAKER_01]: writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in Steve's, well, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Shishkeberry first generation
is in my writing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did he have three different,
and I think Red actually even tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain it to me, but we were talking
about a few different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why I think, you know,
people like Red who has a lot of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: in who is really doing what in his
versions of it, which I will strongly
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with 98% of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you say, I 100% agree with what
I'm saying because it's how I understand
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when it comes to these
seeds, I know Steve would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they're my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anything comes from them,
you get a hundred percent of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm keeping some for myself because I
bought these seeds from you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow for the fucking highest THC
or a certain turf or, or to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make sure like the, you know,
he doesn't want this seed sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the seed come.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't fucking step on somebody's toes
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're his genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have them, but I want to do what I
can to save them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can, so I have them for myself for,
again, if and when the time comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be a time that I'm like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be in fucking, you know,
someplace in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking I'm diluting my seed, fucking
catalog, take everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not at that point yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that point comes, I'm not going to
say, okay, I'm selling my collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say, well, I'm going to say I
have certain people's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're yours kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't care, then sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them out there and I'll fucking
spread the spread, the wealth a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I say, I have a, a sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say, so sweet tooth,
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one or number two, but there's only
like five seeds in a little fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, again, what is that to me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to throw this in there before
I forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like going through like, um, old seed
collections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is very much like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, here's some chicken scratch
that only the guy that put it in there
[SPEAKER_06]: could ever decipher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a weird code.
[SPEAKER_06]: God, he gave me this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I remember this weird vial,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And this weird vial with this SK on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This means this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you were someone else trying to
decipher some, some, one of your friends's
[SPEAKER_06]: seed collections, it would almost be
impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you pretty much need them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like hieroglyphics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would almost need them there to
interpret it for you because if you just
[SPEAKER_06]: got it without any, and I even think,
I mean, there was a thing where,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, you know, Matt, when you and I were
talking about, uh, how we found out that
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, when Neville sold his seed
collection to Shanti, uh, he got pissed at
[SPEAKER_06]: him and then just stopped explaining all
the coats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then didn't know what he had because
there was all these weird coats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, um, um, I think it was,
it was Breeder Steve that when I fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 years ago or something like that,
I was like, Oh, I got these old seeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I haven't stored them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he put me in touch with some guy
on the West coast and the deal was that he
[SPEAKER_01]: gets to keep and do whatever he wants
with, with the seeds that he recovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, well, no, I'm not going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that you, I understand because then
again, he was a friend of Steve's I would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine, but it all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I sent him to him, he could have,
he could have fucked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could have fucked Steve.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every, every, every embryonic rescue
guy I have ever worked with has fucked me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of them were from the West coast
and there've been a few.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got this old thing and if it were,
you're going to pay me a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_06]: rescue this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it doesn't work, I get the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it does work, I get the money and I
get the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great deal for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: The worst case scenario, I make a bunch of
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best case, whatever you get,
I already have it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, like you said, with the,
with the chicken stretch and I I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: that, like, cause I told, uh, the,
what I think was the one deal break or
[SPEAKER_01]: what, excuse me, was is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send you all the seats,
but they're numbered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, and I did this with my,
when I was hoarding my genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: people were like, Oh, you know,
I need cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, okay, you're going to get the
LCS number six and you can get LCS number
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I'll tell you when you
harvest the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you're not fucking,
cause nobody's going to say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I got cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sell your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people like, well, what are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, but I know they're
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I don't want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, no, no, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know what the strains are that
we're growing, but we're going to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: resurrect or save.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just said, no, that's not going
to work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did that piss off people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure I'm pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I piss off a lot of people all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really fucking, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm doing, I've saved
these seats for fuck in 20 some odd years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get pissed off at me now
that I'm not turning them over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sorry, but you know,
I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: After that long, you get to be the
custodian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind fucking giving them back
after they're saved and they're secured
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're not going to get fucking,
um, fasterized and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to just, you know,
um, let anybody like there'll be,
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conditions of what, what is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and if somebody like the one guy
is like, listen, if you're true to your
[SPEAKER_01]: word, that you're going to be,
um, honest, then you, if you want me to
[SPEAKER_01]: trust you, then you have to trust me and I
am going to send you, um, my, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: my golden haze, but I'm not going to tell
you it's golden haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you it's, you know,
it's a code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're like, yeah,
it's resurrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, um, I'm going to know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, uh, if it's my strain and I'm
like, okay, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you what the fuck it is,
but there's going to be certain ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do best of luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who the fuck Eric is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, like you were saying,
we get stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I started doing with this stuff is
I started reaching out to, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: S O probably sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, best of luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed you, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody that probably had bought
grapefruit seeds from me, not fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: growing them in his fucking backyard or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's saying, well, this is what it
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, are they worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a hundred percent, because it
might be that one sweet tooth fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're going to pop a bunch of
sweet tooth, you might as well pop that
[SPEAKER_01]: one with them and see if it just say,
and it's not up to me because I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet tooth that I grew, but I don't
remember the sweet tooth that Steve grew
[SPEAKER_01]: or red group, you know, like they,
and when I was talking with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: with red about this, I was just like,
well, you know, is, is this Shishkeberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wanted to send them a nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up the Shishkeberry and I was just
like, it kind of doesn't look like the red
[SPEAKER_01]: or the yellow line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, send me a fucking nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fortunately never did it, but I still
have a package to send red to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was talking about right here
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one he has the punch in skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know what's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when I told red, he, that's the
only one he really showed interest in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh dude, would they
probably store it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, ah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing, you know, um, with certain
people right now, they're super busy in
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super fucking focused on their
family and, uh, providing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for them and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have the ability to, to send these
seeds to somebody and say, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to do through,
uh, teacher culture embryo embryonic,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they call it, salvation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're not see when those plants,
if these seeds pop, then I want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a copy of each cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're going to breed them,
breed them, open breed and send fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: the send red fucking all the shit he
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he still want it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's, you know, but maybe at certain
times they might just say, ah,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the ester years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now one of a, one of these,
uh, old breeders said that to me recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, ah, you know, what Pete,
like the fucking we're on to such better
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's old history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody cares about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where I'm, I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I care a lot about the old sensey stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hillbilly near hillbilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so again, rumor has it, I'm going to
say now magic carpet by hillbilly,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, his first name is Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't going to say his name,
but I'm like, he's public with his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't even know where he's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's California, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think he sounds like he's from
Kentucky, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought he came again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumor has it, um, that he was one of the
seed providers of the first legal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana garden in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Flynn flon Manitoba in that
old, um, mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the name of it, the company,
but basically it was when health Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying to set up the failure of the
meta of the marijuana community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they were doing was they had,
Oh God, I just had to tip my tongue to
[SPEAKER_01]: the, they were saw growers that got the
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and again, this is where people
know different, please pipe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were only allowed to sell seeds
that were confiscated by the RCMP and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all they could grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they knew where the seed was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't supporting the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the guy that was growing it,
um, was producing crap, shitty,
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting on his shelf for fucking years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden the pot started
getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy had, you know, we saw pictures of
the gardens, phenomenal fucking facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had tons of money, millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in the most secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then our fucking national men either way
in and one way out and it was two
[SPEAKER_01]: kilometers below the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like you could just fucking
drive a tank through his, through his door
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, supposedly these seeds made it in
through a back door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the guy's pot started,
uh, um, did it revolve around?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't even know what the strains
were back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what, what Schmeeve Schmuck,
that's a good name for him, was,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, was most known for was the heroin and
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he came down, I know he was in the
medical scene in California for a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our friends, again,
how I remember hearing that the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: came from California to this guy called
Hillbilly genetics and were able to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their way into Flintlawn kind of thing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if it was, uh, again,
if somebody knows this, uh, Steve guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: if he's out there and, uh, has a contact
to him, you know, please let them know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, those two strains that I
just mentioned, um, you know, I bought
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he wants them back, you know,
um, he's more than welcome to whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking seed or plant comes from these
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's about sharing for me,
this box of seeds I have is for sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get into certain things like
the Berry Berry, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is these two pictures behind me,
my first, my first centerfold in high
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got lots of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stable by any stretch of the
imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad, but I would say,
I mean, it was probably like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably back across maybe three
times, two or three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad, but again, I wasn't a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a seed producer kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I might have a, you know,
a little bit of a different intention and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore I wasn't going crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the people, I mean,
Steve telling me that he, when he chose
[SPEAKER_01]: the male, the, this resinous blueberry
male, he was actually smoking male flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or because of the, uh, because it was
a resin producing male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: His famous resin producing blueberry male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was like, yeah, I've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what you'd be smoking
have you, but whatever has resin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that way you're going to get
some of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the turps are going to be in that
resin, you know, so maybe that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, was, uh, a little bit more than I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying, wow, this is fucking
great pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a male of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a female of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to guess I'm going to grow it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to find a male that best
reproduces, represents the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cross it back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was in the Berry Berry?
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, uh, it came for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came to me, um, which a lot of
genetics did because we had a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the only ones at the time in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is before Mark was a dark enemy was
selling anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it was a, you know, somebody came
in and they don't look, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: try this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that awesome?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, same with the Boris,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boris was another strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I didn't really care about the
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names are the least of my concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was worried about what it
produced and for, uh, medicinal and for,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, for medicinal bag of like,
I wouldn't say bag appeal, but it had to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit, um, a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Criteria is for us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it to be medicinally, uh,
useful to, we needed to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get people to grow it for us
because the deal we made with all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is we get you a legal license to
grow certain amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep 50% of the, uh, the harvest to,
to pay for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other 50% goes to the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the client that you're growing for
never pays a dime for fucking anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets all the pop for free and you get a
high yielding, you know, great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The center will take, will, will,
will buy all the pot, but half of it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to us at no cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of, it helps us pay our bills
and, and keep to be a, a not, not,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for profit society.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not nonprofit, but we were
registered as a not for profit society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was that goal to that triangle that
I was trying to create, even with grow
[SPEAKER_01]: shops, bringing in local grow shops
saying, um, if you give our medical
[SPEAKER_01]: growers discounts, then we'll send you all
our medical growers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the growers,
if you're going to sell just to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a discount from the grow shop and
we're going to pay you fair value and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll take all the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made, and then the, the client never
had to pay for pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was a way to kind of,
um, kind of get, get everybody what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want and make sure everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if one person in that, uh,
triangle wasn't happy, it falls apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that's what I'm, I'm,
I try to do all the time and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: people get pissed off at me for it,
but you know, fuck them kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this says NYPD Boris, but underneath
it, it's says there's a DMV Filo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Filo taxi, are you familiar?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, I think that's, I'm not sure if
I'm pronouncing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filo taxi, Filo taxi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of being two brackets,
it has a third bracket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So theory being you're going to get a
third more pot off a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to be triple bracket instead
of a double bracket kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime I saw that, I got excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, there's a file there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, um, let's save it male,
female, just so we can use it to cross
[SPEAKER_01]: into some of our genetics to see if we
can, we can recreate that, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's, I don't think we ever
were able to, honestly, I think it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were chasing a dream kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it's stress related or what cause
it was a trait or if it was stress related
[SPEAKER_05]: or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a trait, but it was like
one in, in my experience, like one in 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably at least one in 500 that you
would actually see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't something that we saw very
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did see it, it was fairly,
so like I would set these aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's, it just says NY,
NYPD Boris, but the, uh, DMV was,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I don't know if I can say his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not on the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a super nice guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something millennium bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, his name is Dan Miller.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a fucking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a famous strain though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Miller, bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of it upstairs apartment kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's, it's definitely like an old
strain list and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only way I would have heard of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is a local kid here who I just
ran into not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, he's in my book actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, short story was he was one of the
growers for the nation, uh, not,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, LCS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was part of the, what we would say
the honor guard, like he was nation
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he just, uh, he came with a
cutting that one and Evan flow table just
[SPEAKER_01]: produced these big fat, massive and
crusted, uh, colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it so perfect sea of green,
perfect for the, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, um, the gorilla back, you know,
basement gardens that are all running Evan
[SPEAKER_01]: flow, you know, short sea of green type of
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so we, we just started calling it
a DMV because we named it after him
[SPEAKER_01]: because he didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, um, a cutting that came from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we saw it and I was like,
well, that's what we need for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, our, um, you know, black market,
our gardens that we were trying to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, as much out of as little spot as
possible kind of thing, doing the sea of
[SPEAKER_01]: green kind of thing, not worried about
plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DMV was, was a strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I was growing one of my,
one of my rooms, which was just a bedroom
[SPEAKER_01]: in one of my apartments, when people came
by, I just told them that was his
[SPEAKER_01]: initials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my roommate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't allowed in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, he locks the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, he's away a lot kind of
shit, but the Dan Miller bud was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden, but I told people, and he's a
super fucking good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, uh, he left the nation a little late.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little sour, unfortunately, but,
um, hopefully I resurrected that
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship because he was just one of
those people that, you know, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these seeds get, uh, reproduced or get
saved, he'd be the first one on the phone
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, Hey dude, it's not the DMV,
but it has the DMV in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we do an open pop, uh, pollination,
there's a chance one of those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be your strain and you can
have as much as you want kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them aside to kind of be,
so this is something else that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, came up when we would, when I sent you
that, uh, and I don't know if you can post
[SPEAKER_01]: the, and I can send you a few more
actually, the, uh, menu that we had back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the great Canadian Emporium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, early mid nineties to,
uh, mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one specifically?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I could put them up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically any of the ones, but this one
here has, um, this is how we used to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little, well, she'd say that this
is how we sold some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they all just went into little,
uh, the gram vials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, so this here is, uh, an Afghani
black Domina sensei skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing the, the black Domina
sensei skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crossed black down with so much shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loved the Nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we really loved, loved the description
that sensei put in their catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew, our, uh, our minister of,
uh, uh, he was our artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that actually, when you look
at all the artwork from hemp nation,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's, uh, he's the artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I want to meet that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to use some of that art,
like modern times.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Showing you the, the NYPD, like he did
characters of all of us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have dreads back then,
but I had, um, I'd wear my hair in
[SPEAKER_01]: braided, uh, pigtails, I guess,
because anytime I went out into the bush
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had to wear my backpack,
I had super long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would grade on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't get stuck in the backpack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so he would, he drew a picture of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know with my braids and it's the
release of the NYPD, uh, cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: minister of agriculture, Sunday cannabis
talks, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you'll see, I did find a
few of these, uh, these blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aren't, we didn't breed these as
much as we wanted to, uh, spread the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that said, I just remember the,
uh, that Sensi skunk was huge for us back
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, and it was a, it was like,
it was, you know, how the super skunk has
[SPEAKER_01]: that really pungent smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, skunk one has that big cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this, this Sensi seemed to have like a
little bit of the two where it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it had the, it had the smell,
but it had the, the structure and,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it didn't have the weight,
didn't have the big fat nugs where the
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dominant, you know, being a really
greasy, really, um, um, more singular,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though we did, I have pictures of a
super cropping, uh, plant that we did have
[SPEAKER_01]: the dominant and the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you describe the smell of your
dominant cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, it was pretty nasty,
very kind of tarry kind of fucking rubber
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that more noxious end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it wasn't fruity by the least of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fucking, it was pretty tarry
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like asphalt kind of stuff,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it also, you know, when we super
cropped it, one plant would give us,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, I think the one plant was like three
quarters of a pound inside and four feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall, right off the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pictures of it, but it was super
cropped and it probably vegged for two
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bending and breaking the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we weren't popping, might've
topped once, but everything else was just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking bent down and, and tied down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you call that low stress training?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a term for it today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it high stress training.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super cropping and LST are totally
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we were doing is that's why we
would call it high stress because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking, like we were twisting and
turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we weren't bending down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were breaking the inside herd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so you were popping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super cropping to me is when you break the
inside and then it reforms and it makes
[SPEAKER_06]: like a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, I mean, when we did the super
cropping, super cropping article and now
[SPEAKER_01]: super cropping, I'm not going to say take
claim to it because it was shown to me by
[SPEAKER_01]: two local growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we did the article in high times,
before Soloma did his super cropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was just a reproduction of what my,
of what the, the, um, article about me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess would be, um, it's, you don't want
that knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knuckle is a weak point, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strength point, but it's also a
weak point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want is to have a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of a knuckle, on top of a knuckle,
on top of a knuckle, on top of a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, the, the, the branch doesn't do
this, doesn't do this right angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does this bend, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, it's a knuckle here,
a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a knuckle here, a knuckle here,
a knuckle here, a knuckle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm bending and breaking and then
that plant fucking like flattens out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just, just so people that don't know
generally super cropping is you're like
[SPEAKER_06]: breaking the inner herd while you're,
but you're trying to leave like the
[SPEAKER_06]: outside protective sheath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is unbroken.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're trying, you're not trying to
snap it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the outside breaks, you're trying to
snap it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get an inner break, but the
outside, and then what Matt is saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: low stress training is basically just
bending it over and tying it without any
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of breaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's low stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you're just, you're just
redirecting where the hormones go because
[SPEAKER_06]: of height.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you know, people that tie my guy
used to tie two by fours to his plant tops
[SPEAKER_01]: and the two by four would be, you know,
six inches off the ground when he was
[SPEAKER_01]: done, because he'd have eight branches
tied to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day be three inches off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day be two inches off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually it's sitting on the
ground, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the low stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we would still do that at certain
times, but the theory that I came up with
[SPEAKER_01]: why this worked was because of this local
kid that I met, uh, through the guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: showed me the super cropping technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he was born, his art,
his leg, he had a, he was grown in a
[SPEAKER_01]: deformity where his legs were crossed
inside his mother's womb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he was born, he couldn't walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously his legs were fucking buckled up
his fucking, his, uh, soles of his feet
[SPEAKER_01]: were pretty much turning upwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first so many years of his
life, every year or six months or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, they would go in and they would
break the bone to straighten it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: go and break the bone and then straighten
it and then break the bone again and
[SPEAKER_01]: straighten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took his legs from being this kind of
bent in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time it just broke it open,
broke it open, broke it open, straighten
[SPEAKER_01]: it, straighten it until he could walk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if you ever broken a
bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't break a bone in the same place
twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much physically impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you get such a calcium buildup on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could break, if you could break
your arm, uh, 20 times, you can form your
[SPEAKER_01]: arm to be whatever shape you want it to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you break it, if you have your arm
and it's broken and then you break it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you set it this way and then you set it
this way and then you set it this way,
[SPEAKER_01]: your forearm will be bent like that and
sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we did the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were doing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were super cropping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the very beginning, you can't twist
and turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to just pinch and you just go
around it because it's so soft tissue and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just slowly pinch and you don't pinch
in the same way on the same side and same
[SPEAKER_01]: angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rotate, you rotate until the whole
plant is like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day you're going to see
that, that shoot pop up and it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be sitting like this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's going to be kind of bent up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a eventually, you know,
that's going to be strong enough that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can have your main cola two feet off the
ground, four feet or three feet from the
[SPEAKER_01]: center of where your plant is and not have
to use any tomato cages, not have to use
[SPEAKER_01]: anything because that, that, uh,
inside herd is one solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when you, you harvest a
plant, you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see sometimes that center,
um, canal in the middle of a, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of your branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, when we were super cropping,
especially towards the end of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were doing it with the big moms,
it would take two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have one guy holding a broomstick and
the other guy fucking push until you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: that snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one come back, we'd snap it
the other way and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you went to cut that plant down,
you couldn't use fucking scissors to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking branches off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use a fucking saw to cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was solid kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would, uh, so the block domino was
great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skunk one was great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get, you know, it was the block domino
that was like the key to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I know I do have pictures of
this, the one group block domino plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that this kid grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a mutual friend of Shawnee kids
of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were speaking about them last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, till we'll just call him till for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, um, he was an epileptic that
didn't leave his house very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was perfect candidate to show this
technique too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sat here today, fucking trained all
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if he, if he wanted to,
you know, if he had the focus,
[SPEAKER_01]: he could have created, you know,
two pounds off of three plants under one
[SPEAKER_01]: light kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could it's super cropping is
designed for people like right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, we can have four plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a basement that has seven
foot ceilings for plants, isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know one guy that has,
uh, one plant per thousand watt and each
[SPEAKER_01]: plant covers, you know, probably a five
foot by five foot space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's growing anymore,
but, um, you know, was, I don't know if he
[SPEAKER_01]: was super cropping either, but that's what
super cropping was intended for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, um, Kyle, uh, flew me to
Amsterdam and had me talk at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the, my topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: My topic was basically super cropping and,
and why and how.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really early take on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Oh, here's your fucking, I call you
call them feminize self-pollinated seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're G8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the golden haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just says self-pollinated,
which to me means hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not want to grow this fucking
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally grow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't scared of no fucking herms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm petrified of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this was the, uh, the ski pa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ski pa was, uh, hemp nation honor guard
passed away from, uh, from, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: pancreatic cancer was a client at the,
at the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was one of the guys that when we,
when I say honor guard, uh, Chris will
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of elaborate on this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he ever comes on the show, no matter
what I had, no matter where I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys were allowed to come into my
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And take over the fuck they want off the
shelf behind the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could walk in and say, Pete,
I need fucking 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, if it's in the till,
it's yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's you, you don't pay for,
you want a bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come in and you take a bong,
you know, you need weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give you weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So skipper was one of the first,
if not the first honor guard person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that at my friend's record store,
except that he doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to just go in and just take what I
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these guys, there's a few people in
this town, uh, that have that anybody from
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp nation family knew whether they took
advantage of it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they walked into organic traveler,
my head shop, they take whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they built me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the foundations to, um,
to, to what we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they laid, they're the ones
that kind of laid down to, for us to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to blaze this path that we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, again, and this is probably when
I was being a little bit more protective
[SPEAKER_01]: of my genetics, but skip said,
Hey, listen, you know, like I want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow your, your, um,
your golden haze in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, and I have this, uh,
blue skunk and I have a male of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to cross it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, well, I don't have
seeds of the golden haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than self pollinated, but I said,
you know what, if you want to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me, you know, I probably gave
me as many seeds as I wanted, but I only
[SPEAKER_01]: have maybe 15 seeds left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just call it the GHB, which is a
unique name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going back to like the early mid
nineties, having a moment in the sun then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, in Canada, I was just like,
listen, it's golden haze cross with the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm calling it GHB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a sativa dominant one,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had an indica dominant one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: He liked the sativa one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I named the strain the skipper,
skiva, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because his name was skip kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing, genetics that mean fuck all
the, some will mean fuck all to anybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if they grow these out, if they find
that golden haze, I guarantee you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to fucking love it just because of what's
in it and what it like, how it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was that fruity sativa,
fast flowering, short fat plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you just, you don't, you don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to, I wanted to interject
something because anybody, anybody that
[SPEAKER_06]: was growing in the nineties, you just,
you just threw out like what I would think
[SPEAKER_06]: is like a very common, you know,
like sort of a sort of viewpoint,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is, Oh man, this thing's self
pollinated or it made some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that interested in these because
this will screw up the rest of my stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: because of how it was made.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've had a sea change in,
in, in whether that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people that started growing in the
nineties, that was the view was
[SPEAKER_06]: hermaphrodism was going to introduce
something weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then, you know, Matt is one
of the card carrying original members of
[SPEAKER_06]: gender fluidity is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should, we should, we should not
hate on this form of breeding.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe I'm old school, but chicks
with dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big keen on chicks with dicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to get with the times,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in all seriousness, you know, Matt,
Matt can tell you that he got a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: pushback and a lot of hate when he started
pushing feminized breeding at first,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it was considered to be a cheat
code.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was considered to be weakening the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was scandalous behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite, my favorite was that I was
ruining what God intended to be natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd point out actually they started
out intersex.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I'm putting them back to
normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, if you want to, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I didn't see it and any of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get that deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically said, you know, when I'm
growing and especially in large scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything over a few plants actually,
or with somebody with, especially my
[SPEAKER_01]: clients that don't know what to look for,
where if a banana pops out, then I got
[SPEAKER_01]: seedy pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's a practical,
you know, I'm not growing for seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I see that seed, like I said
earlier, I believe, and I honestly believe
[SPEAKER_01]: this to be true that 95% of what we grow
are hermy to one to a certain percentage,
[SPEAKER_01]: to a certain degree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where some might be, you just have to
sneeze and it fucking shoots out a banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some that you have to fucking go as far
as, you know, chloriole, silver or jelbic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid or something that you really have to
fucking stress it to produce that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said there's different ways and
methods now, but in my old school
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality, that's what I always thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they're producing feminized,
not female, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a big difference between an
all female seed pack and a feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized seeds means you're not going to
get a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say you're not going to get a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very high likely that if
you are going to have any hiccups in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, especially outdoors, I would never
put a feminized seed outdoor because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so out of your control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in somebody's garden that is not,
you know, on top of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowledgeable where they can keep a
perfect environment and watering schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: and temperature and, and, um, feed
program, all that kind of thing where you,
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of stress, it's going to trigger
it sooner to produce seed or produce
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to give you a self pollinated
plant or an alpha breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you that, but not for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried, I tried my best over the past 15
years to completely destroy the term
[SPEAKER_05]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was, that was really, really bad
term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, I thought female seeds was a
bad term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought reversed made the most sense
because you're reversing the sex on a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and that's describing the action,
but what to expect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't be telling people what to
expect because there's absolutely every
[SPEAKER_05]: possibility that a plant can be,
you know, have female chromosomes and pop
[SPEAKER_05]: up completely looking male.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way the legal market works
currently, um, all the stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_06]: been involved in that does any kind of
large scale seed popping, it's all
[SPEAKER_06]: feminized seed because nobody wants to get
out there and be like, I have some,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have somewhere between 30 and
70% be males.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to have a crew spend weeks
out there every day going and hacking down
[SPEAKER_06]: boys before they throw pollen anyway,
because some of them are going to,
[SPEAKER_06]: some of them are going to be, um,
fake, you know, I don't want to say fake
[SPEAKER_06]: males, but like, uh, even with them,
even with, even with feminized populations
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've, I've popped, you know,
some pretty large groups at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Occasionally you'll get what looks like a
true male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not a hermaphrodite, not,
not something with male and female
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers, but something that actually looks
like a true male plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do pop up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I was getting at too,
where, you know, and again, this is with
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of knowledge, but, um, where you
have, or what I believe to have a female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you, uh, when you do the,
when you have a hermaphrodite,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're dealing with a mother and a
father, we're bringing into two,
[SPEAKER_01]: two chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very, there's a very more,
very good like likelihood that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have both of them carry over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, especially being a seed
bearing plant that will go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to sell pollinate to continue its
life throughout the season or throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, again, why I think it's written
into Genesis into the Bible is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for this reason where it's one
of those unique plants that if it thinks
[SPEAKER_01]: that, oh shit, you know, there's only
females around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to be able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to flip one of those females
to produce pollen and therefore have
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped seed for the following,
uh, season kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I think makes hermaphrodism so
hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people get all angry about it where
I'm like, okay, so this plan has existed
[SPEAKER_06]: for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was a super successful like
strategy for it to be able to make seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: at times when something might've happened.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometime in the nineties,
we were like, oh, we don't want this
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 30, 30 years ago, people were like,
you know, let's get away from this
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of years of selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when everybody was, was growing seeded
weed and you know, all the tie and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: Colombian and all the Mexican and
everything else was fully seeded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares if there was hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you already, you already were
getting flour full of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really wasn't, it came to is this,
you know, for people like myself that
[SPEAKER_01]: started smoking pot in the, depending on
memory, it's either the late 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: 79 or 80, 81, um, that we had to get the
credit card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fucking album cover out and
fucking, and pull out all that seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my seed to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I started with was,
you know, got a great bag of fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know where the fuck came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably was compressed, has seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, I mean, they,
I'm going to grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did breed a lot of fuck,
fuck a lot of shit into this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bred CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the fucking plant pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were so focused, we went
through the stage of focusing so much on
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, focusing so much on just strong
females, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, we, we lost track of,
you know, the beauty of the versatility of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do you know what, do you know what
CBD was before testing?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just weed that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it wasn't like we were like,
Oh, that is CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, Oh, this one doesn't get me
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to eliminate this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one doesn't work good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, um, you know, people ask me like,
Oh, what was, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your favorite pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to buy our pot on this,
on B 15, which was a street in East
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockaway, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was the $5, um, um,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our first catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is remind me, I think this strain is
on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people ask me like, what is your
favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of your favorite pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like this brick weed that we got
back in like fucking, uh, 82, 83,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, cause it got me super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get me stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got me super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want, I like that getting that super
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go back, go back to that,
uh, so this is us, you know, showing
[SPEAKER_01]: people how to germinate seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know the go back one,
yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look on this, there,
I have, you might be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a purple star cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I wouldn't be surprised if we,
cause you could see, we did a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one crosses there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in the G 13, uh, the Willy's wonder
purple star Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have purple star on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have the skunk one on there,
but what you'll also notice is like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you get into like the, uh, S 50 S 48,
the golden boy, the golden boy was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I crossed a lot of stuff
with because I wanted that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I, you know, I love the purple
star.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's short fast, you know, um,
that silver haze, Mexican sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew this one, this Mexican Steve
outdoors here along the, uh, along the
[SPEAKER_01]: cliffs of Lake Erie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this great garden because you could
be, you could hang it on the, on the beach
[SPEAKER_01]: or on the boat, like be out on the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't see the garden because of
the slope was, um, away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's soaked away from the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew these big, huge, massive
sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, you know, I grow for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, especially there was I get to go to
the beach and hang out with chicks and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then erosion came and it took
down a good section of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd be cruising down like
October into November down the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd look up and there'd be these
huge wall of fucking these sativa plants
[SPEAKER_01]: is Mexican sativa plants that were just
starting to flower in like mid November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, finish, but they were these wall
of cannabis that exposed my entire garden
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I like, I want that sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again, chasing that be 15 fucking
brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, they were, again, they were Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all Mexican fucking pot coming up
to New York back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: mystery mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mystery mix is just a little bit of
God knows what kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be like either we just forgot or
like there was extra seeds or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where we put them in packs of
six and we had three of these leftover
[SPEAKER_01]: throw them in the fucking mystery seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, um, so there was a lot of,
uh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so these will get to our limited
supplies kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we try to do like, we tried to
make this a seed company that sold,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't sell genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to show you, um,
how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, when we came in with,
um, uh, overgrow the government,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Willie's, um, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Zippity do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Zippity is another skeepe strain,
the bongo, which is another strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought, is that the menu that has
the, um, uh, Humboldt County Indica skunk
[SPEAKER_06]: one Northern lights five by Humboldt
County Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now again, what's Humboldt County Indica?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guy fucking, you know, was out in
Humboldt and fucking grabbed a bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking crazy Indica pot and brought back
to see maybe, you know, was you're from
[SPEAKER_01]: that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever hear somebody say,
Oh, this is a Humboldt County Indica.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, Oh, I mean, dude, when I,
I think I may have mentioned it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: previous show or something, but like on
dead tour, one of the most common things
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd ever hear was what kind of weed is
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd be like, Oh, it's Humboldt
County outdoor organic nugs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of, it was like, it was like
one of those catch phrases, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Oh, it's that, it's that Humboldt
County Indica.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that Humboldt County outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that good, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that what you want, you know,
and who knows if it was, but it was just
[SPEAKER_06]: like, that was the, that was the,
if you weren't from California,
[SPEAKER_06]: that was the famous place that good weed
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's not that cartoon guy
there, the marching seat, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want, I want to borrow this from this
artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk to him and see if he'll let
us use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is awesome because he's like,
like I said, he's, I don't even think I
[SPEAKER_01]: sent you all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I'm not sure exactly which
ones, uh, Chris sent me, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, a lot of them that he sent me
were, um, like there's some of the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: star stuff, black domino stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I'll have to send you some more
because there's tons of stuff that he sent
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that I think you have a lot of the
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is pretty cool with the seed,
the angry seed with the army and the bong
[SPEAKER_06]: and, and he's charging, you know,
that's a, it's a good, it's a,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a good cannabis image.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just sent you something else on
signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can get it,
but it has, uh, again, has some more of
[SPEAKER_01]: our, um, our version of why nation was
formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what it was, I think we kind of,
you know, back in the Reagan days,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had, oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually said that Nixon coined that war
on drugs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw cannabis as a fucking,
uh, schedule one fucking same as heroin,
[SPEAKER_01]: cocaine drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was, it was more like weed was
people that used weed didn't vote for
[SPEAKER_06]: Nixon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: People that used weed were minorities and
anti-war protesters and Dems and groups
[SPEAKER_06]: that they had issues with at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a useful club and that they
could use it to attack groups that didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: affect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pretty much with, um, with the,
uh, the war on drugs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we took it as, you know, a war against us,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Us versus them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we formed hemp nation, hemp nation was
formed and built in a regiment that was
[SPEAKER_01]: militant in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the marching seed, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one, uh, artwork I just sent you is,
uh, HB post dreads, uh, in a tank,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that has a bong as it's,
um, cannon kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because we were there to fight
the battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think that, uh, that,
well, what's one of the things I almost
[SPEAKER_06]: thought about mentioning it was that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because, because you're a,
uh, a citizen of both places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been able to move back and forth,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where a lot of us get trapped on one side
of the other fighting the battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you get wrapped up in something
and they're like, Oh no, you can't come
[SPEAKER_06]: back here anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So see with the cannon, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we, we formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it shows me on the left too,
as minister of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to take off and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so I was minister of agriculture
and on Sundays I would have, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little grow, grow talks, grow seminars
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would, you know, with the mental
panel there, we'd show you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to set up a little garden in your
closet, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Sundays from one till five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the tank and that's us behind
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so he, because Chris was a hen,
you can see the bond has the water in the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole fucking bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that, that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, we, the coin overgrow the
government, um, came from, and there will
[SPEAKER_01]: be, uh, more artwork that will actually
show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what the hell was Andrew's thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like, minister of defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had minister of knowledge,
which was Sarah, and she took care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: library and the museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had minister of labor,
which is Billy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took care of the retail store,
minister of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took care of the seeds and minister of
defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Andrew who was quite angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the angriest of us all,
but the way that the government was
[SPEAKER_01]: treating us kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of his super fucking talent,
he put it to, um, to drawings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you walked into hemp nation back in
the day, one, we had the hemp nation flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pot leaf, the green pot leaf,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in the, in the red, uh, red bars,
the Canadian flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then that was probably like 20
feet by 40 feet in our front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like the guy getting back to it's,
we were, we were fighting the war on drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and we formed a nation and Chris,
Chris didn't have a ministry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a grand cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was, he was the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the fucking, the one that told us
kind of what we were doing and how to not
[SPEAKER_01]: give you how to do it, but what he wanted
to see done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, uh, getting back to seeds
because I know we were getting pretty long
[SPEAKER_01]: on our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found my chemo seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're in this little fucking
container and it's just written chemo and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, um, there's how many seasons,
like five seats and a little tiny fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: seats, which, which I think is the,
uh, UBC because the, the Ottawa cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: which.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I thought the chemo came from,
I, I believe 100% I was wrong or we were
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong when we thought that, um,
wasn't really chemo, but it was a chemo
[SPEAKER_01]: that we knew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was better than the chemo,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fucking crazy, strong,
fat, nasty fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nug where the UBC chemo was very quaint
and pink and floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, it didn't have that same
rusty fucking greasy smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, that's a good way to describe
something rusty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rusty, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't know like it was rusty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you would get hit with a fucking
metal pipe kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking crazy strong kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know the history on gelato,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds that I came in, but I'm pretty sure
and it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, but I swear it says gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these seeds are from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seed pack box was from the nineties
gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't be related, you know,
probably just a similar name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is where I was kind of getting
at before where.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it called gelato?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guy grew a fucking plant,
a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck tastes like gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call it gelato.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, where did gelato come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, go through quickly again, the Nebula.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Luke and him and I get along
quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably get along best with Luke out
of all the, um, see people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arjan whose name I don't even know if I'm
pronouncing properly because some call him
[SPEAKER_01]: Arjun, but, um, I always call him Arjan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's never corrected me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arjan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My New York accent doesn't let me say
certain words, certain ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say cauliflower reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really liked him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked Luke as a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love, I love his genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that a lot too about him that
people really do like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the homegrown Fanta seeds,
the blue haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, so with the, the blue haze here,
these seeds in here are not the seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds in this pack are from when we
grew out the, the, uh, blue haze and we
[SPEAKER_01]: picked a male and a female and we used the
male to pollinate my golden haze that we
[SPEAKER_01]: set up for the skipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we kept, uh, we kept, we chose one
of the females and bred our own blue haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to be the exact,
it's not their seed, but it's a seed that
[SPEAKER_01]: we use to make their seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being, uh, maybe not an open population
where we used all the males and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did choose a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We choose, we put more thought into the
male than we did the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose the best female, but we were
looking for that male that I would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross with the golden or skip one and
cross with the golden haze kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we get, so, oh, so then we
get into like, um, Oh, that's new too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, so the, the original packaging
skunk one from, from Sensi again,
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to that age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we, on that last catalog,
you'll see that we carried a skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the skunk one seeds that I
made using the skunk one seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, breeding for seed production,
not for, uh, genetic, uh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did, uh, the pure skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a pure from Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, did it, did it do what we wanted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I keep calling them Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who's flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was again, one of the, from what I'm
told, one of the original skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, holders, let's say and sellers over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so he was one that had like,
let's say the oldest lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Amsterdam for the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was hanging out with one of his
staff in 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, it was 90, 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is hanging out with chick again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I know that word gigolo came up in
some sort of host someplace, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, um, Karen from the Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amsterdam hired me as a gigolo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I fucking Kamir has pictures of me
wearing a pink fucking thong.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I fucking, I was working
with, and I was like, she's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're paying for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I kind of know why, because the years
before I would go around and fucking pick
[SPEAKER_01]: up all the fucking cutest fucking pot
girls from usually all the booths,
[SPEAKER_01]: other seat, hence why Tony from SAG
probably doesn't like me very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he even remembers this, but,
um, but she sold all female apparel
[SPEAKER_01]: because she had sativa sisters,
uh, bed and breakfast in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was animus related Airbnb for before
their Airbnb and, um, and she had the
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam seed seed seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, I can't wear any of
the shirts or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wear a pink thong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under my pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't walking around and fucking the
cup with a pink thong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when it tamed time,
so for photos, you know, I hike the thong
[SPEAKER_01]: up a little bit and pull my pants out a
little bit so you could see it and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's got to be a little bit sexy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, the girls liked it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it worked, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting fucking God knows
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky I didn't come back with something
more than seeds from that trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, Oh, just talking about
Camille.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found a Kalazar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, one of the, like I used to sell
his seat for, for him as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think I did much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, um, this is totally random,
but I saw earlier on your seed catalog
[SPEAKER_06]: that you were offering that you guys,
it looks like you guys did like some like
[SPEAKER_06]: early Pearl and some other like
reproductions of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have, do you have any of that stuff
left?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I didn't see any of that so far
in my, uh, my runnings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did find that maybe we were talking
about the green spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that we did a blueberry green
spirit kind of seed back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, green spirit was big buds skunk one,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think it was based, I think it was
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That big skunk that had, and then it went,
and then I think you were talking about it
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think big skunk turned into sensey
skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think since, and then it needed
another rebranding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it became green spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I knew the rebranding part of
it, where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, again, Names are names
to a certain degree, but the early girl,
[SPEAKER_01]: early Pearl, anything that said early in
it, we liked, we wanted, so when people
[SPEAKER_01]: were coming back, if we knew people were
going to Amsterdam, we're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, pick up the early Pearl,
pick up the early girl, pick up fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that they say finishes in,
you know, under 50 or 50, 55 days kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that for our outdoor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need for indoor too, because we wanted,
we didn't want to fucking grow out,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, 14 week fucking trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, hence the, why you'll see
that, you know, the Mexican sativas and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other fucked up strains that you
just can't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't grow unfortunately,
and stopped growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, like we've got,
we've kind of bred these sativas out of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're, you know, now we're kicking
ourselves in the ass saying, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to start, you know, bringing them
back in because you, people want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to get stolen.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not, you know, there's a,
there's a lot of people, even today
[SPEAKER_06]: there's famous people that are like,
they have a hard cutoff at nine,
[SPEAKER_06]: nine or 10 weeks is like the upper limit
of how long most people will let their
[SPEAKER_06]: strain go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, even 12 is rare for most people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you tell someone it takes 12 weeks,
they're not interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's some people who take it
to 12, no matter what, no matter what
[SPEAKER_06]: people have their sweet spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so again, another fucking because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early sensey star kind of stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, um, and you know, what's funny
about that is, is that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_06]: that it got released, I think in 95 or 96.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, Luke will still not reveal what
he, what made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Won't say a word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Won't say a word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though, even though it was 27 years
ago or something like that, or 28 years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, so ancient at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: He still won't be, I took this and this
and made sensey stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody can possibly remake it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send him a picture of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make sure I still have his number and
I'm going to ask him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what he made now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me not to reveal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to reveal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I would like, no, I never even
thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like, fuck, I like his fucking his
eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what he's looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His sidekick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I mean, I'm not trying to like throw
them under the bus or anything like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Simon from serious seeds,
but he's never revealed what AK 47 or Kali
[SPEAKER_06]: missed has in it either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those things are just as old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, come on, dude, it's been almost
three decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tell us what you, it's not like I can
get how in the mid nineties, they were
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I'm not going to tell you what's in
the secret sauce because I don't want
[SPEAKER_06]: someone to steal it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck finding the parents anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck finding the ingredients to make
the sauce.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it probably comes down to is they
just don't want to admit who they got it
[SPEAKER_06]: from, who got jobs for what or just the
fact that like, Oh, this came from Neville
[SPEAKER_06]: and this came from this person or this
came from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't, they just don't want to
say, um, mostly I got some of those Bella
[SPEAKER_01]: Donna too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good score.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's something again, what they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that I've sent that to,
uh, to red cause I didn't even know we
[SPEAKER_01]: made them fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, uh, this is what we, we,
uh, won the, well, we didn't win the
[SPEAKER_01]: cognitive game in second or third with it
or something like that placed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We placed with that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't because the pot was that
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because I was a fucking
jiggle of slut that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was honor the goddess here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, this is my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I say Steve stole my metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is because I hope he sees this and he's
going to bitch at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to laugh at it too,
because he's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they know it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew out the, uh, in the outdoor field,
we grew out all those old Neville strains
[SPEAKER_01]: again, going by the story I've been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Ortega was a very large part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because it had the biggest,
uh, probably history and appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there was the, the fast fatty,
the fast spear and the nightingale that
[SPEAKER_01]: were these really tall gangly fucking,
uh, sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I liked sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the field every day working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to smoke sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't afford to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, um, when it came time to enter
the cup, all those guys said nothing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they want nothing to do with the fast
beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get him high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't smoke the Ortega because it got
me too stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would smoke the sativa and they're like,
yeah, dude, this doesn't fucking garbage,
[SPEAKER_01]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to take it, take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, so I took it because I
wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also knew that it was honor the goddess,
the girls, you know, Hillary was part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the, one of the judges,
one of her sidekicks, I forget her name,
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful little blonde girl was,
uh, was also asked to be a judge,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I knew that's what they're
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was organically grown outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full sun, organically grown sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's panty remover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I, we, we won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now did we win because it was best pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we won because there was fucking these
Canadians were dumb enough to fucking fly
[SPEAKER_01]: kilos of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This in their backpacks into fucking
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a coffee shop to sell it
out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to sell stickers for 40 guilders
and you got a free eighth of pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a way like we were getting in
trouble because you can't sell pot at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wherever it was being held.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what it's called, but,
um, you know, so we were finding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't buy a sticker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold these one hitters that shockwave
glass made for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, um, and it was, uh, it was,
um, a type of pot that I knew was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking be loved by the judges and the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I played up all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think why we won the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had nothing to do really so much with
the big and great pot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't, but it got the girls dancing,
got the girls jiggly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's what was selling their
kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so yeah, we talked about Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept his chronic, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Simon, when I, when I was saying
early, I did a little, I was invited to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk at the cannabis cup about Canadian
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mainly super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I don't know even what Simon was
talking about, but him and I shared shared
[SPEAKER_01]: a stage and, um, and I think Steve was
invited, uh, when he, he was at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they asked him to speak as,
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's when I picked up the Russian
because it was the AK 47 was this huge
[SPEAKER_01]: deal, but he kept raving about the Russian
and it was fairly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I, this is might've been a few
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure when it came out,
but I believe it came out in like the mid
[SPEAKER_01]: late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would have been 99.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he ranked raved about it so much
that, uh, we brought back seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you talking about the white
Russian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still grow it and I still love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it was one of our, it's one of our
best sellers at the center.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an old white Russian cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got, I think it's the fucking,
the bomb fucking white Russian is a good
[SPEAKER_06]: line, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so, I mean, the one thing I'll say
about Simon is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: he basically sold the same six strains for
like 20 years or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I think the chronic is terrible,
but the bubble gum and the AK 47 and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Kali mist and the white Russian are all
real in their era.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, uh, the triple X straight?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know of it, but I, I've never
had any experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always thought it was from Simon
because he has his triple X in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, in the logo logo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't have any, not,
I don't have any, I don't have any like
[SPEAKER_06]: tidbits on that one or whatever,
but I can say that, that his, his AK 47
[SPEAKER_06]: and his Kali mist and white rush in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were phenomenal pot in that era.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were really, they were really there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had really good strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, um, not so is your phone going to
die.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, but yeah, I'm going to,
I'm going to be here until it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, I'm like, I only have a few more
cause you don't care about butchers
[SPEAKER_01]: beaver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is, but it's from the
state because it has a Marlboro fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: symbol on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it says Nevada city, California
latitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why I've never even heard of Nevada
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we just lose him because of his phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so then the other thing that we get to
is, um, oh, we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with, uh, S O L this is like,
this is his plumb, but the plumb,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, I remember you mentioning that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not sure, um, what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my speculation, but after certain
conversations, it would be something that
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve or red might be able to,
um, explain more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have where I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought it was a, a phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of a certain cross that,
that Steve did that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the sweet tooth came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then this one's called blonde
bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, STB and three, which is a strawberry
blonde that you had, um, in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was crossed with the,
it's whatever the, the male from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Louie, which, um, I think this was,
I think this was with, and that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the SB stands for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's those sweet tooth cross
with the strawberry, strawberry blonde.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says SB STB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tooth blonde.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blonde or back cross, but it has the M
three and maybe, maybe I can ask red.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that might be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be the, because if I remember
correctly, Steve had a sweet tooth male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he had, again, this would be
better for Steve or for Steve or for red,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they just stuck in the corner behind a
fan and fucking hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just flooded the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, um, that's where, you know,
they made the Louie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made a few other strange separate
and then state stick with his stuff is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the big funk and the sweet tooth
number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mailed from him because they're
actually in, uh, the core class,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we used to mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last but not least is the,
uh, blueberry now, very cool where the,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are coming from that same era,
just judging by what they're packaged in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So judging by the, uh, big funk,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, which is, uh, spice of life,
early genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what blueberry was coming through then
and were though, how closely DJ was
[SPEAKER_01]: working with those guys at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine this is probably from that
era judging by, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, judging by a sweet tooth or being a
part of that era, they all came in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the same era kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, I don't know if it's,
uh, the 93, you know, but the 93,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I just keep it in as a, um,
as a mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be cool to do an open
pollination with that for the 93,
[SPEAKER_05]: his mom cut in there and yeah,
like I have some of his like some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff he released last year or the year
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't even touch that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's someone else doing it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that, uh, who was doing it,
but you know, the fact that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, that what's in it,
the thing is, you know, do they breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they bred out what DJ was looking
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now they're breeding for what
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, what I'll say is like after
going and spending tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars on Bluetooth, blueberry and DJ
short stuff and hunting a very specific,
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted a blueberry plant that looked
like blueberry purple, but smelled like
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry jam, you know, just the whole,
and I didn't find that in anything
[SPEAKER_05]: directly from DJ short.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that from hybrids of DJ short
stuff or people that worked his lines
[SPEAKER_05]: further that weren't him and weren't his
son.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I found it and I did find it
eventually in other stuff that had his
[SPEAKER_05]: work in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, you couldn't find it without
his work in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my B nine three, my B 93 doesn't go
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go purple, but it has that pint
of blueberry, not that fake blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, but the blueberry really rich
blueberry smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, Jay comes from that era,
which that seed, I wouldn't be surprised
[SPEAKER_01]: if I had a few of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would maybe those seeds are from
that, that early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, um, that's it for what I kind of
pulled out for you guys, except for,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I did a, a sweet tooth blueberry berry
cross because I really liked that very
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get into all the other
stuff because a lot of this stuff probably
[SPEAKER_01]: won't really all really interest,
uh, anybody, but it'll give you an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what my goals were back then my phone,
my, uh, my, things going to die too.
