[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a little early just to let the
crowd build up before old sonat dog gets
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking at this old Hemp BC
catalog and thinking how nice would it be
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some of that NL5 purple indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think we might have just
made some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I would be interested to see
what the BC purple indica is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much different it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like this NL5 Hawaiian indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is the BC Seedco stuff,
which is probably five by two,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just five, but we don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll... Anyway, so yeah, I was just
shooting this shit, trying to build shit
[SPEAKER_01]: up before dude gets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's a haps, ladies and gents?
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are gonna talk about,
I actually have it written down,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote things down this time,
tried to be more organized for y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is gonna be, it's gonna start off
as the bro science episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is essentially like different things
you hear in cannabis that like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty sure are real.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they just turn out to be old wives
tales.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense to any old wives hanging
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we thought that would be cool
when someone gave us that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Hawaiian Lights stuff,
probably the dog shit Hawaiian Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of all the unique
possibilities that come from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably gonna be the one
in the bomb threat, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: because bomb threats the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the so nut dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Darby lapping up a pool of water,
all loud as fuck.
Evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hiding from the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fan on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the audio weird at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Bryn just brought her some stuff
from Trader Joe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's a strawberry lemon scrub,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had a sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down a bunch of stuff today to go
over and I don't know if you had a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: to write anything down or do you have
anything you want to just start off the
[SPEAKER_01]: jump with?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could start off the jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so we thought we would talk for a
bit about bro science versus real science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let's do a quick, I don't know
what you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say, this is, you know, this is what
we know as best as we know it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am often wrong, constantly wrong and you
know, shit updates all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is as best as we know it right now
as we are trying to bring it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you find something different and
have a strong opinion on it, let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always open to new suggestions and
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it is because there's a yeah,
I mean that that could go for almost any
[SPEAKER_00]: show when we talk about history or this or
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to give you like a version
that we hope is pretty accurate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's areas where you can misspeak,
you know, or just areas where that later
[SPEAKER_00]: on you get a detail comes on that changes
your perspective on something too.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a long time, yeah, actually,
our buddy just said we should maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that, like flush versus no
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's actually a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole idea is more of like now
that cannabis is becoming legal and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and all this different stuff,
there's an aspect where actual science is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting used on it, where for a long time,
the science that was getting used on it
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were left with a lot of
observational stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like breeding and stuff
like that and Punnett squares,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, like, like taking other
knowledge from other forms of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and work and trying to apply it
to weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's only really been
probably the last 10 years, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone asked me to bleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, five, maybe 10 years that opened
up enough that like more science is being
[SPEAKER_00]: done on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, not only more science
is being done, but like more reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists in their field are willing to
get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give their opinions on stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and so like kind of like a
theme of like what what we knew then
[SPEAKER_00]: versus what we know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and because a lot of this
information in history and otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: the science part is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is is oral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's passed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's passed down from older stoners to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you hear about it through people
you respect and all this different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's that's kind of
how information was disseminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forums and little BBS is back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little little friend circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little friend circles at the grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little friend circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The few books or few stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or most people would just read stuff from
other disciplines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to apply it to read as best they
could adapt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people like even in the sense of
like the even in the sense of like medical
[SPEAKER_00]: information, Matt and I were talking about
this, where it's like for a long time it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, it still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to the DEA's permission to
even study it because you couldn't possess
[SPEAKER_00]: it legally without their say so.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like 40 years, they would do this
thing where they would only approve
[SPEAKER_00]: studies looking for cannabis harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you said your study was I want to
look and see if it shrinks Matt's balls
[SPEAKER_00]: and gives him anxiety and shortens his
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, here's some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd find out it absolutely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanted to say, I want to see if
it lowers Not-So-Dog's freaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, blood pressure and like,
you know, increases his appetite and
[SPEAKER_00]: lowers his stress level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowers his estrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would deny it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is, is that they ended up
you got like 40, you got 40 years plus of
[SPEAKER_00]: science looking for cannabis harms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they wanted data points that could
prove their case and make keeping it
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal and keeping it the way that it was
to have like scientific backing
[SPEAKER_00]: propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, we have a lot of
knowledge and we have a lot of extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: studies on what the worst stuff that
cannabis does, because that's all they
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have relatively little shit on what
it's good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and even stuff like,
you know, we're going to have a upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: episode where it's all about aromas and
scents and terpenes and all this different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even just the terpene itself aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and the names behind those
things rather than people just describing
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, people weren't talking
terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still suck at that part myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even like knowing what the terps are,
knowing how they combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like you take art,
there's only so many primary colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you start blending those primary
colors and you can get all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: shades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 million, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to some degree,
scents are like that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start blending terpenes and theoles
and all these other things that I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: mispronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like when we were getting
into cannabis, none of that stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: being studied on any kind of accessible
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the closest I saw, like when I was
getting in was DJ's, like olfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was, that was cool, but that was
more like a wine, like a training your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose to other things you might recognize
as a scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't so much science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so a lot of a lot of bro science
ends up just being like observational shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that may or may not be right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I joked with Matt on an
earlier podcast or whatever that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, back in the day, like we used to
put our favorite Nuga Mexican in the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: In resin chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd smoke and you'd smoke that last
because the, you know, the science was
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to coat that bud and all that
unburned THC in resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that dang fucking resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last nug you smoke of your
bag is the best one because it's coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: all that extra free goo that's going to
get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best if you scrape,
scrape the resin chamber first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: coat that on the outside of the bud too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was, I mean, that was like,
that was accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did science knowledge in my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super common, common in the
eighties and nineties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, so you take your best bud and
you'd ruin it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd like sit there and smoke it
and it would burn all funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it had all this like wet,
you know, metal pipe goo, but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was the accepted thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you read, that was the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put that there so you could fit a
button and resonate the button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we didn't have any science to tell
us otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's stunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that much, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, that was accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there used to be a thing,
which is funny now, because when you dig
[SPEAKER_00]: into history, most fire is herm,
but I mean, it used to be accepted bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, seeds from hermaphrodites
were shittier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that like, you don't, if you use that,
like you could fuck up the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted like straight male,
female mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you know, if you, you know,
popped hermy seeds, the chances that it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be hermy and you'd never be able to
get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people were scared of,
of beans and buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also, the conclusion was that
herms had low THC every time too,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Kush and the sour diesel and
like a million phenomenal fire weed is all
[SPEAKER_00]: like hermy bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like we didn't understand
breeding enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science of breeding, you know,
we thought that like, if you did a male
[SPEAKER_00]: female, you probably wouldn't get the herm
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hermed, you know, not that if
the plant hermed, it obviously had the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it hermed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, that's what it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already had the gene in it or it
wouldn't have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a special gene that, that isn't in
most cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of bred it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herm gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to, so we had to, uh,
proto pipes are actually made in one town
[SPEAKER_00]: North of me in Willets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're still made there a little
shop, you know, the proto pipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: strangely enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a classic early head shop metal
pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it had the lid that went on the
top and it had the scraper and it had the
[SPEAKER_00]: little resin chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the whole thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and so, you know, so a lot of
this stuff is like, you start smoking and
[SPEAKER_00]: you start learning the legends and the
shit like that around your little circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start reading some books,
you know, and that's kind of where like
[SPEAKER_00]: bro science comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro science is like people observing stuff
and then saying it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people around you agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it sort of gains weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like a bunch of people are saying
it and then you're telling some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some younger person than you
about it and they just buy it hook line
[SPEAKER_00]: and sinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now obviously like with,
um, you know, with feminized breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, like that, the whole
science of, you know, or even like,
[SPEAKER_00]: even here's another bro science thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Matt and I were chatting about,
which is, um, you know, pale seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best health healthiest,
most mature seeds are all dark and have
[SPEAKER_00]: tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some truth to like fully
tiger striped seeds are mature for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part and pale seeds can be immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as any breeder will tell you that that
tiger stripe is a skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thin little layer, like an onion
skin almost on the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you blow your seeds,
like we all do, you know, like we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually put it through a blower and
it, and it blows the, the husks off and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy for him to get knocked
around and not the tiger stripe also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's also the fact that,
you know, like they're, they're little
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny African land raised seeds that are
like yay big, that are totally black or
[SPEAKER_01]: totally gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just really depends on the
region, the type, uh, the type of pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the maturity of the pollen hitting the
plant, what part of the plant was making
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed, all sorts of stuff goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but in the back of the day,
it was pale seeds bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still, and it still persists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was having a talk, uh,
this week with our, our, our homie Caleb,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was saying that like, you know,
a lot, a lot of seed he throws into the
[SPEAKER_00]: not good pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would have pretty damn high
germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff that like, if,
if anything's even remotely great,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if I know that's like genetic on it
and it's just what it is, I won't sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that it just, it's going to
cause problems.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll say, you know, he'll start out
with a bunch of dark tiger striped seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put them through the blower and
you put them in some bags and you handle
[SPEAKER_00]: them and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, there's one or two
that have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the pack is, is,
doesn't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, but that was like
straight science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you got all white seeds was a sign
of immaturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's one of the most extreme ones you
think you've heard when it comes to bro
[SPEAKER_01]: science?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I started with it with
the, with the put resonate your buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one in the, in the hermaphrodism
contaminating everything forever more and
[SPEAKER_00]: ruining your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, uh, early on when I lived
in, in, um, Isla Vista, I had a dude come
[SPEAKER_01]: up to me at a party and tell me that he,
he shocks his plants with batteries to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn them purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at some point, somebody told them
that they shocked their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning shock it with, you know,
cold or extreme temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took that to mean, Oh, I put my car
battery, hooked that shit up, fucking jump
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit and turns it purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of my favorites that you
shock your plants with electricity to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: them purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, there was always some,
and the, and the issue is, is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when it like, because when bro
science ended, it wasn't like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing either, because, uh, when actual
science started getting into play before
[SPEAKER_00]: all we had was observational traits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all breeding was all selection was
done, um, based on observed observable
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's all you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it look?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the leaves look like, what the resin
content did?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you started getting all this
data, people started trying to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: all this data into breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that someone brought up the
Kool-Aid one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another fave.
[SPEAKER_01]: The what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeding the plants Kool-Aid to turn them
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or adding flavors to the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make some cherry that way with some
Kool-Aid powder to the roots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now it is the one thing that is
true is that if you do, if you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a plant that has a propensity to
turn purple, you can shock it sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: with cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one's actually true, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got started mostly when you get some
cold snap nights out here, outdoor style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd see some stuff that had been
green all summer and all of a sudden it
[SPEAKER_00]: went dark on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden it was fucking black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see, you'll see some
people like, you know, trying all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like pouring ice on top of their weed
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get that color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all of a sudden color is important
for the last few years again, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sugar water to make it froggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, I think most sugar water,
like the, the, the pores on the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: too small to even absorb it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly there to like feed the
microbiome or whatever that's in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mass more so than it is to like shoot up
your plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, I mean, it's like,
so all you had back in the day was legends
[SPEAKER_00]: and people trading information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why so many of us like look,
look at like Rob Clark's book,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the book Bible for a breeder because
it was lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did he have competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, later on we breeding book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that one, you know,
during that era later on, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg Green had his breeder's Bible,
but that was much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was way, way later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, he was like basically like the
only person on the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to learn how to breed and
how cannabis even worked, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was where you went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got very fortunate that he got so
much of it right for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very fortunate because it could
have been anyone doing that and getting it
[SPEAKER_01]: very wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it probably would have been passed as,
you know, Canon forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just asked me if I have any advice
on greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like pretty general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I've grown in greenhouses for
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, but I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, yeah, there was there,
you know, there was all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was all this experimentation going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like they were looking for harm
in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, nobody knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think when was the first time you
even heard the word CBN or CBG or CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty early on, but I think most
people didn't know the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG and CBN at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, I mean, I like we we
got some like, you know, we used to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it pretend to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got bunked a few times by what we
thought was kind, but it was gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gorgeous hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it looked like four hundred
dollar an ounce weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the but the green Mexican got you
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I remember at that time,
you know, in Chicago or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even I didn't even realize that
hemp had those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't even know that hemp looked
like weed back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I didn't even know that they looked
they could be confused for each other at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we encounter so how we had no
experience with hemp except for when they
[SPEAKER_01]: would bring, you know, this gorgeous
looking fucking reddish, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: frosty indica in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, damn, we're paying the
same price as the Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: School.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretend to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we called it ditch weed in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it grew in ditches and it grew at
the edges of fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a wild population from World War
Two, you know, all through the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I didn't I mean, you know,
now it's like now now I'd know it was up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we were so confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was how how weed that could look
that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you'd smoke it and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking bong head after bong head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I don't feel high at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you smoke a joint of Mexican
and you're like, oh, it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys must have been making a killing
selling that, you know, 60 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing about the thing about my
area was is that there was brown Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything better than that was kind of
that went for expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like the quality only
made the price go up, but it was like even
[SPEAKER_00]: the shitty stuff was still will go by
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what killed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ours, like it would have way less
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was it was really beautiful
looking, but it was it was always the same
[SPEAKER_01]: price as the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would always blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That anyone was so dumb, they'd sell this
for the same price.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, every single time I'd
get fucking skunked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get skunked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's there's an aspect to where
it's like, what's interesting is that so
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know why this is necessarily,
but it does seem like when with testing
[SPEAKER_00]: low THC doesn't get you as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it also seems like once there's
enough THC, it doesn't seem to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when there's too much THC,
it seems to get in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of our like famous elite
strains, at least the ones that I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally like to smoke a bunch,
they seem to come in between 18 and 25
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these like 30 plus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even think like when when THC
testing started, there was almost no 30
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, because there wasn't any there
wasn't any testing selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allowed people to see higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll select those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, without those numbers
there, no one selected those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but how would you really tell a
lot of the stuff that would get you the
[SPEAKER_01]: most?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be the, you know, 14 percenters to
18 percenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, you know, a lot a lot of the,
you know, the sour diesel and the chems
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of those things are like in the
low to mid 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really good chem dog can be as
low as 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be 17 to 22 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it knocks my head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's not that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you need a certain amount of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like nobody had any idea what any TH
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when was THC percentage even a
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not until like, oh, like 2009,
2010, 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collectives are getting popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember even past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a long time before collectives
started posting THC percentages on the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I was smoking for 20 plus
years before there was any verified
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get weed tested for percentages
that you could access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like weed was good because it smelled good
and it worked good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and you wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually can remember pretty well
when Mitch from the Adam Dunn show back
[SPEAKER_01]: when he was one of the main hosts on that
show, he brought on a bunch of the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: labs and it just started popping up and we
were just beginning to understand what a
[SPEAKER_01]: THC standard was, why there was no
consistency between two different labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember he brought them on Iron
Labs, Michigan, SC Labs and a few others,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they ended up all slowly hanging up on
the fucking podcast and the calls because
[SPEAKER_01]: the questions got too fucking complicated
and they didn't want to answer that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it was it was later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely was later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that meant was that for a long
time, almost all breeding selection was
[SPEAKER_00]: done based on your ability to look.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it burn like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it smoke like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think part of the modern problem
with science is you've got people that
[SPEAKER_00]: like think that they can grow by numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just looking at charts and
they're looking for higher THC and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for certain high terpenes and
they're looking for this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the selection of like, I mean,
this sounds really bro, but like the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of like six or seven friends
smoking a bunch of joints and saying what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is often more effective than any kind of
chart so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
it's all about whether or not humans like
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, robots don't smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like it's this weird thing,
too, where like I'm not a musician,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt is, but there's an aspect in like
musical reproduction where like some level
[SPEAKER_00]: of distortion and some harmonics are
better than others.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, did he freeze?
[SPEAKER_01]: He froze up, froze up on a smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's getting a phone call.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I froze up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not back yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had, oh, he left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he must have gotten a phone call or
booted or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I had also had on here one of my
favorites, all reversal sprays,
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time, no matter how many times I
post my spray, someone would chime in and
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one asks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody, you know, it's an assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I remember aspirin for reversals was
another favorite of mine that people would
[SPEAKER_01]: use aspirins for the reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm shocked people don't actually say
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly I just hear colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's what does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what does it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did all of a sudden you had this weird
look on your face and I realized you were
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen and then I was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said basically, thanks for playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an ID message and I was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kicked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to drop some secrets and the
Illuminati stepped in and was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, we're going to change the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking never going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have someone did talk about also in the
comments that I thought was funny and a
[SPEAKER_01]: good one was harvest in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang your plants upside down so the THC
flows to the top of the colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that is that is some bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, strangely enough, you definitely
want to hang your plant upside down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for different reasons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there was there is some weird
stuff that I don't know if it's true or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, where people talk about harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the nighttime harvest, having certain
amounts of dark cycles because they want
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin to be in a certain state when
they harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only thing THC was
supposedly supposedly THC is strongest in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant at in during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the old claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's true or not,
but I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some scientific stuff that says,
yeah, actually, you know, harvesting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the dark is is when it is, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, I don't know the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of this stuff that's going
to get proven or disproven over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and some of it like some of it
like how good is weed or like what does
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing do for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to interpret that how
well we think it's working ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's obviously like not just raw
numbers when it's a consumable that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces an effect on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the end of the day, that's what's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about right is like how that that
effect of once we consume it, however
[SPEAKER_00]: you're consuming it, you know,
and that you can't I don't know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand numbers that lead to specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is you look at and
that's one of the reasons why the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers is so bunk is because I think
there's like a big like misunderstanding
[SPEAKER_00]: about THC percentage and people view it
like it's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like stronger is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's more like, you know,
since there's so many kinds of highs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what's the math?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the math?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the testing that shows you this is
going to be a racy buzz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you want to crawl out
of your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's going to make you
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's going to make you alcohol kind
of has the same effects all the way up,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But weed does wildly different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To everyone, depending on time of the day
where you're smoking type of strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, everything changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said isn't science proof?
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like what's not proof is that THC by
itself detonates how strong a strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a quantifiable science yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: High experience is not quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically, right now, science can
only take it so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a number and humans like
numbers and they like playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one that everybody
recognizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's actually a pretty big movement
to get away from THC numbers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that would take so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're still we're still calling
stuff like I mean, people are still
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, you know, all fucking sativas do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All hybrids do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All indicas do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like we're still at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to remember this one because
this dude just said flushing is a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably actually something
cool to chat about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, one of the things that we
haven't talked about, there was a super
[SPEAKER_00]: bro myth is the is, you know, you can tell
indica versus sativa versus broadleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: versus thinly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see extreme broadleaf,
that's how you know it's more indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see thin leaves, that's how
you know there's some sativa in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there's also a high associated
with each.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see those big broadleafs,
you know, it's going to make you go like,
relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see those thin leaves, you know,
it's going to make you go woo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was that's super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole the whole indica sativa
thing is actually like it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated now because it was like it was
misclassified to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's so used currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see us like changing it any time
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately, not as much as people
are going to push and try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a long time to pick up
because according to like raw science
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, what we would consider sativa,
they would call indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we call indica, they would call
Afghanistan from Afghanistan and Pakistan
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would call it Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we would call what,
you know, like and then what we would call
[SPEAKER_00]: ruderalis, they call sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you got that a little twisted up,
but I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I have it twisted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a little bit twisted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did I twist it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it twisted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sativa would be what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the sativa was hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica was all Afghans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanica was its own thing that was short
stout structured Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ruderalis one that doesn't really
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to look it up because Matt and I
disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, it's sweets and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can what we can definitely say
is that it changed classification wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 30, 40 years ago to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that classification change has not
gotten into our common speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we basically as weed people call
like indica is anything that's like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan, whatever region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sativas are various mostly equatorial
things from around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but that's not how they you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we were talking about it just
the other day where a lot of the highland
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans or Kush's from Hindu Kush are a
lot more thinly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where the like the Baba type
stuff, the more low lying Afghans from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like low elevation or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a lot more widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's because what is it has
something to do with the barometric
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, the the how the leaves
transpire, leaf transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's that last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's related to how the leaves
transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're when you're in a colder,
drier, more UV environment, like a like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain highland valley, you want to have
thinner leaves because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: transpire too much from your pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all the light you need because
you're higher up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the atmosphere is thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need as much you don't need
as big a fan leaves to catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where it's your if you're in a
humid spot or a lowland spot, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have wider leaves because, you know,
so but that that's there's some bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science there where we maybe haven't
gotten all that figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's definitely pure Afghans that
have some fairly thin leaves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pure Pakistanis or near pure
Pakistanis that are pure turpentine,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something you usually see from
case types, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that used to be I mean,
that was the way like if you crossed an
[SPEAKER_00]: indica to a sativa back in the day,
you would look at all the wide types and
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, oh, these lean Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every thin type, you'd be like,
oh, that's an extreme sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might even judge how extreme based
on how tall it was and how thin the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking you were 100 percent right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in reality, there's lanky indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember my first experience with that
was a Lebanese that I got from a
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, wow, it was called Lebanese
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had very narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew one big long cola, but it finished
in seven weeks, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was it was very red and it had a
very narcotic effect at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very confused how this this
narrow leaf thing could possibly be a Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, considered an indica of any
any sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, too, because you think
about the environment of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like they in Afghanistan has a
way wider range of elevation than anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that people grow here, all the way from
basically sea level up to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seven, eight thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they have the Hindu Kush
mountain range is the second biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain range next to the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's seven, eight thousand feet or
six thousand feet or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still mountain valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still peaks that doesn't have
anything on it that go way up above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously the environment there is
going to be way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's asking about Asian wide leaf
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was a Chinese variety or a
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: A camera was called the I know Ace carried
a Chinese Union for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen him, but I have heard that
there are broadly Chinese plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's supposedly where a lot of those
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't experienced them yet,
though, myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just asked, do potatoes grow
underground?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potato trees, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potato that you eat does grow
underground, but that is a big above
[SPEAKER_00]: ground component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I pick mine off trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the kind of fucking potatoes you're
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, technically, you know,
all broadleaf, most broadleaf is Asian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Afghanistan, Pakistan,
that area of China, Turkmenistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, that's all Asia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the heart of Asia, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're referring to Asia proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I mean, it's definitely on
the Asian continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked about ABC, the Australian
Bastard Cannabis, friendly looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's classified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, and this is this is from
CSI, not from my experience, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: what most people would consider a long
flowering, you know, narrow leaf type
[SPEAKER_01]: plant as opposed to what I mean,
it looks short and squat and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: real compact bushy, but it actually is a
long flowering, you know, super to
[SPEAKER_01]: paneling type plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably people, most people would
classify that as sativa or some type like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it you know, as science starts
to study this, it starts to study this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn a lot more about like
how the science impacts what's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like Matt and I danced around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and maybe I'm bad for bringing it up
because we were going to do a whole show
[SPEAKER_00]: on it at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, the difference between not
understanding genetics and not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding real science had a massive
impact when certain companies started
[SPEAKER_00]: offering genetic testing and promises
based on genetic testing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and promising that they could
reveal familial relationships and they
[SPEAKER_00]: could sort of unlock this like oral
history and provide like a factual web of
[SPEAKER_00]: interrelated and interconnectedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got people to pay them and send
them tons of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it ends up being that
mostly what everybody paid for and risked
[SPEAKER_00]: their genetics to send in was never on the
table anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was totally inconsistent data as far as
that goes, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, for it to use humans,
for instance.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics can be like this is 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what we were looking
for with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is your first cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty three and me for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's your great grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your great grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we didn't understand enough
of the science to really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they came out and they made a
bunch of claims and everybody sent them a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of genetics and a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, no one got what
they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unfortunately, we as humans,
we tend to think about plants like humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that we can do, you know,
genetic relational data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find someone based on their cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, like people are being put
in prison based on this kind of data or
[SPEAKER_01]: track down old serial killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants and especially cannabis are
much more complex creatures with
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions based on environment,
things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's they needed a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what you'd say is they needed a
longer read system than they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a short read system and it just
wasn't accurate enough to portray the data
[SPEAKER_01]: they were trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I think it goes back to the bro
science of, well, they had these these
[SPEAKER_01]: different categories like hemp,
like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no blueberry was hemp, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't quite say what to find
these things into these categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were organized by these
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people still reference those as like,
well, it shows mine is obviously more O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush and skunk than, you know,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said 23andMe and compared it
to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you talk genetics for plants
like, you know, we don't understand very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you try to relate it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that you understand some
of.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, oh, I want to I want to
see if Chem 91 is, you know, is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is it Sour Diesel's grandmother
like we think is this related to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the are the are the chems all sisters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they like you want all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, it we didn't get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd almost probably have to take
somebody who was an expert in that
[SPEAKER_00]: relative field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who had our back and our interests at
heart to tell us whether or not the method
[SPEAKER_00]: the methods that they're using and what
they would need to give us the answers
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it ended up taking was someone that
was super precise with their catalog that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably has more history and knowledge
with their own catalog than is more
[SPEAKER_01]: resourceful and sourcing and more anal
about sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To then supply parent, child,
grandchildren and then backwards test it
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if they were able to meet up that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I didn't even bring up
spending a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I didn't even bring up the fact
that like you get multiple different cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that come in all with the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just more talking about like the bro
science of like we have all these stories
[SPEAKER_00]: of how things are related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, you know, like the
suppose like the old Betsy and the bull
[SPEAKER_00]: rider from down there in your neck of the
woods are supposedly sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like we have all these
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, it's like it's like
we're gonna have this like huge industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't have decades of science
behind organizing all this shit the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you would any other big value crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all coming out of the woodwork and
it's a huge fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of liars and a bunch
of hucksters and a bunch of deceitful ass
[SPEAKER_00]: fools trying to lay claim to old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, so somebody gets took on
some seven early 70s Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure from my uncle or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that that gets entered into
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you even know what's real to
start your basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's like when I first
talked to Phylos and I talked to him,
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him and I said, you need you need
to consult with someone and much better
[SPEAKER_01]: than even myself who has a better
collection and understands cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: provenance better than anyone else in the
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not hire them and keep them on
staff, there is no point even doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to start with good base
genetics to be able to develop this
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a reliable source for
Skunk One, a reliable source for Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Light Spy, a reliable source for Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have all that reliable source
for SFEOG, all the different OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without all that reliable source,
everything else is bullshit because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't crowdsource cannabis because most of
the time the most faint cut rises to the
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly they would have a heart
and they they wouldn't be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have this thing where it
would be like, well, these five cuts of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D say this, but then there's these
other weird ones that got sent in and say
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would how would someone know they
would have to hire someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they were all too lazy to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were too cheap and too lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until a company actually does that,
they're going to get nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every company that tries it is going
to spin their fucking wheels because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how cannabis is as a bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about cannabis and
plant genetics to know what the framework
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to even get what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that would be at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: To like judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to we would have to find
somebody that was into that, that knew
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that wasn't going to bullshit us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could look at their methods and their
this and their that and figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I would assume like with
humans, they figured out what the Swedish
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool was like by testing a bunch of
Swedes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they were able to go around
to different human populations and they
[SPEAKER_00]: got enough data that they were able to see
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, because I'm not a
geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think because the human genome
was so thoroughly mapped and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: believe the cannabis genome was thoroughly
mapped yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it's just too expensive to run
these type of tests at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's an aspect where it's
like we have all these oral tales about
[SPEAKER_00]: how things are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no way of discerning if
they're actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time it's been promised so far,
it's been cheating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's it's been very
upsetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And disappointing all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think what most people don't
know is that, like, Filos did shut down
[SPEAKER_01]: their genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are no longer taking in tests
supposedly to do genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, the database, if I'm correct,
is still up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody feels the need, back it up,
because it may not always be up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these people who, you know,
paid for these tests might want that data
[SPEAKER_01]: someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's risky about it is I was just
having a different convo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like now that we're getting
into science and now that we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into legal stuff, a lot of the science
behind it and a lot of this testing and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of this other stuff, people are
nervous because they're worried that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be used to, you know, lock access to
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get the genetic code for
something and you lay claim to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or you use it or, you know,
like Filos had a whole like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: backhand aspect of what they were trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of science, you know,
science isn't just sitting there waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's, you know, science is done by
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those humans can have like a variety
of goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for weed nerds, you're all just
trying to get some like raw science to
[SPEAKER_00]: like answer questions and figure out stuff
you want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing, bro science that's going on
right now that Matt can speak of
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively, okay, is that most reversal
stuff is very bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that there's not hard data on
what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Matt and Caleb and other
friends that do that shit really
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain strains where it's very
likely that a certain amount of of spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is very effective and too much or too
little is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can vary by strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can vary by clone of strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have two clones one inch from
each other and give completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions to the same exact amount of
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the data is so incomplete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the most data is coming
between, you know, guys like me and Caleb
[SPEAKER_01]: or whoever else talking and putting
together our notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the what was the PPM of the
spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of spray were you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the, you know, what was the
constituents of the spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often were you spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a trigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you, you know, there's all kinds of
things that go into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of right now, because controls are
never going to be that good until you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, a multimillion dollar
facility until that's going on and the
[SPEAKER_01]: trials are being done in places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to be keep spinning
our wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so the majority of the of the
seed market right now is feminized,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the American one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very bro science and that it's
observational stuff passed amongst friends
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe some tutorials that you can read
on what to mix and what to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on and so forth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a there's obviously like,
and there's even stuff that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb or Matt has shared with me where
it's like, here's this plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter which one, but here's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've sprayed four different types of
reversal mix on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is the only one that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other all the others failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you use that same spray on on
some other strains and it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly as well as the ones that failed on
the that that plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a big there's probably in
my mind, there's like a vast amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that we are finding that's
holding true is that each different type
[SPEAKER_01]: of spray is as inconsistent as the other,
meaning some that are, let's say someone
[SPEAKER_01]: uses colloidal silver, someone uses silver
thiosulfate, someone uses cobalt chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one is going to be like the cobalt
chloride stuff might be better with like
[SPEAKER_01]: TK, you know, but it's not always going to
be that consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one, each different type of spray
is just as inconsistent as the next
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are so many different
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really fucking hard to
explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just can't quantify it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot quantify it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for the most part, with some rare
exceptions and normal breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have a few males and you can get
an incredibly dense amount of pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeds off of a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making regular seeds is a vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really need that many males,
depending on how big it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting a getting a vigorous and
thorough pollination with with a few
[SPEAKER_00]: simple tricks is quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, reversals are like going into
the casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a bunch of tips and ideas on how to
beat the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're hoping that you come out ahead
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time the best advice I give
everyone is numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more numbers you have, the more of a
chance you have of being successful that
[SPEAKER_01]: round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't afford to lose,
then I, you know, keep a lot of male
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, clones of that or keep a lot of
clones of the same plant reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do several if you can't afford to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, there's there's not that
that that whole area is ripe for a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is there's no there's
no direct money in it right now for that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of experimentation to go on to really
open, unlock that side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just interested breeders sharing
knowledge and guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every breeder, that's the thing you
should realize about all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you buy feminine seed,
you know, I always talk about how,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, breeding is a lot of
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly what I mean is that it doesn't
give you the results in the children that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were hoping for all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's also true is that there's a lot
of failure in reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very, very light pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in addition to that,
in addition to the failure of just normal
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, there's the failure to make
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main problem, like for people that
are wondering what the issue is when we
[SPEAKER_01]: say a failure, what's going on almost
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did the thirteen thousand plant
reversal, I saw three plants in thirteen
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand that didn't reverse at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no male parts that stayed all
female and didn't take any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hormonal treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's three in thirteen thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: To even be able to observe that most of
the time, what you'll see is a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: a female or a female plant you're
reversing will start to form male parts
[SPEAKER_01]: after about three and a half, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the parts will instead of like on most
males where the ball balls will hang as
[SPEAKER_01]: they mature on on a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you reverse it, the balls cluster
hard as if they were a female bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever happens in this action is
where it doesn't allow the male parts to
[SPEAKER_01]: mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't allow them to mature
because it's they're all clustered so
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what exactly causes that
clustering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few tips and tricks like where
you can use gibberellic acid, spray it
[SPEAKER_01]: really lightly and hope that, you know,
the the anthers and everything expand a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and cause a little bit of give
it a little bit more room to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's that's the main action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you'll see balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all the times will the balls open and
drop or mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's like there's an open
drop on a male and then all this pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's like if they're all stacked
every which way tight, then they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: then they don't open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes there's pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friends have had success manually
removing that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get tweezers, you pull it out and you
shake it out in a little bag one by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that we consider that a failure
if you have to do that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or using using various kinds of mesh or
screens or different things and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the pollen separated from the rest of
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't want to fail even more
than you've already failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get at least even if it's
not a sellable amount of seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, well, I at least want some
that I can like run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And test and give to my friends and see
what's in it, because I want to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's a lot of manual
pollination that goes on with with
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal simply because it's all bro
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I can speak to this more than
I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, when reversals first started
happening, when was the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tutorial got posted on one of the
forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was pretty tightly held
information for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wish I did because he
deserves credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the dude I know Fett later posted it
on from Spice Brothers, posted it on
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a basic tutorial on how to make
spray that will be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the two point five or point five,
two point five, I think it was combo of
[SPEAKER_01]: silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate
mixed at, you know, five hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliters a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it in, then nine to one on on the
ratio dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that became where most people started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some people took it further
from there and worked more on the ratio to
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect it for certain types of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strains are more popular now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people stuck with that and still
use that to this day and have effective
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had we have some friends that
have some funny stories that like fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up the dilution ratios early on and
sprayed like way too strong of a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and like half killed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it reversed really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a bunch of leaves died and it
looked all haggard and heinous and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's there's an aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this thing, too,
where like the scientific method is like
[SPEAKER_00]: you do an experiment and then you get
results and then other people are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate that over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if enough people do that, well,
now you've got some accepted science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with the problem with
reversals is someone does something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They write it all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They document just exactly how they did
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody else does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the same plants and they
fail or it doesn't go very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the replication part, we haven't
even gotten to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the these are the factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things you take into account
to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hoping and guesswork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that would even do a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would tell me that sometimes he would
reverse three or four different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have backups and backups and
backups because he he won.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was interested in breeding
with all of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whichever one reversed the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was going to be the males that was used
and that that obliterated some failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because you're trying to
mitigate failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's and I don't know that
that that that like observational bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science isn't changing anytime soon
because I don't know when like corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for science is going to get to
looking at reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a bunch of knowledge on profitable
work to figure out how it works and to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the info open source after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to not just sit on that proprietary
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so how so that that aspect
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all this stuff where like real
science could help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we as grungy weed people access
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something going on right now,
maybe we could talk about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, where it's like I mean, I wasn't
worried about disease at all in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now viroids and dudding and
pathogens have become a massive issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time we had testing for them,
they were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, right, like I got people
texting me all the time about viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's all kinds of posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in all kinds of, you know,
it's like it's going to get to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in the legal market where when
you buy clones, they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have viroid free tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just heard that some little
raton brought a bunch of clones over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona and ruined a bunch of libraries,
serious libraries that were keeping old
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of European strains because,
you know, people people over there are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to import our shitty gelato with
fucking HPLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm to the point now I buy one of
those like 100 pack of razors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm taking cuttings or something,
it's a new it's a new razor every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a lot more precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to just use a razor until it got
dull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two, three hundred cuttings with it
and then it stopped cutting quite as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and pop a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back to what we were talking
about the broscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone just asked if reversals were
normal back in the day when I would,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, debate people about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would point out really quickly that
actually we we as humans have tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed out the intersex trait and the
intersex trait is actually standard in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically, reversals are bringing it
back to where it was and more natural than
[SPEAKER_01]: what we have done by humans breeding
intersex traits out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, because I mean, that was the big
thing was like people, oh, you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something so unnatural to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're ruining it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ruining it because it's unnatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always point out, you know,
actually we're we're moving into back to
[SPEAKER_00]: more natural and intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on that with like the the
Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with Hermes seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ruining the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of prejudice because
people thought that you were permanently
[SPEAKER_00]: altering the cannabis, the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing this cheating thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've mentioned it before on previous
podcasts, but up until the late 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 90s, seedless weed really wasn't
very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all weed was seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if a plant had a bunch of
hermaphrodites, oh, well, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of males anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all that tie, all that this all
that hash stuff, they didn't care as much
[SPEAKER_00]: if it got, you know, like it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just Hermes weren't that big of
a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few seeds here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to beat the fuck out of it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to beat the fuck out of it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the smoking cultures,
the Colombian, the Panamanian,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jamaican, all that most of that came
chock full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few more seeds from Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it any different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was when we started trying to
grow seedless that we were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, there's this built in trait to
cannabis that we don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is it doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you allow this to exist and threaten my
room of pure?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's like the most
unnatural thing in the world is what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we grow it for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're denying it what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cush triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's got some triangle
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very strong, but it actually
smells exactly like fucking sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got sidetracked people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do get regular males on reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, yes, but I don't think they
test male like if you were to sex test
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would sex test female.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just expressing male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will need to understand the
difference between expressing and and
[SPEAKER_01]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I did like a 13000 seed pop of CSI
work, which you're familiar with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that, we probably got out of
that 13000 seeds, we probably got about I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, 80 to 100 observational full
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No female flowers, full pollen,
not hermaphrodite, not hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, full balls,
full everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, you know, that's
obviously not that many out of out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're we're playing a
little Dr. Frankenstein with with plants
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like they just want to you
know, they're not they're they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding isn't to provide us with what we
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make seed for the next
generation and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone said, no, they would not test
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would test female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's observationally what we've
seen so far anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a certain percentage and
then, you know, it's not so much the to
[SPEAKER_00]: us, it's not so much the method you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that does the plant have it in
its genes or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the reasons why,
for instance, you guys don't see a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of diesel S ones on the market is because
diesel is famously hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's some things that harm,
but almost never will successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some things that reverse like
a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and there's some things that
reliably reverse nine times out of ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of those times it won't drop
any pollen and you'll fucking smash your
[SPEAKER_01]: balls in a drawer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 13,000 seed hunt was in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we did we did a 13,000 plant
reversal and made a few million seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like hunting 13,000 seeds isn't that
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a luxury for someone to be able to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the I was I was helping on
one of the bigger farms in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is there is an explosion now of
80 acre, 40 acre, 25 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this that everything else,
those 13,000 plants, they took up about
[SPEAKER_00]: seven acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also the factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I saw this with the seed
pop at the at the hemp place and
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing is a bitch when you do 13,000
plants because someone's got to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't it wasn't there was a lot of
non-ideal things about that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: project for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people get excited and money does what
money wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I mean, even even even growing out
three or four hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to objectively test the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at some point you're you're
going to you're going to start missing
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, as as as Caleb likes to say,
just look for the runtiest, shittiest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most nastiest production plant you've ever
seen and let your smokers try that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be the clear top five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that you're hoping doesn't taste
and smell and smoke like it actually does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the beastly production
plants, they'll be like, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone just brought in
something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll jump on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys cover bro science of male
selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't we haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of bro science with male
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one thing that I am asked as a
seed maker is what do you look for in your
[SPEAKER_01]: males, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and that's the assumption that I only
look for certain traits in males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they have those traits,
then I use them, which is a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: percent how I don't do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually start with an idea, an end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want a plant that's going to be,
let's say, strawberry and have pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: dense structure and kind of short and
squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, I will think of different
lines where I can achieve that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: select a male that has the traits that I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how each project is done and
achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different, different male for different
female for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some bro science that I would
classify that I don't know has been
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically proven is if it showed
flowers in veg, you chuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes people would even
torture like this is some bro science
[SPEAKER_00]: where you'd be like, I'm going to torture
this male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep a cutting of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow out way too big in a
solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let it drought three or four
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to beat it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do weird shit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the testing males aspect was,
was a big popular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People used to say on the forums,
I'm going to, I'm going to stress test my
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stress test these females and
see what we can do to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I was, I always had an opposite
point of view on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, I don't want people to
grow my plants like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they grow them like shit,
of course they're going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the point of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the stress testing males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you throw any male in a fucking
tiny little cup, it's going to fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower 99% of the time, you know,
there's an aspect where the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: desperate to do what it's supposed to do,
which is make seed and produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you beat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of them might panic
and be like, no matter what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do what I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we should, we should,
and this is something that we might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend on at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but he goes by the handle on
IG of 707 seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them Shawbud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was one of the guys he would
reverse males and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he wanted to see what the resin
production and what the turps were and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the smoke was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a female plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do the same thing, but I wouldn't
smoke them because there usually wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: enough smokable content to make it worth
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get an idea for, for the terpene
production of the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, when, when I ran the progeny
from said male, I would be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify, Oh, this is coming from the
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just another way of trying to
get information because I think Matt calls
[SPEAKER_00]: it the shotgun method, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a lot of times you don't really know
you have some observational things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it short?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it flower early?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does its flower custers look, look sexy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use that one and then you got
to grow out seeds and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: did this pass the traits that I want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Neville and other guys that
like grew up in the era of all male female
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, you know, finding the male was
the biggest bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding the one that would consistently
pass the traits that you want to the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the whole game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still the biggest bitch in the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even though reversals are
technically harder because of the failure
[SPEAKER_01]: rate, I think that breeding wise,
it's much easier, easier to select a
[SPEAKER_01]: female from observable traits than it is a
male knowing what observable traits he'll
[SPEAKER_01]: pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could use Neville as another
example, just because it's super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, when he went to jail in
1990, one of his crew found this cut in a
[SPEAKER_00]: NL five Hayes and skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a sea of turpentine and
cat piss and weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found this one amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he, when he started working
at Sensei, they started breeding and he
[SPEAKER_00]: started trying to find different skunk
Hayes males that he would cross to his
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite NL five Hayes females to get that
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what Jack Herrera came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he still wasn't happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they worked on it for two or three more
years with Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the mango Hayes and the
Neville's Hayes and the, and the super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver Hayes came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole time the moms never changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time consuming process was,
was choosing four or five males and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it separately to each female and
then growing out the progeny and seeing if
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny was worth the shit and gave it
what it wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, he didn't even
like breeding with female Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought that the magic to Hayes was in
the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that and I'm an admitted big
Neville fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even I will say that, uh, two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that, uh, the males are what he
ended up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to say, well, this Hayes C,
this was the clear winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one we should have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, one of the things that's
interesting is when you're growing out
[SPEAKER_00]: some 18 or 20 or 22 weeks of Teva thing,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, collecting pollen and then pollinating
a room of much more skunk Indica females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot easier timing than timing
pollen drop to use a female, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so those 22 week long fucking flowering
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those 22 week long flowering seeds
contained within the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, what it sounds like to me is
that he had some amazing females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just lost them and didn't realize
what he had until they were fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a, I haven't seen a lot
of pictures of, of original Hayes of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants where people are like,
this is the fucking one of original Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the, you know, there was a lady
named, uh, hazy lady and you might be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to find her picture still on Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of the only people I saw that
consistently grew the positronics Hayes
[SPEAKER_01]: 19, uh, from Palm Hill that consistently
grew it beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can say it was a beautiful Hayes
grow, but rarely, rarely if ever did I see
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful Hayes females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's an aspect there where
it's like what it sounds like he even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, after four or five years of
having Hayes sounds like Neville ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: with literally one living plant that he
could work with in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was Hayes seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense for old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and, uh, and,
but it sounds like if he knew what he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: he probably would have kept all of them
alive and been more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, by the time he realized how
special it was, he'd fucked it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody wants to talk about the 56 day
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some aspects of it that I don't
like, but the, the story is as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as generally as I can, as I can say is
that it was called something else in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from, it was, it was from
within that, uh, that, uh, Kush crew down
[SPEAKER_00]: in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some aspect and that Kush cut and those
cush is, it was worth a lot of money and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of shit going around with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something happened with that cut where
there was some violence, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody fled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cal and came to the Bay, uh,
with that cut and they didn't want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it what it actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were trying to figure out because
they wanted to grow it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were trying to figure out like,
what can we do so we can grow and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut, but it's not going to create any
more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to follow us from down there
because what happened down there was
[SPEAKER_00]: hella, hella sketch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they decided, uh, um, you know,
uh, they decided to rename it headband.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, and we, I don't know for
sure what it was called before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's the nicest Kush type
plant that I know, like of actual Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or what we would consider a Kush
type, like the SFV or the, or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know, like it's the most
potent to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometime in the, you know,
oh four or five or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's slipped out in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how some other people that have
it have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call it the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a huge debate about when to
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to take it long,
like 10, 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but a lot of people like to take it at
eight or nine weeks and they feel it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the most potent then weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you the highest high and like
the, the edginess and the raciness and the
[SPEAKER_00]: all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's got some mystery, you know,
there's some names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously like there's,
there's the different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think Duke would call it the rest
stop Kush, cause that's where he got it
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's the 50, 60 people called the
murder cut and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people tried to,
um, some people try to, to push it as,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, it's the original New York
city headband, which we now know is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally false.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, to me, like when it
comes down to it, I would classify it as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as things I hold it's in the top three
or four potency wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually pull it between eight and nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days, 59 days, 63 days, something
along, something along, something along
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that level, you know, it probably
has other names, other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few people out there that might
know the, the, the first name,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it is, it's a really pure OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that I tend to use in all
the, the, if I have anything marked
[SPEAKER_01]: headband, that's 99% of the time what I'm
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause his homie had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now, now we know that,
you know, the original headband is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mama sour, um, and, uh, was a very diesel
type fluffy, you know, uh, Fox taily type
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these couple cuts that are floating
around that are, that are called headband,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and, uh, you know, they're not,
they're most, most things that are called
[SPEAKER_00]: headband are really great weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a few that are really,
really, really great OG Kush types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not related to New York,
which doesn't, you know, it might fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with some people's stories, but it doesn't
change how nice the cut is itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to be, um, yeah,
it's, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's saying it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my LA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Loompa's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the 707.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not even a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was renamed headband because whatever
name it had before was sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's just called headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called the 56 mostly as an identifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you have to, you have to figure
out some tag that allows, uh, that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to identify stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, before the internet,
we just called a chem dog dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't need it to be skunk VA cut or
chem 91 or like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all internet names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that people can communicate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same thing with the 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gorgeous OG Kush type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly potent, super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's probably the best Kush I know of,
you know, and it has a mysterious origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for someone's question, is there
somewhere you can review this if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: missed the live feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, on the riot seeds, the account I'm on,
not right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed cover, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can go, there's a little tab area
where there's a little play button.
[SPEAKER_01]: You click that and you can see all the
videos that we've uploaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people are asking if we're going
to have the audio podcast back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my best to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably need some help with someone
going and extracting the audio,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, portions of all of these shows for the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so someone's really good with the
audio and you guys can extract that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would help a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd really like to get the audio
podcast back up and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to learn some stuff on the fly to
keep this shit going, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do our best to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we've been trying to do these
lives every Friday and be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I know a bunch of people like to
listen to them on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sorry, uh, that it got delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got a bunch of them up,
uh, uh, and then at all of a sudden it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are described the flavoring of the
56.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that the 56, uh,
has the best Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it is that kind of Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a bunch of lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the ones it's, it's pretty,
it's got earthy, but it's got that like
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy type, like mouth coat type thing,
you know, but it's got rare potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I'm not kidding, when I say
it's like, it's, I mean, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, if someone told me it was in their
top one or two favorite cuts, as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's in the top four or five
things that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does this, even though it's,
even though it's very cushy, it's got this
[SPEAKER_00]: weird anxiety thing, you know,
uh, some people won't smoke it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives them massive anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets, it gives me hella anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those people that there's
like, there's friends of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: their wives and stuff like that,
Matt and others, like it gives it like
[SPEAKER_00]: tweaks them out and makes them
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unhappy high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, doesn't do that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets me hella baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for some people it triggers them
and it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you always say after you wake up from
a nap, after smoking it, that your asshole
[SPEAKER_01]: hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I don't know what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the company you keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cal, what can you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you say, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of those, it's a,
it's, it's one of my favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a really nice, it's a really nice
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it, uh, it's, it can be a
finicky OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's aspects where I,
uh, um, there is no difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 and skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different monikers for the
same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: James loud asked me that you got the chem
91 or you got the skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's more than one cut that
floats around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what, you know, uh,
there's that, but, but all those names
[SPEAKER_00]: originate from one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, so there's an aspect
too, where it's like getting back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: real science could tell us one day what
the 56, how closely it's related to other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take the oral history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of the, and some of that
mystery, you know, and, uh, and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is no answer to which one is
better dear 91 because it's personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say both of them are in
my all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, uh, some people would
say the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like them, you know,
um, but you know, there's, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect where, and I'm going to ask this
TK, the original Kush, I think TK is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely one of the original hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is we don't know how
many, we don't know what it is or exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it came from very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that there might've been more
than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that most Kush are bag seed
or S ones from those originals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't know exactly how many
different originals there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there was a lot of bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds of bag seeds and sisters of sisters,
you know, and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another thing that,
that real science could explain to us
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps one day, you know, um,
I actually think to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be controversial and people
might get pissed at me, but I think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that the, the, the Kush that Josh D
and Matt and those guys brought to LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is, is likely lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean like, lost like nobody
has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like the chain of custody got
fucked up enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's, it's that it's really hard
to prove that this specific one is
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person has had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like, it's,
it might be out there as SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be out there as 56 day headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be out there as this,
the, the ghost of today is not the ghost
[SPEAKER_00]: of yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple SFV cuts that flow it out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many renames and so much stuff
happened in LA and the original people
[SPEAKER_00]: lost it and got it back and stuff that
like, I think it might still exist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but under different monikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, and then we had,
um, certain companies like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would make certain strain names like
their seed lines would be SFEOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now a bunch of people are growing their
seed lines and then they have cuts of
[SPEAKER_01]: things called SFEOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's 3000 SFEOG cuts all claiming
to be the original, you know, we did that
[SPEAKER_01]: with Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did it with Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did it with several.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the provenance on those are just
damn near impossible now to go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two or three SFVs that are
popularly traded amongst people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's an aspect where it's
like the TK at least you have really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have some pretty good chain of
custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cornbread Ricky sent it,
but even before he moved to California,
[SPEAKER_00]: sent it to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he brought it with him and it
doesn't appear to have gotten lost by the
[SPEAKER_00]: original crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still good chain of custody on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Josh cut or, you know,
the, the Matt Bubba cut or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one got a little lost in the
wave of the OG movement in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people can say the 92 is that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Kush cut is that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kush cut is that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the ghost, the real ghost is that
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SFV that I have is that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put those four cuts in the
room and you grow them all out next to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and they're not the same week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those people are wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they're the same cut brought to
completely different environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: completely, you know, found a whole
different way of expressing and now move
[SPEAKER_01]: back in to the same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all express totally differently until
they're acclimated to that environment
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's another major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA was like the perfect microcut,
like to blow up in LA and to be worth that
[SPEAKER_00]: much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a culture that fronts so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from like one cut showing up from
these Florida guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To like clubs full of only OG within 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several dozen OG cuts at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, is the flow rider that I have,
is that a sister to the stuff that Josh
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a sister to TK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same as the original Josh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, I've grown it next to the real TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, but it goes back to the
expression thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe it is the same exact cut and
they're just expressing totally
[SPEAKER_01]: differently because they've been moved to
two different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hard part is that that's why I do
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I, I have a hard time with
acclamation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow things to see what they are
side by side in the same room,
[SPEAKER_00]: same environment, same food, same
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure that taking it to
Hawaii for four years does some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it does a genetic change,
but I think expression is expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's, that's for
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, I'm not saying I'm not
disagreeing with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like, this is another
aspect where we just don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, like the, the, the first
thing that really taught me this was
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a clone that I had run out many
times and every time I'd run it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: it smelled like funky foot cheese and get
it back from a great source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got Barry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time I grow it,
I've got one clone, Barry, one clone fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: next to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, what is, is this just these
little micro expressions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, with CSI, that was one
of the ones that really you pointed out
[SPEAKER_01]: the environmental expression is
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just can't make any kind of
conclusions based on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you've gotten the same clone,
supposedly from different sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't make any conclusions about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Them being the same kind of not because of
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I was saying about wanting
to grow the same plant in the same room or
[SPEAKER_00]: the same greenie or the same environment
with the same food at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think that makes sense,
but over, you know, a period of a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, I think it would take for it to
reactivate to the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes it really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it fucking way hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it even more confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to make any kind of claim on
whether something is or isn't something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, you know, but there,
there are, when you grow them side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side, it's not like you have to only wait
on the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be like, Whoa, these leaves are a
different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serrations are looking slight or
looking different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's other observational things
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I do believe like I
actually, I actually got, um, I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: got a chem 91 cut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, uh, simply because, uh,
I wanted to grow it right next to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they've been grown and held and
kept separately for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're, they're vegging and I'm
growing them next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't blew them out yet, but I'm
curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I, I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the exact same cut and I know
who's held it and how long and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but they've been in completely
different environments for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I'd wonder too is like,
as one of them been in a place where they
[SPEAKER_01]: use harsh chemicals for a long time of,
you know, many years and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all that stuff, environment,
you know, like I even wonder sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, sometimes you get,
you get a weak plant or you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: accident or something and you have to save
a plant or you get a plant that's in bad
[SPEAKER_00]: health and you have to nurse it back for a
while because it went through some hell or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, how does that change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get it back perfectly healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, are there the same cuts
floating out there of the same plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just going to be younger and healthier
because they didn't get the tar beat out
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say, you know, I know,
I know I've had, um, OGKB and then I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had OGKB from a source that kept it super
fucking healthy with Matt elite's cut
[SPEAKER_01]: where I never seen it express grow as fast
or or have the turps that it did,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was definitely the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even talking about just so
people know, like I'm not talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: dudding or HP, you know, or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about two things that we
know are the same that go their own path
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one, you know, it's the same cut,
but are they all of equal health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they stack the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they smell the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they look the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there drip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to me for drift,
people say, Oh, genetic drift is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is, but I don't know that
it's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know what epigenetics is,
but I don't think we fully understand
[SPEAKER_01]: epigenetics and how they apply to cannabis
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's what most people refer
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll say for sure that my LA,
my headband cut, it's definitely gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: more sensitive inside over the years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used, you know, 15 years ago,
the thing was an indoor beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes there's a weird thing where
I almost wonder, I almost had this thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, well, what if I went back to
single ended hortiluxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just turned into a beast again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that we updated the lights and it
doesn't like the new lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you're like, Oh,
I got old back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it and it looked like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you change a bunch of shit and
you're like, Oh, it doesn't look like that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be any of the changes I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be interesting to know though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, but then you're like some little
guy or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, where do you, where do you
get the opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get to do these different
environmental experiments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see if things are the same cut or
the same this, or like maybe they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I did this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this experiment where I grew some
headstache under only ceramic metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the shit before, but the dog
shit, which I normally take 12 plus weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: was done in 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cut the chem 91 down at 85 days and
it still had white hairs all over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like was the longest I've ever taken
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally take it 68 or 70 or something
like that, but it was like a full two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks longer than I've ever taken it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still didn't look done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all, that was the only thing that
was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same room, same food, same this same hose,
water, ring, everything, same organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did some stuff not purple too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I didn't actually have any purple
stuff in that, in that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, what I tried to do is I grew some
stuff I knew really well, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: headband and the chem D and five or six
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew them under the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing the rest of the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew those same strains in the
same room, but like in a corner where
[SPEAKER_00]: there was only ceramic metal halides I had
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the only difference that they were
getting was the spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came out way, some things didn't
come out very different than each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few strains were like way
fucking different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember telling Caleb that I
pulled the, the fucking dog shit at 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and he laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started sending him pics and being
like, don't you think it's done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, am I going to lose you again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we're delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked weird for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I fucked now or is he fucked?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's me or you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might be you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's me, but yeah, there's,
so I can think of all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: different experiments and Matt's thinking
of different experiments too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enacting all of those to eliminate
variables is a time consuming money bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the hole you're pouring shit
into to try to learn more about a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all of my, my experiments that I
ran over the years were all based around
[SPEAKER_01]: weather or reversals and whether something
to do with purples and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the funny thing was I became
obsessed with and convinced that metal
[SPEAKER_01]: halide must be the way to get the purples
to express the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much later on I learned that that was
probably the most opposite and stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroscience theory I could have had
because it actually reduces the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: purples you'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have, and I don't think
like, you know, I've been posting on my
[SPEAKER_00]: stories the last few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend did some, grew out some of my
sour, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted people to see it and it
started some convos or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really, I think the diesels
are such a close family that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really think that you can compare
them unless you grow them in the same room
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the same greenhouse or the same
outdoor, the same, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think like you were talking
earlier, I don't think you can take two
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different environments and
different regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put that in a jar and be like,
is this the same weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what gives the most perp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is just trying to coax the
genetics to do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some genetics just give it and it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, even just figuring out all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff is, some of this stuff
is, you know, it's very observational,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to Phylos, Phylos thought
every cut of fucking sour diesel they sent
[SPEAKER_00]: in was the exact same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-O-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-O-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was growing out a bunch
of these diesel cuts next to mine and next
[SPEAKER_00]: to the headbands and stuff to try to
figure shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were obviously different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, some had light green leaves,
some had dark green leaves, some had
[SPEAKER_00]: different serrations, some had different
maturity rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stacked different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, dude's asking,
is it the sour I grew up with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if it somehow ended up
with me and I saved it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that I haven't lost it in over
two decades.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I can say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, time will tell, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I even just got sour from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I want to grow it next to
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C, just do the side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 99% sure his is the same one that me
and Pip and everyone else all use and
[SPEAKER_01]: archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the chocolate is that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I call Choco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's not that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, and so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, I thought for the
longest time I helpfully called it sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will be like, well,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought when I gathered up all those
sours, I would be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, okay, I got ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got NYCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Joe B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Choco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, you know, I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's none of those.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then none of them were my headband
cut either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was figuring at least some.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that it did seem,
it did seem like the Choco and the ECSD
[SPEAKER_00]: were the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the versions of them that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the first person to call it Choco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was only because I saw Choco's
picture and I was like, hey, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, which one, which, which sours are
you running?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that looks like Choco's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, it was always labeled ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny is that it wasn't until
like, if it wasn't for Matt and Pip and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our other close friends,
I probably wouldn't have done that
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they kept bugging me about what
sour I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know there was so many
because I got it so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just never got another one because I had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would I trade for sour diesel when
I have a nice sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize that it was,
you know, that there was so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know it was the fucking Amherst?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you, did you try that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That Amherst?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the Amherst and the
upstate New York and the real,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like four or five names that I
don't, that Matt can probably verify that
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't think they existed five
or 10 years ago as a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, there's a ton of new
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different amount of,
there's a certain amount of new names,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that have come out and there was
a decent amount of names in the forum era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't know, like I just
lived in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the sour in 2000 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had it a couple, a couple of decades
now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that was sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was an era where almost
everyone's sour diesel was Soman's New
[SPEAKER_01]: York city diesel for a long time in the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of the shit people were turning up
with as sour was NYCD grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunter, Hunter Mountain, bruh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't even know, like,
you know, I'm not even dissing Hunter
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain or this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that they weren't names in
common usage amongst traded cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so, you know,
and there, it seems like there was
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple phenos of sour even to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then it became the most
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to, trying to declare the one,
the original, the only sour is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: redundant now that we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're pretty, pretty convinced
that there were at least two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: sours going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two or three diesels, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, I can say, you know,
that when I got it and that we've held it
[SPEAKER_00]: since, and honestly, you know,
back then in the early 2000s or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I didn't ask for all that lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask of where it came from and how
it got there and all that different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like trying to figure that out 15,
20 years later is a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got it then, you know, and I have
this thing where it's like, if I like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, I'll try to hold on to the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not it becomes popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens to most people is they
get rid of anything that's not popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they try to get it back and it's
not the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why everyone's like,
where's the real granddaddy perps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the real this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the real, now it's, where's the
real sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was asking about sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the, the sour across the blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good for a regular sour seed
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of berry comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archives got some amazing sour crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI has got amazing sour crosses and top
dogs got amazing sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and now that it's gained in
popularity, there's a bunch more people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming out of the woodwork with
labeled sours and they're all old and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think skunk VA probably has some
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's who I'd recommend because
there are so many people coming out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: woodwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know who to trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking about the spyrox sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spyrox sour isn't sour spyrox.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's sold through some
nurseries out on the West Coast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad cut, but it's, it's some,
it's some sour cut across the Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were going for like sour
stretchiness, but like more density,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's some hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an, it's not a real sour cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's asking about skunk text diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him the day record diesel,
but his, what he calls the original diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: came from someone else for our last,
or probably the last time we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it came from someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the day record diesel that
he's referring to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it came from his buddy,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dude got diesel, you know,
uh, back on the East coast, back when,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, diesel was slang for fire weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not even sure how it's related or
whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he just got it as, I mean,
the only reason why he calls it original
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel is the guy that gave it to him is
because that's the diesel he got first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that I passed him the day record
as original diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I saw him post that and say,
you got it from that dude, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turned out, yes, he did get a
different cut for someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did get a different cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the name game, you know,
and it's like, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at some of these things,
you see people making all kinds of claims
[SPEAKER_00]: about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from all that because I
got my cut in 2000 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, which is a long ass time ago now,
but it's still, you know, it's still years
[SPEAKER_00]: after it was, it was popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it on the West coast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even old enough to have been
around for when sour was first getting
[SPEAKER_01]: popular and being from the West coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, uh, it, um, like it's kind of
like me, you know, I don't know me trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that I would know what a real sour
was or the original sour was this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I compare all sour diesels to the sour
diesel cut I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not because I, I'm like all like,
Oh, mine's the best or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mostly because that's my comparison
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sour that I had forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I consider to be sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, is it the, I don't know,
you know, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, people are asking about the original
diesel in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So archive his original diesel is the
shroomy diesel, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that we have as original
diesel is just the day record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because it's shroomy diesel,
the Amish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shroomy diesel by Amish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And original and then there's day record
original and direct original is my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, it's one of the most
potent, uh, cuts that I have and potent
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, so all I can say is that most
people don't keep things unless it's
[SPEAKER_00]: popular and it's easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold onto things that I like,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I held onto that sour, even when it
was really unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, how did the good
sour go away?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause nobody wanted to hold most good
cuts go away because people aren't willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold them when they're not popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone wants them back as soon
as there's money to be made and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: rep to be had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so then, so how, how does that
all work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they only want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, I could spread out my diesel
and if no, and if, if in five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody was into sour, a tiny percentage of
heads would keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happened to green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what happened to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit's a lot of shit's gone that,
I mean, there was another cut the other
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone hit me up and asked for forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a forum?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean forums missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I can't find forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, we can't find forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a whore cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people and I'm not making,
if anyone's listening and this is you,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, man, I want that real sour
diesel from like back in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you think about it and it's
like, that's not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, you know, we don't know what
you cut skunk tech sour is identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: sours is really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like, it seems like at
the very least what you can say by people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying my sour right now is that
it's not very well circulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not one of the common named cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ring, my ring's going to keep going off
nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could probably try to end it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is driving me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are an hour and 50 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, we can do, we tried to
talk a little bro science and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and ended up on cuts, but that's the
hardest part for me as a collector is that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody wants to fucking help me back shit
up when shit's unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody wants it when they can
make some money off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes back to nobody wants to
help you back it up because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unpopular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to enter the most abundant
time of the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people can hear me or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Matt and I seem to be on different,
different wavelengths again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just looked delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you want to cover
before we close it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can close it up this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept everybody entertained for an hour
and 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there, yeah, there's a,
there's a thing where we are going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the podcasts up on podcast format
so more people can listen and hear them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody know you can listen to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch the live feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't have the comments, but you can
always go back and listen to the live feed
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Riot Seeds Instagram under the
video section.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this you can replay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always leave these ones up with me and
not so always up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one of them that I did when I
covered when Matt wasn't able to make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on my page, I do have one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody is really good at audio
extraction and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need someone to help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see if we can get the audio ones
back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go check out the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go shoot the shit all the time on the
discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we do most of our dirty work
is on the discord and talk and nerd out
[SPEAKER_01]: and fillet each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, go to riotseedcode.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bunch of new packs to add in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the sites down right now,
but it should be back up very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone have a great night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
