[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_02]: Natsodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get started too much,
I gotta tell you, Francis, you tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: either cut off your head or your chin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you do have a very like
long, oval-shaped head, but still like try
[SPEAKER_01]: to back up off the camera a little bit,
so that don't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not good, but every now and again,
you'll like reach in and it'll be like
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awkward moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what really hurts me is that like if
I put on my glasses, it's like a really
[SPEAKER_00]: awkward distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't see that well without them,
but then if I put them on, I have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like way far back and that's awkward too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sorry, you know, I'm like all
sweaty and don't have phones and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I'm a cultivator,
not like a show personality like you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just left the garden seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to most shows, Matt and I are
pretty bare bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make the content speak for
itself rather than like all the fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: accoutrements that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby and I used to go to so many concerts
together and we would often have like
[SPEAKER_00]: joints of like dog and super dog and
different hybrids with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to the point where like often
people would like that were standing next
[SPEAKER_00]: to us, it would smell so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would want to share it with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And him and I used to have these like
running debates if we should like share or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, because we had literally been at
events where like we shared a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: and like people's knees would buckle
because they got way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like security would have to come
and like help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, we got to the point where
because I can tell some stories like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you know, like the dog
was like, I mean, it still is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it was really a lot stronger than
what most people had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a certain tolerance to it,
but there was a lot of people that like
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three hits and like they'd be in a
space they were a bit uncomfortable in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start by telling a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start by telling a story when the
chem dog ruins somebody's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to a blues traveler concert at
the Greek theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I believe it was 1991.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, can't be sure, but it was in the early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to see blues traveler when they
were just a bar band in New York City,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, playing like small clubs of like
50 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, then they got big and they
opened for Jerry and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're playing the Greek theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went to the Greek theater early
to wait online, to get in, to get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you're out from out
here, you know, the Greek theater is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally general admission, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm, you know, waiting online and
I'm talking to people and I meet somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, I'm smoking online,
which I always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy, you know, he asks,
man, can I try that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he takes a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Takes another hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went from being this like really
excited, like jovial character to like
[SPEAKER_01]: just completely like, and not saying
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, he got so high that when the
show let in, like he sat down before the
[SPEAKER_01]: line went in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the show let in, he didn't go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're letting us in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just sat there and I'm like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he waited online for hours to get a
good spot at the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't know if he ever made it
in because he got so high from two hits of
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had this other experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was that Phil did a show at the,
not the maritime hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was called the maritime hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Philharmonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a singalong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought my camera and I was taking
pictures at this show and of course I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this lady behind me asks if she can
hit my joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let her hit the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder at this point, cause I had
already had this experience with a few
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, Oh no, I smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she takes a couple of hits off the
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I've been taking pictures and I got
this like film camera around my neck,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with a strap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing I know, she collapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like falling on top of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spin around and when I spin around,
spin around, my camera spins around and
[SPEAKER_01]: clocks are in the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like a one,
two punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down from the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my camera clock and she had to
get taken to like rock bed over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, what is she on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, so, so yeah,
I've had a number of times when I shared
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog with people and it didn't go
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while I started just telling
people, like Francis said, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'd be like, no, sorry,
you know, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just makes them want it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people, people thought people thought
we were being dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Gabby and I would be having these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are we going to ruin this person's
experience by being cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like an on, it happened
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Telling everyone I'm stingy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 5,000 people, you know,
on discord that Gabby is fucking just
[SPEAKER_01]: stingy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding onto it all, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard this part,
Gabby, but I have mentioned a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: how like when we were doing all of those,
when we were making those like super dog
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and we were playing around and we
were doing all those outcrosses and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby was honestly like one of the people,
like earliest people amongst my entire
[SPEAKER_00]: friend crew that sort of saw like the
future American seed sales coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to talk to me and be like,
dude, we could, we could take this eight
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter, you know, cause we did big seed
runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we take this eight lighter and
he's like, we could make so many seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with this eight lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just blow anything you could do
with flour out of the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could sell so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, this was, I don't know when it was
probably early two thousands or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long before, you know, seed
companies in America and IG made it like
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, like we'd get into arguments
and I was like, I don't see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how we'd be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how we'd be able to have
customers, all these take money and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these people that we couldn't,
no, we couldn't at the time, but you were
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw what was coming and I was like,
no, it's not, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like 10 years later, I was like,
man, we were just like too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business models that are built on volume
and there's business models that are built
[SPEAKER_00]: on scarcity, you know, and the margins are
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have huge volume,
you can have smaller margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you've got big volume,
if you've got big margins, you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: huge volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's crazy because it's kind of
the same thing with clones right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: except it's more like people taking
advantage, like selling shit for like,
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,500 a piece that's just like a garbage
cross that, you know, just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: made a good name for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like at the Emerald Cup, people will
be waiting online for like the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup to pay $1,500 for clones that
ended up having virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it was just, you know,
I mean, it's part of it is successful
[SPEAKER_01]: branding and then not being honorable
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sucks because I think it's a
flawed business plan because as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you build up your business to the point
where like you have all these people that
[SPEAKER_01]: respect you and think that you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you fuck
everybody and the word gets out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's so much worse now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot of stories about deals that
went bad with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if you want to cut
this out because I ain't trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk shit about people,
but you know, he had contracts with people
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had to give them, like they had to
give a certain dollar amount for their
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and their crop got completely ruined
because it was all virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still wanted his money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, like he destroyed these
people's livelihood by giving them like
[SPEAKER_01]: infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying he did it on purpose,
but like you give people infected genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you sue them for not giving you
the 200 bucks that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, and meanwhile,
these people couldn't get 300 bucks or 400
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks for like quality herb that was,
you know, yeah, it was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing is, is like Francis and
I said, the seeds are so cheap,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you have a problem, like this is
an opportunity to show people that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: solid or that you're a scammer.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could have happened to anyone that,
you know, the seeds are no good,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need to be like, look,
we stand behind, you know, our name and
[SPEAKER_01]: our product and anyone that bought that is
going to get, you know, not just their
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds replaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get extra stuff and yeah,
wasting their time, make the customer feel
[SPEAKER_01]: good because in the end, the seeds don't
cost you shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and like you took so much into
making your reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you just screw so many people over,
let the whole world know that that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible and fuck over your entire
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run into this all the time, Gabby,
when we chat, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times I will talk in generalities
about like certain things that go on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community, because even just telling
stories that are true, people get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you mention, like when we,
if I mentioned somebody's name
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically as an example, their friends
will like cut out that 15 second clip and
[SPEAKER_00]: send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have like furious people in
my DMS all mad that I'm like trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: like fuck with their wallet or destroy
their way of life or like disparage them
[SPEAKER_00]: in some fashion, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I want to say,
that's not really a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was not so dog or
someone else in the discord that said that
[SPEAKER_01]: what people appreciate me is that I didn't
flex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I thought about it and I
said to myself, I'm not opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: flexing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For shit that actually I can flex about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel, I don't feel like I'm that
responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other things that I'm so much
more proud of, like my hydro store,
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden spell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had the first real grow shops
in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was spare time supply, but they sold
lights in the back of an ocean container
[SPEAKER_01]: to people that knew what they were
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened up a grow store in Willets.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, highway 101 stopped being a
highway and just was like a one lane on
[SPEAKER_01]: each direction road through the town of
Willets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone traveling North would drive
straight through town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this little store on Main
Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was saying was that when I put my
store up, it was right on highway 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally lit up the highway with
the orange glow of high pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the talk of the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody could believe that I was being
so ballsy to like put these lights up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one by one, you know,
the locals from the Hills came down and
[SPEAKER_01]: they heard that they could trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I would deliver soil to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I delivered soil in the most dangerous and
not like dangerous, like gun dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the roads was just psychotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would have known, I never would have
done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get like committed to this
drive and now you can't turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Driving this like U-Haul style box truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little overloaded with soil through like
10 creeks and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I taught a lot of people how to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I taught a lot of people how to grow
better weed than they were already
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought new products to our market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the stuff that I'm really proud
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that I didn't always love
cannabis and always grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for a long part of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how the story went.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was growing before working in and
owning hydro stores, I was paranoid and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't making friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't talking to people about
growing weed, which is what I realized I
[SPEAKER_01]: really liked to do is talk to people about
growing weed, which is one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: why me and not so dog got along so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause that's what, what he wanted to
do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, what happened was one day the
hydro store that I was shopping at it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called hydro depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy asked me if I wanted a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first I was like, no, I don't want
a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I'm doing pretty good doing
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized that if I got this job
and I worked it for a few months,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could make a legitimate income and then
like maybe work towards buying a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of like, you know, renting my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started working at the hydro depot
and that's when I realized that as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a passion for growing, I have a
passion for talking to people about weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and teaching people what I know about
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really felt like my calling was to
do that because not only was I making a
[SPEAKER_01]: good living, I was loving every minute of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when, when clients would come
in, I would love talking to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, you know, I let other
people handle the inventory and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all the, you know, boring stuff
and running a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just talk to people about
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always really honest with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because they knew I wasn't just
trying to sell them some shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: because oftentimes people would come in
and be like, should I buy this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, perfect example was LED lights
before they were ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I opened up my store,
it was 2002.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was already people trying to sell
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember the UFOs, Francis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, they were garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you couldn't successfully grow basil
with those plants, let alone a fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and they sold for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to tell people, if this
technology worked, I would make so much
[SPEAKER_01]: money because everybody would want to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody with high pressure sodium would
immediately want to buy these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't with good conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though people coming in like
wanting the lights and I'd have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, no, it's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very minor flex that I feel
throughout the years, I made a good
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation for myself with growers because
I was honest and I was a place where they
[SPEAKER_01]: could come for information and they felt
safe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people felt safe at my store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so when we're talking about
flexing, it's like, I think I can flex
[SPEAKER_01]: about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of, proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that that's, you know, it's going
to be a part of my legacy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm gone, the chem dog thing is just
like, you know, I'm blushing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like kind of like, it makes me
smile that I'm getting this attention
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, but like Greg, he's the one that
popped the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that he distributed to,
like, what do they get the credit for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where do you draw the line of giving
people props?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it you, Francis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Jason and Ben or like people 10,
10 rows past them that got it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe did better shit with it than
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I mean, I look at it a
little different, you know, I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the chem dog for a second
and then I'll move on to the store because
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think there's some parts about
the store that people would not really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize today, but I'll start with the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I think that, you know,
for whatever reason, even though it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, even though people might play a
small role in something, that role could
[SPEAKER_00]: be super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it turns out somehow that the cutting
that you brought West seems to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that survived and it got, and I'm not sure
if it would be around if you hadn't come
[SPEAKER_00]: out to California with it and then
eventually shared it with a few close
[SPEAKER_00]: friends like Skunk VA or IC collective or
myself or whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like that might be
small, but it's also important because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a critical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they wanted it back on the East
coast, they had to get it from the West
[SPEAKER_00]: coast because that's where, and in
prohibition, right, where people get
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and people move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things change a lot of cool things got
lost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of feel like my only part of
the chem dog story is really like hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: the stories early, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe helping to preserve it at a time
before it was famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, and so perhaps like on the,
on the, the store thing, people might not
[SPEAKER_00]: realize this, but one of the things that
Gabby was talking about, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: critical back then, was that information
on how to grow good weed was really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that knew how to do it
wouldn't talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stores were also super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Gabby is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he opened up his store, he was the
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make me blush, Francis,
you can repeat yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I do feel like, as Gabby mentioned,
when he opened up the store in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County, there was like spare time supply,
which was a big player, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly a garden store and an
outdoor store and an amendment store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no indoor or greenhouse focused
store going on at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stores back then were actually rare,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there wasn't very many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having someone in a store that was
knowledgeable and willing to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a risque thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though proposition two 15 had
happened, it was still very much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's, he, I think you sort of
opened up your shop at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the two 15 medical green rush
here, where there was all these people
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to our County and coming to
Humboldt and these different areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: were new, they had no idea what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, I want to set up a
garage in a greenhouse and I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a long time, it was like,
eventually stores became like who had the
[SPEAKER_00]: best price and people were more
knowledgeable, but probably for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six years that Gabby had a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I mean, he sold stuff,
but it was also like, it was tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: education on what stuff those people
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the store in the early years
was basically like a massive educational
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as Gabby and then, you know,
educated people, they bought things from
[SPEAKER_00]: him because they literally hadn't,
they didn't know how to wire stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about like, you know,
lighting boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about fan movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like they didn't have money
and they're like, what's the best set of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for my set of circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this whole County that was
starting to really blow up and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the funny thing about it is all the
stores that opened up, they were all my
[SPEAKER_01]: customers first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I literally, I literally taught them
everything that they knew about the
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize it today,
but like information was the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: was super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People literally, they had money,
but they had no idea what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's weird about it too,
is that you start, like if you spent time
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you learned a bunch because people
would come to you not only to get set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they would come to you with like every
problem imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would have to, and Gabby would
have to sit down with them and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the more you help people solve
it, the bigger your like information or
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise or knowledge base grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone else brings up that same
problem, like you have, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think people today with all
the, all the forums and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information and all the internet and
everything, can really understand how hard
[SPEAKER_00]: it was to talk to people that knew how to
grow weed, even on the basic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and so probably the first five or
six years, his store was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a boom time where everyone in Mendo
and Humboldt and all these places were
[SPEAKER_00]: just constantly setting up new stuff,
whether they were indoor, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: were greenhouses, whether they were light
deprivation, it was just an enormous boom
[SPEAKER_00]: of economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe 10% of the people knew what they
were doing and would come in and like
[SPEAKER_00]: would have a good idea of what they wanted
and battle on price and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often they would come in completely
oblivious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to mention that I
don't think in today, in 2023,
[SPEAKER_00]: people understand like how ballsy having a
hydro store was and being willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: openly talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With people, you know, I mean,
that was the era where like you walk into
[SPEAKER_00]: a head shop and you say the word bong and
they toss you out in case you were
[SPEAKER_00]: undercover and they were going to shut
down your own shop for real, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was, you know,
there was a, so it was pretty risque.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like pretty out on the,
on the, on the cutting edge of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, to do that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an enormous amount of
people that got their start buying
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and buying soil and buying all
kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing I could mention is like
when you opened your shop, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were still all growing in like,
in, you know, in like a light warrior or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or per light peat moss mixes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby was one of the first people to
really like preach about cocoa fiber and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it was going to revolutionize like
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people had no idea what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at all, you know, and it was brand
new.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I remember is that, you know,
cocoa fiber, if I, if I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, the reason why it became
popular was in Europe, they decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted more environmentally friendly
medium to grow in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rockwell wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were looking around for
something that was biodegradable and a
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized that there was these
giant piles of cocoa fiber and Sri Lanka
[SPEAKER_00]: and India and other places that were just
waste products that they shredded off the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa to get to the coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they realized that if they started
buffering it and treating it the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way, that, you know, um, it could be an
excellent grow media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gabby got some, and there was
stuff that was from like because in Kana
[SPEAKER_00]: that was RHP certified, which basically
meant it was regulated and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed to be a certain level of
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Gabby being like,
Oh my God, dude, like we pull pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: he pull plants out of pots and be like,
look at these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally, like, look at how white
and happy you look at, look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that point on, he was kind of
like a little bit of a prophet about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one had ever really heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his store had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think we, he got lucky in that
he was getting it from reputable sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and there, there was other people that
were getting it cheaper, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it full of like sea salt and it
was unbuffered and people were having
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmares in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I mean, his store was open right
at the time that like cocoa fiber first
[SPEAKER_00]: started percolating around and no one had
even heard of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, people back then they
didn't even know, you know, it was even
[SPEAKER_00]: simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why, why six hundreds were better
than thousands because they were cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: and they gave you more points of life.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, there was a lot of stuff
that people consider basic now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was like essentially in my opinion,
like hidden knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just talk all day long to people
and they would write out all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: lists of stuff they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would hand the list to like an
employee and they would start filling it
[SPEAKER_00]: and he would turn around and he would talk
to the next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just talked about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis was way better than I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was like, he had, he had
patients, you know, and I'm just like
[SPEAKER_01]: always like, I'm trying to help people as
quickly as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I mean, I wondered, I wasn't like,
I was rushing him out the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make a comfortable
environment, but I was just always busy
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing like, like I tried myself and so
my hydro store was based on largely a
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Dutch model was I went to Holland
and I went to the growth stores and they
[SPEAKER_01]: all had espresso makers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I was working for Slavic,
she would always say to me, Gabby,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to buy and get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I try to tell him is that the
longer they stayed, I got opportunities to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell them more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he would see, he would see it as
I'm just talking to these guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for 45 minutes about growing,
you know, and that, you know, he'd rather
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe sweeping the floor or something
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, what I was doing was
building a repertoire with the customers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that they would trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would shop exclusively at
our store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they would trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I opened up my own stores,
the garden spout, you know, I put a coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: bar in and I had chairs there for the
customers to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty unheard of for a
growth store was to make a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wanted it to be a cool place where
people want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and of course some people abused
the privileging and we got annoying and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd have to ask him to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, like it wasn't only
me talking to people, other people would
[SPEAKER_01]: like hear what people were saying and then
they would like interject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became like almost a gathering
point, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as how I got involved with the
Coco, it's because that's what the Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met people while I was in Holland at
the Hortie fair, which is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional ag show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then when I opened up my store,
they had heard about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came and visited me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so the first one we would
buy because Coco and then can a Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I started trying to
source some myself from some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, like those are the things
that I want to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to me, that that's like a much
bigger you know, that's that's my minor
[SPEAKER_01]: flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's the one thing I
want to say about the chem dog flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of an asshole would I look like
if I did flex about my part with the chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I'd be like I'd be looked
at like an asshole, like like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying other people think others are
assholes for doing that flex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the only one who's got the real
flex is Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and like anyone else past that,
it's just kind of like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like Francis said,
people did good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jason made beautiful crosses with
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, people did great stuff with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's their flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they did with the chem dog,
not their like part of the chem dog story,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they acquired it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and having said that,
like, I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy for Jason and Ben that,
like, this could help them in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, it's just not like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes back to a different era
where the way you got cuts, generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, back then was like you honestly
became good friends with someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you shared things and then you
did things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people would call it a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, it was more just
like, you know, friends doing cool little
[SPEAKER_00]: side projects together, you know,
like friends sharing cuts so we could help
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them alive because there was fires
and accidents and busts and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that could happen where you could
lose something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much more informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, you know, you know,
sometimes people would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how do you get cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like become friends with someone that
has cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the reason why you became
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have an honest relationship
with someone and then that leads to other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's almost like organic in
the way that it like it developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't know, that's just
kind of how I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I think it's very one thing
that it's not necessarily a flex,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it's very, very special to be
someone who inspires someone else who does
[SPEAKER_02]: something quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes a culture, whether it's sour,
whether it's cam, whether it's getting to
[SPEAKER_02]: the West Coast, but helping inspiring
other whether you're teaching growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of that to be able to like know on
your deathbed that you've left something
[SPEAKER_02]: behind that has inspired someone else and
made their life better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's that, you know, I mean,
like that should be good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ultimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I said, like, if you called
up and said, hey, Gabby, I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: with not so dog and we want to talk to you
about the garden spout and how you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, accomplish so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'd be like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could actually like, you know,
you know, but like this idea that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: such an integral part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had a little part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought it out to the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to minimize it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, because I know if I didn't bring it
out and it's not out here and maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish the breeding projects that we did
produced more of like what I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like more of a chem dog,
you know, terpene profile because we we
[SPEAKER_01]: did some great shit, but it just didn't
turn out that dog like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I would have done that,
then I could have been proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could have felt like I had more
of part of the chem dog history because I
[SPEAKER_01]: took it to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that is a reason for Jason and
Ben to flex because that is what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking plant that pretty much it
would be a mistake for most people to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like unless you're looking to
use it for breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like growing this for the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and having said that,
I want to grow it for flower again,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like I have knowledge and
tools available to me now that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I could get it to show me
something, you know, better than back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the one thing I was mentioning
in the discord is leaf tissue sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't even thought of doing that with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've already done this at facilities
that I worked with, worked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know who to give credit to,
but somebody mentioned to me that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've been looking in books at
this is what this deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This what this deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, what that means is this is
what a plant looks like when it has zero
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen or like it's not deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just absent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and also or extreme deficiency.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also those photos never show you
what does deficiency look like when it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like because what it's going to
look like is going to look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, for years, the standard
thing was, oh, I had more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what kind of whatever it was,
just add more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it always makes it green plants like
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I did my testing, the testing
showed that I needed more calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least we're not just guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the testing is really
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like seventy five to one hundred
dollars per sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very inexpensive and it gives
you a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the chem dog being a plant that
wants to consume itself prior to harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, two weeks before you're
supposed to cut it, you'd have not a
[SPEAKER_01]: single green leaf left on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so hard to keep this plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With with the leaf analysis, we can learn
how to feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can feed it a little bit better and
maybe keep it greener a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually, you know, actually get a
product that is more like what we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the one other thing I might
mention, if we're going to like flex for
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby here or whatever, is not what time
this is, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but but I know we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to I used to go into a
bunch of different hydro stores for
[SPEAKER_00]: various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Gabby was the first person
that I knew that was really pumping tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, not like the Maristem stuff,
but like the profit, like the cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: and the propagation and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this guy, Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had these and he had these kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he Gabby used to have Bill come.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to come into the store and Gabby
would have him do demos of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize like a tub, how to get clean,
how to like take clean cuts and like
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach and sterilize the cuts and then get
them into solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, like as a as a grower,
it looked like some voodoo in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like at the time, nobody was
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was even thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody was nobody was applying that
to cannabis by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he had a whole shelf on his
store and he would invite Bill in and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would and they would do demos in the shop
and he would get people to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that was literally in the
early 2000s long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's become like a big the only reason
that made me think of it is as you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, Gabby, about leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I kind of feel like because weed was
so illegal for a while, we were reduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: observational stuff and we didn't really
have access to labs and we didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to some of the scientific
stuff that regular ag did because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: too scared and the labs didn't want to
deal with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to like work off what we saw and
talking amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's right in the sense that you
can go get tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get hard data that backs up
your thoughts.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, tissue culture was like
some voodoo, you know, taking these tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little plantlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed very extreme at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why would you go through all that
trouble and you just club?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now knowing more about diseases,
you know, hops late and viral and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish everyone would have been using that
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, Bill, Bill was
going to come in and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby would tell a bunch of good customers
and friends and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's going to come in and he's going
to give a demo and he's going to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use this stuff because it was like,
especially to a bunch of growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like some straight voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me say something real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say something real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sold a bunch of those kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly believe almost no one took
it out of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it because it was still it was
still too like intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the kit didn't cost shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 135 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was really inexpensive,
but they had to go buy a pressure cooker
[SPEAKER_01]: and make the gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, I was able to sell a
lot, but like most people were still a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit intimidated to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember I was intimidated too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had bought the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day Bill Graham comes to the
store and we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every single day I was doing
tissue culture in my store, in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that was just walking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, even though they didn't do
it, they were still like inspired and it
[SPEAKER_01]: made them excited about something,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, a few people actually did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought I was going to
revolutionize things by like people
[SPEAKER_01]: adopting this and doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like the seed thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just weren't ready yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this thing is interesting in that,
you know, I talk about this on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often where it was like,
you know, Gabby and I and some other close
[SPEAKER_00]: like we honestly were just trying to make
better wheat and all the seeds we made,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the projects that we did, everything
like that, especially because of what like
[SPEAKER_00]: flour prices were back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a terrible financial decision
because we could have just been blowing up
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms of flour and getting top dollar for
it way back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was literally like a labor
of love, you know, and it was it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily about like, oh, what do we
think people will like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, what do we like personally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we make stuff that we like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Gabby, I was thinking about
it because Matt and I have been blessed in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to talk to some of like Neville's
good friends that were close to him in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last years of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because one of the things
Neville said is like, I wish I didn't fail
[SPEAKER_00]: so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the best stuff that I got,
I improved on it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew that I wish I would have
known then what I know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a different shot at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that thing that you
expressed is very common in breeding where
[SPEAKER_00]: people that breed are very self-critical
and they tend to discount what they did
[SPEAKER_00]: when they did it because they wanted it to
be better and they had their own goals in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they reach failure,
I mean, there's a lot of it has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take it serious, there has to be a
lot of failure because you just be
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting, you know, numbers all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I don't think it's failure
in the sense of you produce something
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a failure in the sense of you have an
expectation of what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce and you have a lot less control of
it than, you know, because that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, either that or it's really
expert breeding or really anal people like
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think like so when we did the F1
cross, you know, with back to the chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog, right, and then we grew out so many
thousands of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have thought that some would
have like really been dog like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they just weren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you would think like,
you know, when you do that first cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the most diversity and now you
just got to do the hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the skunk was so dominant.
That.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was traces of it, you know,
like, you know, like it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, of course, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other thing, the other thing
I think we should mention, because like
[SPEAKER_00]: the game is flipped now, but is that when
Gabby and I were doing all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the feminized reversals and stuff like
that were still years away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of thought that like at times that
like hermaphrodism and like accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations were going to lead you down
the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff that we did was with regular
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had to create hybrids and then
and back cross and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had to grow out the
seeds to see if what we did did what we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no idea that we could take two
females and reverse one of them and add
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we knew we could do it, but would
never consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were already selling seeds by that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that hermaphrodism and seeds
from hermaphrodism were risked
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditism because you were going to
infect your line with more traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: were bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that was just kind of
like, I don't know, in the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that was just the common thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still uncertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still uncertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to Matthew about this the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to me, like.
It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know it's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's oh, and I know it's commonly
done, but I still feel like doing this has
[SPEAKER_01]: to pose some type of risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, it's common for people to feel
like you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you think we're wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think I think you're totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to an extent, it is proven by
genetics, like by genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe it's just hard for males to
accept it like we might become irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's actually normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would accept that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would accept that more than the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis plant male is the most
unappreciated plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've gone to a point where regular
seeds are, you know, unicorns almost in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost everything is feminized
reversals of some fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Gabby and I were doing it,
like, you know, the only feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew of were, you know, accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, yes, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard of reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reversals we had ever heard of
then was like you stressed the hell out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hermaphrodite itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in a small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You messed with the light sky cycle until
it freaked out and did some weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no sprays we ever thought about
trying to like induce anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like you basically like tortured
the plant until it did what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the tech that we knew of
back then, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seemed like the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I said, it's very common for
people from your era to still have that
[SPEAKER_02]: that mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody we've talked to on here from
your exact era all have that same opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: still to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, and I mean,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always say that you're old when you
think you know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad that, like, I'm not
confident about this and that every day my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion might be going more towards
towards yours, Matt, like in our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like selfing could be more
problematic or it seems like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could have more potential for problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so one thing like we're talking about
Colin from Ethos, like he said something
[SPEAKER_01]: and it seems so obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how could I go my whole life
and not think of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you cross two females,
you have a so much better idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like trying to judge, trying to judge
what males all was the right one to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, you know, you have to be you
have to be very, very adept or very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do things over and over again,
you know, and then do a lot of testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is almost impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like how does one grow out thousands
of seeds and preserve every single clone
[SPEAKER_01]: of every one trying to smoke every female?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we would do Gabby and I would do
this thing where we settled kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing the super dog stuff is like,
I think we picked out like our seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight favorite males based on like looks
and certain traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put them all in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so usually like the ones with the cute
butt cheeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them all in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they get to a certain
point, like you beat them with a with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a bamboo stake or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the fans are on and you just like
the pollen would just spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, well, it's going to make
the hunt harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we don't know which male is
doing the right thing was the one we
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to just find the one and we wanted
maximum diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how that's how you're going to
get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to be so arrogant that like you can
pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't us, you know, so like having
having three or four males in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big deal of finding that needle
needle in the haystack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we presented it when we gave them to
see they're all going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the two phenomenal plants cross
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like they're all going to be
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you've got to grow a bunch
of them and you're going to find,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a few that are super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember, Gabby?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one of the final one of the final
readings we did, I was trying to I was
[SPEAKER_00]: racking my brain for their names and their
names really aren't important,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had these buddies of yours and
they gave us a version of the Black Domina
[SPEAKER_00]: and they gave us that warlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things, because we did this
when we did the like the one of the final
[SPEAKER_00]: Superdog readings, we basically put these
like, I don't know, seven or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: different males that we had picked in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of the Superdog females that we
liked and then literally like every good
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that we could get access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the dog and we had the super
skunk and we had the and we had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Mendo P and we had the
warlock and the Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had I mean, like literally every
good female cut that him or I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of gathered them all up and we put
them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you found the one, you didn't care
what made the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just needed to find the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we were knowing what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing what it was would have been
helpful to to try to do more things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, for instance, I don't remember
who gave me the Black Domina, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the reason why we bought it was
and I think that was from Sensi Seed or we
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased seed from some seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The description said extremely spider mite
resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the weed was garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we could make our weed more like,
you know, we could cross it with a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not so dog and get a plant that
was good quality and spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's why that that's why
that one was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other one that you mentioned,
Francis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the warlock?
[SPEAKER_00]: They both came from the same people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember who gave me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were they were your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, neither was that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you're comparing to chem dog,
I imagine not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the funny thing is like there's
things where I felt exactly how Gabby
[SPEAKER_00]: felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later, I was like,
man, I was just like discounting too many
[SPEAKER_00]: things because they weren't like my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean they weren't valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that like they weren't in my
top couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and as I got older, I
appreciated different qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed, you know, where in the beginning
it was kind of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you wanted that weed that tasted
amazing and like hit you across the head
[SPEAKER_00]: with a two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wanted to cover sour a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked a little bit about how you met
Klopp, but what were some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: impressions of sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I didn't have many till much
later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and we used to grow a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't remember exactly when it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the deal with it was it was
a highly productive strain of beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that we could sell easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was I was on the discord
and somebody had to remind me or tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: that most of the people in the discord are
really small growers, like they grow in a
[SPEAKER_01]: tent and it's for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a big difference
between that and even somebody that grows
[SPEAKER_01]: in his garage, you know, has a 10 lighter
in his garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you do need to make some money to pay
for your expenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole reason why you put up 10
lights in your garage was to make a little
[SPEAKER_01]: money in the first place.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to you have to do what's
marketable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the reason why we gave
up on the chem dog in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, when you're getting such a
terrible yield, you know, off of this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, like we couldn't justify like we'd
have to sell it for 50 to 100 percent more
[SPEAKER_01]: than we would to sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we weren't getting that much
more for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like we would keep it and
we'd grow a little bit for our head stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Francis said, you know,
somebody was growing it and we would all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, share a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit would never get sold because
we're growing such a small amount of it
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, it didn't make it to the
to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to I want to publicly say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I say that louder?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a living working in
cannabis and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a total different thing than
when you're just trying to grow for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, whether it's in your backyard or
in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is if I was growing just for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just grow, oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what I like to smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether it's the chem dog or,
you know, other really nice oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: geez, that's really the palette that I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and actually, I should say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have a diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then is that always the staple that I
go to every morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I'll mix in some other stuff like
I love sativa turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love citrus turps, you know,
you know, I love to have a variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I was telling you guys, I smoke
these soft parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have like 30 different types of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are so aggressive that it's
shocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still awesome, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but still, I still always lean towards
the OGs is what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, right now, in California,
in the commercial marketplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to sell a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the first in the.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been going on for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, you know,
like in the discord, people are hating on
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fuck, that's what that's what big
farms want to buy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like they're missing the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so let me tell you a mistake that I
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a new nursery, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have all these genetics that are
super awesome, but nobody knows anything
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you try to sell people on this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with today's market, they need to know
that they're getting a home run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's so hard to get them to try
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when right now they can sell all
the lemon cherry gelato they can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so like when when I started this,
I didn't have a lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, by the time I get this thing
in mass production, it's going to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: the ice cream cake or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, like nobody's going to want
this weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like it's managed to have lasting
power as far as the demand for the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing a ten lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really better off, you know,
growing something that people want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then maybe a small section
of it for your own personal, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: Francis and I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we always do a little bit of
a chem dog, but like we had to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that was more productive and that
people wanted to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the funny thing about the super
skunk is the most beautiful weed like the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog was the best super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that weed is the most
beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way it looks, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was green and frosty and smelled
like crazy and it was super pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a kind of aroma that like is very
universally recognized by Americans as
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I also think, too,
that like to the point that Gabby was
[SPEAKER_00]: making, it's weird in that if certain
strains don't leak and they don't get out
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain amount of people,
then the demand for them can't grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then makes selling it much harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we would try to sell the chem dog
and they would be like, ah, this is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like some like bag seed or something
like how good could it be if I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since there was only like a few
garages or something like that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or two that was trying to grow
some, it was like brokers want to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them, that wasn't a home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before the forum fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before it got like a really big
name for itself in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people just wanted things that was
going to be something easy for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was just going to say that a
lot, especially in Mendo, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt and stuff like that,
a lot of times what broker, what growers
[SPEAKER_00]: grew, what was what they heard the brokers
wanted and was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a few years there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, if we wanted to go
back and talk about like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby's store, like every big indoor
grower in Mendocino County was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of purple Urkel or granddaddy
perps or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember how many Laytonville indoor
gardeners, Gabby, were growing an Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granddaddy perps, you know, all those
types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then the market shifted and it
went to sour and Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those growers dropped the purples
and went right into what the brokers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a, you know, there's a lot
there where it's like you might end up
[SPEAKER_00]: liking a strain, but you end up growing a
small amount of it for you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you end up growing what
the, you know, the majority of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is what you think the brokers or the
market wants to absorb relatively easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my new strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have 30% of exclusive stuff
that, you know, I'm bringing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, you know, one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have 30% of, you know,
up and coming from known people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 30%, but that only ends up to
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 33% of each, 33% of stuff that people
want right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that way I can, I can sell
people what they want now while creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for products under my brand,
as well as partnerships with existing
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, you know, but thinking I could do
it all with like exclusive stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody knows anything about, even though
like it's fire weed that won the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that, that takes a little
bit more today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of legal, a lot of legal farms,
they're sort of drowning under upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: fees and costs and taxes and operating
expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they real, their margins are a lot of
times quite tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really want home runs because
they're worried about survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not for elite, especially
for, you know, for most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a particularly lucrative time in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of more of like a stay afloat
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the, the more it's like that,
the more people want certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that leads to sameness because
people want, it hurts the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts quality and it hurts diversity
because people are just trying to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: an already popular thing at a low cost and
get somebody to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's risky, like he was just saying to
try to promote fire that you personally
[SPEAKER_00]: think is amazing, but the market might not
think that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have the capacity to like
convince them or are you just going to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than when your market was,
you were showing your friends your weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking some with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, then it was easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like selling it in bulk to
whether it's a distributor or a broker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody, it's too far from the
final person for people to be taking these
[SPEAKER_01]: risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're just pumping the gelatos,
you know, and realistically, like today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in California, most commercial
farms, they have some type of gelato in
[SPEAKER_01]: their rotation, you know, because the
market is calling for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the consumer, the consumer,
I don't want to call them idiots,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're uneducated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also to be fair to them,
Gabby, it's also hard to make new
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions when you walk into a legal store
and everything that you want to check out
[SPEAKER_00]: is in a sealed, opaque mylar that they
can't touch it, smell it, smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or get excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to like spend a bunch of
money on it and then hopefully when they
[SPEAKER_00]: open it up, it's something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the way these mylars are
designed, you don't even see the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: inside it until you've walked out of the
store and purchased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look at what percentage THC it
is, whatever has the most, they take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they've been told.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even if a farmer, even if a
farmer wants to take risks, it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: on the farmer, the distro and the
dispensary also has to be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote that to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer oftentimes doesn't even have
control over whether or not the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to get educated properly on why
they think it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really, really try our best to
reach out to bud tenders with this show as
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy as it sounds, like they're the last
point before the customers and we want
[SPEAKER_02]: them to be at least be the most educated
out of the whole ring because they're the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones who interact the most with the
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I was remembering,
Gabby, and I don't know, this is a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: random story, but Gabby and I did a
project together where we built this
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse on a property he had and we
thought it was a huge greenhouse at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but now it's like laughably small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you remember when we grew the Maui
dude and those buds were so big,
[SPEAKER_00]: we took those pictures where your head was
behind the cola and all you could see was
[SPEAKER_00]: your ponytail and your ears sticking out
because there was these giant colas coming
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic high time submission photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you know we'd see in high
times is a bud in front of their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had these giant, we grew, we had Urkel
and Maui and Superdog and various things
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, those things probably burned in
your fire, but at some point we had all
[SPEAKER_00]: these pictures and that's hard too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was thinking about it and it's
like before phones had cameras on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was so many less pictures taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby had some nice cameras and so we took
some really cool photos of various things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were doing, but all it took was a
fire or a bust or an accident or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and all that history would be
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always remember that of Gabby's head
behind these Maui buds and all you could
[SPEAKER_00]: see was he used to have this really long
ponytail and all you could see was a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ponytail and maybe the corner of
one ear because the bud was like three
[SPEAKER_01]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean it was pretty risque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we started on it, the greenhouse
was going to be 20 by 50 and Gabby thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that was enormous so we shrank it to 20 by
30 and it still seemed like it was ballsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the top of the hill in an open
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later that kind of stuff was a
little bit more the norm, but at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it was coming out of the tree lines and it
was coming out of the indoors and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of these tiny little scenes and
it seemed giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed giant in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the idea that you could put something
like you just said in an open field and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always blew my mind about up there in
the Emerald Triangle that anybody could do
[SPEAKER_02]: that because you cannot do that here
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always a game of cat and mouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our thinking on it was, so there was a
generally well-known or maybe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, but we always thought as long as
you have under 100 plants then it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: the feds aren't going to want to deal with
this and the local cops, they're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with much bigger people.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the greenhouse they could never
actually, and actually you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: medically have 25 plants at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the greenhouse it was like you can't
really see what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't see what's in there then we
felt a little sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was just we were kidding
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though you could smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you can't smell it from a
helicopter and if you could you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you're smelling because everyone
was growing up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was a remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea was just like keep it kind
of small and make it not worth the trouble
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the issue that we never thought of is
we had a perfect landing pad over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have like landed 10 helicopters
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like a shady, like a sketchy
mountainside terrain like they have no
[SPEAKER_01]: place to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like a flat motor fucking landing
pad over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted to fuck with us it would
have been bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'll bring this up just because I
just thought of it, but like when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the skunk, you know like that spot
we were just talking about was remote
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really didn't have neighbors that you
were too worried about, but when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the skunk inside it was kind of
before the carbon filter era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like where you had like you
know the UOV Nair, like the ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: generators and stuff and you'd grow that
skunk and like two weeks before it was
[SPEAKER_00]: done you'd pull up into your driveway with
your windows down and you'd be like oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: god it smells for 50 yards in every
direction around my house like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: slaughtering skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm gonna get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god it reeks and we used to do all
these things like talking and like venting
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to do all this different stuff
and it just beat every effort we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to contain the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was uncontainable and so and some
people would get rid of it because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: too fragrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like caused panic, you know.
Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, correct, Francis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reeks so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He don't know any more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows that it might have been super
skunk or skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the thing about it is for me is
that I always thought, Gabby, that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that you know you get when I when
I when you gave me clones it was like you
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me the dog and you gave me and you
gave me skunk and just by your stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking about this too okay and
you know and I know how important this is
[SPEAKER_01]: to so many people so I don't want to get
it wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I explicitly remember getting the
skunk from the dude in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that plant isn't the one that
looks just like the the sensi seed catalog
[SPEAKER_01]: and we had gotten we had gotten the seeds
from sensi and that's how we got our
[SPEAKER_01]: original crop that we were meant that you
know that we got the males from to to make
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like super dog and nesto?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that so that so that's the way I
remember it but as such an important part
[SPEAKER_01]: of history, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not signing any David's or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's all that's all anyone wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you don't quite have an answer and
it's best guess, that's the best guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's it more advanced than we
were before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I I mean you believe that I will
I will repeat the same story the next time
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said that somebody was telling
the story and every time they told it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'm gonna tell it
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm I'm also not swearing to
accuracy, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is it's a it's a it's a long
ass time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really it's it's literally decades ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ask yourself the question, Francis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't we get the seeds in order to make
the first cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing is that when we were
talking earlier, you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we just use the males.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had that from the sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had that one female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you that like that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that one female came
to be because by the time that I came into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like you gave me the you gave me skunk
and dog the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't you don't have it anymore,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it when I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whenever that was,
anyone give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because because because one of them one of
them is probably in sour and one of them
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably in chem dog D and diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if we don't have it,
then like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have the we have the last two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would like to know kind of which
one went where because people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe us on that on that little part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what part is not believed that like the
chem dog D it would would have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk chem 91 connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, they still think it's sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't they don't they don't
believe us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we disagree with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably neither of us will ever be proven
right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just enjoy this debate for the
rest of our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, like I don't have a
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the source material beyond
people's words.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we need to have all the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had all the genetics and futuristic
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we already don't have all the possible
genetics because it's lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can I can identify it from a photo of a
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody was growing it like the weed
is so unique and it looks just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking sensei seed catalog photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's the only weed that I've ever
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you could do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll send you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that think it's I mean,
this causes all kinds of debate because
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens now, Gabby, is that people
people get get excited about old school
[SPEAKER_00]: famous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's opportunists that are
like, I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to sell you clones for a
high dollar or I'm going to make a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of hybrids with seed and you'll be able to
get it in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a bunch of fakes that
proliferate about various stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these there's all this
politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buyer must the buyer must be where
they must be where.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like and that's and that's why you buy
seeds from a reliable source like Riot
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if not, you know, like,
you know, the buyer must be where and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're only paying,
you know, even one hundred dollars a pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: one hundred fifty dollars a pack,
you know, you can roll the dice when you
[SPEAKER_01]: got situations like companies that should
be remain unnamed that are selling packs
[SPEAKER_01]: for a thousand bucks or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you really want to know you're
getting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think genetics are worth that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're actually getting what you're
promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: If if someone is saying this is what
you're getting, this is what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what, you know, I think,
you know, genetics can be worth thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're dealing with unreputable
people and the thing about unreputable
[SPEAKER_01]: people is they get called out pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the other person we were
talking about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, what happened, you know,
what happens is, Gabby, is is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, because we don't have genetic
testing and because we don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed what we have is we have
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stories get, you know,
like there's people that are like they buy
[SPEAKER_00]: into the story and then there's people
that are like, that guy's a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy his story at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Francis, you know, we answer if we
answer these questions, life would be
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely boring and some people would
have no lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like like what are
these people going to do when they stop
[SPEAKER_01]: arguing or or the skunk is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's many things where like
when I would tell when I would tell those
[SPEAKER_00]: stories on previous podcasts, there would
be people that would get all mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: At me and would be like, you don't know
the dude that brought him West.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were never really friends with that
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know what to tell you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you call me, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I got his fucking phone
number right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I was honestly like even
with that, I could help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather say it again for people
that are just stepping in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Francis said was pretty pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anything that was inaccurate or not
completely accurate was maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: timelines and minor details that really
don't change the story much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the basis of the story is
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I think you did a better
job than I would have been able to just
[SPEAKER_01]: because.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've been thinking about it
for longer and, you know, you've you've
[SPEAKER_01]: spelled it out in your mind and possibly
on paper what you've thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obsesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those stories just come from like a
million times of like me and Gabby sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on a couch somewhere, stoned, shooting the
shit about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just friendship sharing stories
about this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's honestly like why I
believed Gabby so much more than some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the later stuff that came up was because
he didn't have a reason to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was way before the fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was years and years before Skunk the A
got on the forums and anybody knew Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The public hadn't heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just stories amongst friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was able to it was always the same
story, no matter how bad or right you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was friends sharing stuff, you know,
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and Gabby and I had a very
similar view.
[SPEAKER_00]: On weed in the sense that like we both
liked really good weed and we both wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to make better weed if we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I almost did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost didn't say it, dude, but like way
back in the day, I liked sativas and like
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby hated them because he was like,
dude, I'm so high strung.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want weed to like calm me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, maybe you're so calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get like a little anxious or a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't want to do that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to mellow out like you're mellow
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to smoke sativa and get all
zippy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need to be brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be I need to be mellowed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were telling me to chill out,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were like, Gabby, chill the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I'm going to have to I'm
going to have to stop this in a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that I'll say this is that California
is a bunch of you know, there's it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Gabby coming from, you know,
being a New York Jew coming west,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought it was aggressive,
but it was like where he came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody talked like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was normal as normal could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just like, you know,
it wasn't anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, there's cultural
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move from the East Coast or New York
to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not culturally the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved from Chicago to, you know,
to to Mendo, I was like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I'll end it on this
because Gabby's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like my best friend growing up that
became really good friends with Gabby,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he used to do this thing
where he'd call it California nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd be like, if you want to tell me,
fuck you, just tell me, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be nice to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell me, you know, I have no
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, piss off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me add one thing to that before you go
before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I first got to California,
it totally freaked me out when like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cashier would start making conversation
with the person in line in front of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm next in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm next in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this lady's like, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, hope you have a great
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like thinking, just fucking
