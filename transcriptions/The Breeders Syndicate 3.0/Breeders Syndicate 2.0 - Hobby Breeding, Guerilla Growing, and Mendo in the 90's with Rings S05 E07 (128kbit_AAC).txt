[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's see if we can get this shit
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rains, what's up, Rains?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can get Frank on here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what a pain in the ass that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my Riot Seeds account's been
reported a bunch and isn't working anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we need to get... Or maybe he's trying
to go live on his, trying to figure this
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second, I might have to pause it just
to text you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, Rains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, not so there you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you not get the invite, not so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just smooth as silk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, can no one else hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anybody hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only one person's responding about that,
so hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not so cannot join.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so go do a live and we'll try to join
that one then, because there's some fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: up shit going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so, anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find... I don't get what's going
on with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Request to join, not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, there he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a fucking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: My other account wasn't letting everybody
join, for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was smooth as silk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, everybody can hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like people can hear,
so that's positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, people pop on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, Matt,
without kids, how many different pastel
[SPEAKER_01]: colors of headphones do you own?
[SPEAKER_02]: I own a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a few pretty pairs of headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every week you're busting out new.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these are old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worn these another week.
[SPEAKER_02]: New to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have these for... Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, people are joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like normally that was eight
minutes of fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that most people are going to
know to come on this account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is something covering your microphone?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nothing's covering the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the microphone's through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is better?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's running a mic through this stupid
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Thousandfold, for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, today, this week's topic, we're going
to talk to our buddy who brings around his
[SPEAKER_02]: own anus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about farming in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are old buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been in Mendo a few years longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a straight nerd like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to hear about his adventures
in old Mendoville.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you want to kick it off, Frank?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can introduce yourself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when Matt and I were
discussing this whole podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of the whole theme or purpose of
it, really, was to sort of like share in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way how we talk amongst each other all the
time.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as we, you know, and bring a little
bit of that to like the discourse or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to talk about world
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, my buddy is one of the people that
I've talked about all kinds of stuff for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in the same small little town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both come from the Midwest,
like Homie said.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually been out here probably four
years longer than me or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, over a quarter century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we've kind of both seen,
you know, like a lot of the different eras
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think people would consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to consider them
legendary or just old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, when we were talking last show
about like a lot of hobbyist breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of multi-stage breeding and learning
about your plants, Rings is someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been, you know, basically when you
first got here in the 90s, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a clone world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a seed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember any popular clones
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I got here, it was all
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd hear about some indoors here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see little batches of indoor here
and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a couple of lights,
you know, little bits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so there's an aspect there
where nowadays people view the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding like that used to be done around
Mendo a lot just to have beans as
[SPEAKER_01]: something sort of mysterious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, Rings basically never left
that era in the sense of he always he has
[SPEAKER_01]: been breeding kind of for what he likes,
plants he likes, things that interest him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, regular breeding, no feminized
reversals or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some accidents now and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just looking at what plants show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really does tie into what we've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also ties into like a whole era
like pre-215, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like after 215 passed,
it probably took what, Rings, like five or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like 2002 people feeling like
they actually could lean on 215,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it passed in whatever year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody said, yeah, nobody thought they
were going to be able to grow in their
[SPEAKER_00]: yard and not get fucked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were still, you know, keeping it
mellow, keeping it on the down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then some friends of mine let it rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just went for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cops came.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tried to rip it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops got called and the cops left the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were, oh, it's a fucking green
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a major green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for the first time, we were
putting them out in the sun and not
[SPEAKER_00]: worried and realizing the potential that a
plant could get real big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chronologically speaking, when you were
in Wisconsin, what you were seeing out
[SPEAKER_02]: there was what type of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like mostly, were you seeing the Afghanis
proliferate out there still pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time you started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a few, some of my older brother's
buddies were growing little gardens in
[SPEAKER_00]: their apartments and whatever,
but I didn't really know any outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growers there, but you'd see the weed once
in a while come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, it seemed like it was pretty
standard kind of Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that climate back there,
you are limited, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us some strain names, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you seeing in Wisconsin strain
wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people would say things like
Ghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basic, not named like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just stoked if you got something
that wasn't compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, there was two kinds of
weed, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was green Mexican and brown Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the level of compression could vary
widely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best stuff was green and lightly
compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, some of the worst stuff was
incredibly compressed and very brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strain names, I mean, you know,
they just, yeah, I think I think maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'm speaking, but barely anyone knew
what I was doing when I lived in Chicago
[SPEAKER_01]: and was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you are in a major populated area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a rural area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, it was all bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember just people hearing
about my friends and I smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like one of my buddies got
busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drinking and driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he was in the cops, they're like,
we know you and that guy are selling weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, it was like,
we were, we were buying like a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce once a month and smoking it in one
hitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so far away, but I mean,
we were like dealers in our hometown
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are asking about various
imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak for rings, but we both come
from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little farther North than I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was rural and I was city,
but I literally saw Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the Grateful Dead came into town,
there would be some kind bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no Jamaican imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no Columbia and there was no
tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no anything named.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Brown and Green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I got tie stick once and it was
literally tied with a string on a stick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was very fortunate where I met the,
I like to say the right dirt bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie biker types that were older and
they weren't going to smoke the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, they had networks set up somehow
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at least getting like pretty decent
green weed pretty much from the start,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was, I mean, there was no weed
scene in my high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all just drinking and there was a
couple of stoners, but there was no scene
[SPEAKER_00]: there at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it just wasn't, you know,
Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You moved from Northern Wisconsin to our
neck of the woods, Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, was it, was it 94?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1994, 1994, right at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what I was even getting
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just knew one person came out
here within 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was standing next to a pot plant
watching naked girls swim in a pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was like walking right into a
wet dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was already very into the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already had all the seed catalogs
memorized because I was buying high times
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff and I had grown a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wired up a 175 metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend rigged one together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few plants and that I had saved
some seeds from some decent weed and we
[SPEAKER_00]: grew some failed attempts at growing some,
some Mexican seeds or whatever outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that just went to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it was very minimal
before I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your, what was your impetus for
coming out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually thought I was going to end up
in like New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had dreams of desert living when
I left there and I knew one guy here and
[SPEAKER_00]: he was one of my hookups for good weed and
mushrooms, acid, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he, he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him and he was like, I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving out to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever there, here's my aunt's
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll know where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a hair up my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I had been all over the
country traveling with my family growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up, but I had never been in California
state line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I just thought I'd swing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, within 20 minutes,
all kinds of just to me, unimaginable
[SPEAKER_00]: things were unfolding in front of my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, weird hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew up in a pretty
conservative in a box type of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of various lifestyle
choices and diversity or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like where I'm raised, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit is entertaining right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, stories of weird hippies in the
mountains and pagan groups and old
[SPEAKER_00]: communes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, fuck, this is,
this is entertaining right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, naked girls are a big bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but I mean, a lot of times
people, people think people think when
[SPEAKER_01]: they hear Mendocino County, because now
it's super famous for growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that it wasn't famous for growing
weed already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that most people's like earliest
memory of like Mendo now is like two is
[SPEAKER_01]: the two is the medical era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you had like a leg to stand on and
you could kind of, it was sort of a cat
[SPEAKER_01]: and mouse between things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we both first moved out there,
it was a totally different world in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of like everybody that did it kept
it pretty quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, there was a number of people
in town that had successful businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that did it, but they kept real
quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done tucked away.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't want people to know their
money came from wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I were talking about the successful
guys were driving beat up old trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have never known they weren't,
there was no flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, we were talking just the other
day about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'd be guys that like were worth a
lot of money and their truck would be old
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little rusted and have a few debts
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like they popped the hood and the
whole thing is chrome and super cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: souped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a souped up, like they've got
great suspension.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all this nice shit,
but it's like, they could drive through
[SPEAKER_01]: our crap little town and look normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody wanted to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted to get targeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even when two 15, even when two
15 passed, um, it took, like he said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it took a number of years for the people
to get a sense of what you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of the people I learned
from and were, was exposed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were older already then and had been
doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, they, they weren't, they didn't
even, they didn't even have, they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even have a fancy engine in their truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were just chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just glad to, to be living up in
the mountains and having a home and be
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and being more comfortable
than a person working at one of the local
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were living good,
eating good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to realize too, that Mendo was pretty
famous for being a huge logging community,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that had sort of fallen apart in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would classify it as pretty poor
when I first arrived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very poor, very poor, very rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like even having money was unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody that had money was from
some established, well-known family that
[SPEAKER_01]: owned businesses in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no, there was hardly even any
weed around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even though it was Mendo and
whatever, it would run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were holding something decent,
you were the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there really wasn't a lot then.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you had two or three patches in
the woods and you got away with one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them and you got 30 pounds, you were like
loaded down with cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a lot of loot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had whatever you needed that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120,000 bucks in 94 would have been,
you know, that's like, that'd be like
[SPEAKER_00]: having 500,000 bucks now practically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the prices were at that time for
land and homes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people, but yet they couldn't show
it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of, you didn't really know
who was holding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not so, and I were talking the
other day and he met some guy that had
[SPEAKER_00]: copious amounts and he was living in a
shack in walking around in his underwear
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's actually like, I was telling
him it's probably like the wealthiest
[SPEAKER_01]: person in weed I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not even exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew exactly who he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the wealthiest person I think I've
ever met in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a bunch of huge scenes that I
don't want to describe, but he had this
[SPEAKER_01]: like visqueen, like black and white poly
shack that like stretched like in between
[SPEAKER_01]: the trees with rope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a really nice like teak wooden
table in this thing and he slept in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked around like he had a huge
like multi pack of tidy whiteys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hot up there and he would walk
around in his tidy whiteys and his boots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he lived in a visqueen shack up on the
rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he literally like, I mean,
he, and he sold like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he made so much money,
you know, but it was just, that was his
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't leave the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, and it was just hot and he didn't like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he walked around and you know,
it almost think you'd almost think that
[SPEAKER_01]: like he escaped from like a mental
institution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't blame the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk around like that in my house and
I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still, I'm carrying the torch too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a way it's like, if you busted
that guy like, he had nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, he might own 15
properties and have like underground grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and generators and this and that and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, you know, it's like,
if they came and tried to get him,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, he didn't have sports cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have a nice big house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have boats.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have anything that they could
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that's, that's kind of like what
I was thinking about when, when you were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about that rings was like the real
old timers around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just liked to live up here and they
liked having enough money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't poor and they didn't
acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd meet a lot of like parkour kids and
they traveled the world and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they weren't flashing anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was like their luxury,
like their parents would help them travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like, that was more like
flashing wealth and Mendo kind of became
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a two 15 era thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you had a leg to stand on with the,
with your, your legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was unthinkable to flash in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would put it, it was
unthinkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know a few people that were
probably dumb enough to flash in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they ran a some kind of Hollywood
mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were bringing actors in and out to
show them their little tiny shithole girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of them went to jail and had
Woody Harrelson bail him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only people I could think of
that were dumb enough to flashlight that
[SPEAKER_02]: like bring people into a mansion with
grows and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy before I even moved here,
I mean, they've had documentaries about
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy and I can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the biggest importers in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was bringing everything in through the
Bay and he built on Robinson Creek road.
[SPEAKER_00]: He built this big mansion with like watch
towers on it and hidden rooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened before I got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like his house was pretty hidden,
but it was pretty extravagant and he went
[SPEAKER_00]: down, he went down big and he's out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually just bought that mansion back
from this guy I knew who owned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was maybe people should know
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first moved out here,
I literally had like just like rings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one friend that lived a little north
of Ukiah and that was like sort of my
[SPEAKER_01]: landing spot where he got me situated in
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was going to be a bunch
of like grateful dead hippies and back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the landers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it was like, I was from the city
and it was all these country people that
[SPEAKER_01]: lived clean and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got here and there was some hippies,
but there was a lot of weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of rednecks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting a person I like like you that just
seemed mellow and like nice and stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a rough crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the hippie side of it was pretty
mellow, but I mean, most of it was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as quantities went,
those were people way out in the boonies
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had guns and they were,
you know, I mean, tales of shooting at
[SPEAKER_00]: helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of rough people out in the
boonies growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There had always been a way where weed
allowed a certain amount of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a lot of fucking mental illness,
anger management and various other ticks
[SPEAKER_01]: to like survive well, but not have to like
smooth those issues out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were suspicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's aspects of that,
you know, in the sense of it was just very
[SPEAKER_01]: eye opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once logging left, this place was
poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only weed, people think it was
a weed mecca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the Mexicans took it over,
like Northern California, it was also like
[SPEAKER_01]: where lots of little batches of meth got
cooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a whole underbelly of meth
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a little bit of a blending
of the two communities, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but you know, there was, there,
there was various motorcycle groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was all kinds of weirdos that own
land in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was not populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a lot of weed was always a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember people way back then
talking about like hiring meth heads
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep, keep them high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll dig 200 holes in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll steal all your shit when
you're not looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe not if you had, I mean,
people did things like tied mountain lions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of their patch and chained
them up to trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was- That checks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the stories, the deep well of
bizarre stories in this part of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's troubling, funny, you know,
very, a lot of disturbing stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, I mean, actually it hasn't
been very violent around here the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, the murders, the partners shooting
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it's really tamed down finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there, there was an
aspect where there's someone even older
[SPEAKER_01]: than us that I hope to be able to bring on
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can speak of like the eighties,
but by the time rings and I got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, camp had been sort of hammering
the County for a good 12, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was a lot of back and
forth between that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of sort of secret society,
like people really kept to eat to
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard to get accepted into
certain groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very, it was a little paranoid at a
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, you know,
let's face it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so you're getting four or $5,000 a
pound for your weed and you have a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of money and it's dark and it's cold
and it's Mendo and you're bored and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was all kinds of scandalous,
you know, substance use, which was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of which had negative
connotations for whole little groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On, on some of the old growers I met when
I moved out here, they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the seventies or whatever late early
eighties, they'd be like, things started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, that's when people started
trading their weed for Coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became trading it for meth,
you know, and it just started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the first guys I worked
with told me basically that exact story
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you get 4,500 or 5,000 a pound
for anything that you grow, that's decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you get bored in the winter and
then the one guy gets a kilo of cocaine or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, and he goes, then the problem
is, is five years later, everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: cheating on everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people are messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are this, people are that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you got in trouble back then,
you either went to jail for two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four years usually, or you had to narc
on your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really wasn't a defense,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an aspect there of like,
you know, I mean, there's, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was, you know, there was,
there was opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was every problem you could imagine
existed on some scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't that many people.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like it, but there was,
there was partiers of all kinds and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was people that were definitely into a
bunch of bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, weed was a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, maybe on a positive note,
before we get too dark on that level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does set the stage because I mean,
I, I'll tell a very quick story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember like, I was hiking with friends
and we were up on this majestic trail and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still pretty like new from,
from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even just Hills excited me,
you know, like big expansive trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh, I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like looking out over this thing
and it's all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked down and there's like dozens
of cars that people, it was like a spot
[SPEAKER_01]: that people drove up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to get rid of their trash,
they would push their car off the ledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would just roll down the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and like the Hills were littered
with this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed when I moved out here,
like every time you found a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: turnoff to stop and look at the scenery,
there'd be like just trash below you every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of the country people would
just take their trash and drive and be
[SPEAKER_01]: going down the road at night and just bags
of trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would just throw out their vehicle
off, off the Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people, so I was shocked because I
thought it was going to come out coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to come to this
clean, pristine place, weed growing
[SPEAKER_01]: hippies, redwoods, the organic food,
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all there in bits and pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was all this other stuff that I
had never seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it makes sense because,
you know, that, that stuff really started
[SPEAKER_01]: stopping when the weed money really
started changing the game to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where there wasn't so much poverty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the houses that we bought or got
into or the land was very cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it was very rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would do little indoors or do
outdoors and they would end up fixing the
[SPEAKER_01]: bathroom, fixing the roof, putting on a
deck, just taking like a falling down 50s
[SPEAKER_01]: farmhouse that they bought on a handshake
deal and every weed crop improving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many funky houses out in the country
around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now there are a lot of them are
all fixed up and nice because it had 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years of money coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're shitty still, they're
worth a ton of money at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, but they, maybe we could
talk about for a second, just to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather go from like the ambiance of the
area to like, what were the, what were the
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that you were seeing when you
first came out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously like, you know,
just so people know, there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: there wasn't a lot of, there wasn't a lot
of names back then, a lot of individual
[SPEAKER_01]: families and friends had different seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could get a cockamamie story out
of a few of them about what had happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everyone grew from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people got seeds from their friends and
then every two or three years or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, they'd be like, Oh,
I need some more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better like take some of these males in
the bushes and pollinate some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have fresh stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a lot of like the ranches
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be like a couple of people that
were in into making seeds and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else just got seeds from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty common too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some people that were just into
it, into that side of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody else would just go to them,
buy starts from them or get seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty common too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, there was still nerds back then
before we came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was, they were just harder to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, and Matt and I have
had a lot of experience too with like even
[SPEAKER_01]: people that we would consider to be nerds
today, you ask them about specifics of
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were young and they just don't
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they just don't, they just
don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out good or it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it turned out bad,
it was still worth the same obnoxious
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still all sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the good things is it
led to a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want people to know before we
start chatting about this, that like
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage was often hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some like poorly sourced legends
about a lot of it, but everyone that was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed had seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of different Hill
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of different neighborhoods
that had different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like rings said there'd be one or
two guys that was like the neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: nerd and they would do breeding and then
the friends would get seeds from them and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was just a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people just didn't even
realize they could keep a male and make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't, wasn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just, they just thought it
was taboo to even have a male anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: around, even though they could have sold
their seeded shit for big bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: even back then too, as long as it was
green and trim decent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it's just, that's just the way
it was then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't say like, I mean,
that's why like, with being into the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic side, it was like when you saw
something good, it wasn't all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't even that often, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I got something good, I would be
like, where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care where these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drive anywhere to get these seeds,
you know, just to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might go, you might drive up to Oregon
to get some seeds and come back and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't, you didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people didn't keep, most people
didn't keep clones over the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like people would pop a certain
amount of seeds in spring and go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: process of sexing them and try to figure
out how many they thought they could get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with and then plant females where
they had to put them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even I have a buddy who's,
who was telling me like even some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first like hundred lighters he worked at
in Southern Humble, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, indoors, they were like literally like
they made beds on the floor and they
[SPEAKER_01]: planted seeds and they went in and they
cut the males off at the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it wasn't, it wasn't a clone world
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what they knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you hear a few stories like,
like that orange thing you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being like an old clone that super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was, that's kind of
unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about some of your first breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear about some of these
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Raines, what's it, what's some of the
first stuff you worked with when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: actually like, like I have a fucking goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, I want to end up with XYZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's some of the first stuff you
worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just looking at things like in the
way they appeared, you know, at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: I was young and, and uh, you know,
dense and shiny was pretty, pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny to think back of how
sometimes you'd see something great and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be like, Oh, that stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you didn't want, you didn't want
your shit found.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was more about just like finding
something that would come in before the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather that was chunky and decent to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't want sour diesel buds
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, you know, we didn't want to do that
kind of trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really about just making
something that was decent to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: not super needy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're sticking shit way up in the
mountains and visiting it here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping a close lengthy eye on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you didn't want something that
like, I remember the first time I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: like a skunk, one type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we went up there, it was
fucking yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wanted shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the stuff we had going
would be dark green and happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would do all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plants weren't big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't need a lot because we weren't
growing these monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were quarter pounders under the,
in the bushes, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just bring a bag of back guano up
in the hills and some water holding
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals and, and hope that things went
all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, water could be a dream,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water crystals used to be huge because you
weren't able to get to your, because most
[SPEAKER_01]: people hiked into their site and it was
far enough away from your house or it was
[SPEAKER_00]: on a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you only went once a week in
the, your little water line, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: an animal fucked it up or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went six days without water in
105 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said this before, but there's a,
there's a, a big like a Ag store,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you'd call it a garden store in
Willets in Mendo called spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used to have, you used to walk
into their front door and they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: them, you know, they would have a six foot
tall stack of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of camo spray paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what he was just saying is if you
use soft poly, the rats, the wood rats,
[SPEAKER_01]: various other critters, they'd smell the
water and it's so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd come and they chew through your
poly to get water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden your plants
aren't getting wet, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people would use, some people would use
PBC, but then it was white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you needed to spray paint it to make it
look like the ground cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you put it together because
otherwise like, you know, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't, they could smell it,
but they couldn't chew through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing how, how camp was back then
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they would find, like they took their
time and scan the hill so closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find like a few little plants
in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd take their time and just work
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember dyed leaving in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first moved out, I thought it was
cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, the government is trying to find
people like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're diving in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty punk rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's an aspect too people don't
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why like everybody take a shot
every time not so says aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you, you, people would hide them in
the trees, like on little, on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never did that, but I had friends who
would put them on, on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: raised platforms in the trees because the,
the helicopters, they'd be looking at a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain line and they, a lot of times
their eyes would miss it, or they'd put
[SPEAKER_01]: them along the line of a tree line or
manzanitas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd hollow out branches and you'd still
leave the top cover and hopefully they
[SPEAKER_01]: would make it, but they were after it so
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really had to be careful and
then you would take different ways to get
to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: To your spot often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not like you drove your vehicle
there or you drove your ATV or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't even want to walk the same
pathway because they'd see the path from
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would take different routes to get
there and get in and get out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk on the animal trails real
carefully to not make them look weird from
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to try to camouflage things
and, and it was fun to be a little ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we weren't even doing much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just worth something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and really we were just into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to have some, we were willing to
hike up mountains to get a very little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are fucking nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take that kind of heart trauma,
like going up and watching like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eight of your big fucking rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you plant one for these, plant one
for pigs and plant one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in spring, when you're like setting
it all up, that's when you're digging your
[SPEAKER_01]: holes or you're bringing in your,
if you're not, if you're not using the
[SPEAKER_01]: right, the earth there, that's when you
had to hike in your, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your, your soil, you had to bring in
your amendments so you could feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you were using native earth,
it was hard to feed on nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Run your water lines, maybe drill a spring
and then you're crawling in the bushes,
[SPEAKER_01]: carving out little spaces for your
patches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole drill is spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people my age, like from California,
we don't even get what the fuck that
[SPEAKER_02]: means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill a fucking spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in a spring box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the spring collects water in the spring
box and then run piping from that box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes hundreds of yards, especially if
you're downhill, you would try to find- Do
[SPEAKER_00]: you use water witching shit to find the
springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was little springs on
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would, you would like build a box and
then just rig up a pipe going out the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would collect a little bit and just
slowly trickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we had them feeding little tanks
or something, but- Because you needed
[SPEAKER_01]: springs because you, it's not like you
could put in a well because even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had solar or something like that,
they'd see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even like, I just don't get how
people found springs out in fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how did you find these things under
the ground for wet spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I met people that knew where springs were,
you know, or on properties where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like little hidden parts of the property
that had a little water source.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically a spring box is just digging
a hole big enough to put a certain size,
[SPEAKER_01]: like manmade box in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to collect the water and let
it build up to a usable amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can drain it out one end and
then gravity feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's upstarted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's upstarted like a siphon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a low, low grade to somewhere,
it was tricky to get the bubbles out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember working on that very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of hiking back and forth to see if it
worked now or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there ever turf wars over springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yes, there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about that when,
when two 15 happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of, I, you don't hear this
talked about very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these water sources in the
mountains, people kind of, I had them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was kind of their turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they had those spots and when
two 15 happened, the cartels came with
[SPEAKER_00]: guns and pretty much kicked everybody off
their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it, but two 15 was allowing all
the people that had those spots to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: right in their fucking yard then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a little transfer of
territories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, people used to, there used to
be a thing where, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: people would have arguments over how far
away the patch should be from your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if they did camp it, they would
just take the patch and not mess with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would be arguments about how
much you should hike and how far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not like it was just like off
in the bushes, you know, a hundred yards
[SPEAKER_01]: from your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things you'd hike into or
hike up to, and it would be a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the little, how like the
little trails were so like, you really had
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't, if they saw a trail,
they'd just walk right to it and there
[SPEAKER_00]: would be, you know, you had to really
ninja that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be careful, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, yeah, it's like, I remember
like a lot of times, especially when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: hiking up like a dry amendments or
something like that in the spring,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just want to puke because you're
like, you're going uphill and you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 50 pound thing of food on your back
and you're hiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you get to mid summer
and it doesn't even feel like anything
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're in shape and you've done it
for months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the beginning you would,
and that was as a young buck, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, this is fucking rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing that's kind of funny that
people should know is that for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like you use something like a,
like fish meal or bone meal or blood meal
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you realize like,
Oh, that attracts bears.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and bears are some kind of big
animal comes in looking for what smells
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got composting fish meal or
composting crab meal or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a big ass bear starts to dig in
your soil and ruins your patch because you
[SPEAKER_01]: use the wrong kind of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people I learned from right
away was it was like bat guano right away
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were kind of hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a lot of people who didn't care
about that kind of stuff, they use those
[SPEAKER_00]: little Osmocote pellets balls and they
would just put those in there and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they had to do was just add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was some people that once
you, I mean, and I'll say this too,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was people that had established
spots that they were able to do small
[SPEAKER_01]: patches in year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of those people had some
really nice soils, some really nice holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They amended them well every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like an active, organic
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was some better pot that came
out of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, setting it up sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water was really good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water quality really affected the weed
back then too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't using city water,
treated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like mountain water,
you know, and just like any other living
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of water is, it makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it had minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had little bits of stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I learned too that the old
timers always taught me that pot was like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lateral root growth plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would always say like in the
bushes, it's better to dig like an 18 inch
[SPEAKER_01]: or a two foot deep hole that was wide
rather than one that was deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're like, the plant's going
to want to go wide and you'll get more
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so like make a shallow depression and
fill it in rather than digging like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was people that would dig
like four or five, six foot deep holes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that would have been me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have used that longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like crawling in the Manzanitas
with like a shovel that can strap to your
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're underneath there and
you're just like chomping at the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean six feet with the tiny little,
and then you got to like, I was young at
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because nothing fucking mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, you just got it done or
whatever, but it wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had to remove this,
the, you know, like, because a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of Mendo is red clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we have like a ton of black,
loamy, deep, rich earth that you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: like plant into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like mountainous and rocky and clay
like, and so you definitely had to add
[SPEAKER_01]: some stuff to it and amend it if you
wanted to get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you could just like dig a
hole and plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into strains guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to hear about the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always so funny because without
clones to reference people, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just telling them about a ghost,
you know, like a little bit, a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I had a moment today where I
was harvesting some volunteer accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that popped up in my yard and the
rain got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only early thing I had in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had some big soft, cool colors on it
and the rain kind of started getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: them a little botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm smelling the piece I picked a few
days ago and I'm smelling it and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this smells just like Afghans 30 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what the volunteer was
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, some cookie Kush crap crossed
with my blue dynamite super lemon OG crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had one male last year,
so it had to be from that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can dig some blue dynamite crap over
cookie Kush shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people hate cookies and I don't
like what it stands for either,
[SPEAKER_00]: but ultimately if it's gassy and it has a
good, I mean, if it's gassy, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: decent smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stay high off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't stay high off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no legs for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's strong and some of it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I, when I first found
cookies, like forum and animal and tried
[SPEAKER_00]: those things, I actually appreciated not
being so fucking, I don't need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: sledgehammer fucking freaked out,
stoned all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I want to, but I mean,
I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't just because I'm not
tripping the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not high, you know, not everything has
to have me fucking just the forum forum
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get, I get high, like it's a good
high for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to go pick your kid up from
school in a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good if they want to stay high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are times, and I talk about this
with rings quite a bit actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: where like I'll smoke something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My headband, like the LA and I'll go into
town stupidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've done this hundreds of times to
myself over the years, I'll get all baked
[SPEAKER_01]: on something, the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll go into town and I'll be standing
in line at this weird little store and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be like the Twilight zone in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why am I here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I will say about cookies is
that I don't like cookies that much
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but two things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that since we were just talking
about the gorilla era, I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: flipped out to have something cookies what
came up in the wrong era.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we would have had that shit in the
gorilla era, because cookies requires low
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super dense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to get that big to weigh a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could have put it in the deep shade,
not fed it very much and just loaded
[SPEAKER_01]: manzanita patches with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have come in early enough to
not mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it would have been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things people are growing
when I moved out here did not come in
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody grew specifically for early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of my own like mission was
to create something like early that was
[SPEAKER_00]: strong and looked good and decent to work
with and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot, when I moved out here,
I was hanging out on a mountain and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were, were bringing in fucking baseball
colas from the out of the rain at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of October, you know, and the people I
learned from were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, they knew how to let things
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't going to freak out and pull
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really, they, they taught me a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I just got lucky and met people
that really were into it and, and cared
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also down to take their time to
show me some stuff and tell me why they
[SPEAKER_00]: did this or why they didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of, of just hill weed that
had a good amount of sativa in it of all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of weed that didn't
finish until say like late October to
[SPEAKER_01]: early November.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it resisted the rain pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mendo, most falls, there's a lot of
warm, dry fall in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might rain for two or three
days and then be sunny for weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of sativa weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because all the weeds sold,
there wasn't like, I think what started
[SPEAKER_01]: with the purple craze and then,
you know, the various things is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is everyone started getting the same
cuttings and blending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This era is the total opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all kinds of random, unique weed,
some of it pretty midsy, but all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff just floated around
because all weeds sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every, every smell you can imagine
today was already there back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you took the time to see as
much as possible, which I was into,
[SPEAKER_00]: if people were like, I was just into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just like, Oh,
somebody's got some different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go and look through it and ask them
questions if I like some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember smelling super intense
cherry back, back then super intense lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the earthy, skunky Afghani smells,
and just, just kind of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and all different leafs,
all different kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, talk about some of the most
unique shit that you remember seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: during your early days there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some of the most, not necessarily
by name, but describe it if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I keep on thinking about this,
this, some stuff that my friends grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually down into Watsonville and a
girlfriend down there that was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was down there a lot when they were
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the guys was ex military ed
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends up in Humboldt and they had
some little gorilla thing in a Canyon in
[SPEAKER_00]: Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it was done, he brought us all
this stuff and it was just like satiba,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there was, there was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was kind of purple, but it
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys knew how to cure things
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had called it gray, but,
and one of the, one of those two satiba
[SPEAKER_00]: strains was called golden lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody up in Humboldt would recognize
that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, yeah, golden lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, you know, I just figured it
was from some Rasta crew up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but I remember that gray bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends and I smoking it and like not
even talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just left our f*****g bodies in
leather and it was f*****g amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most memorable things to tie
Afghans from spy rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I saw that just
had everything beauty smell really wild
[SPEAKER_00]: highs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my buddy would take his
scissors hat off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like what we called monkey's
blood opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like translucent red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember smoking that and being
sitting on the ground and just holding the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground waiting to come just to get my
bearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so potent, but the, those Thai
Afghans blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, these characters were so
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowbird, a guy who called himself Lowbird,
a weird jungle monkey from Hawaii growing
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian sativas in the, in the like 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had great stories of Swazis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, all of him in the old heads,
they liked Swazis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like the gold in Hawaii in like
the early nineties or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew some Hawaiian sativa seeds here
and would bring the plants in every night
[SPEAKER_00]: because they weren't going to get done
until I think he harvested them at
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were f*****g great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take, they had really floral sweet
smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them had really nice little shade
of purple in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them stayed green no matter how
cold it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that too is like, because weed
was, was so valuable then it was a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to dry and handle things if you
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really was a nice way because there
wasn't so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it wasn't some overwhelming amount of
s**t.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could treat it nicer, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, and that made a difference
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things maybe we should note is
that, um, when you'd get pounds or you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: see pounds, most of them were all mixed
phenos because they weren't from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would get, they would be pounds and
they would be all the same wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but they would trim it up and
they would blend it up and you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at this and this would smell like
that and this would smell like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd be like, Oh wait,
what is that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start digging in the bag,
looking for weed that looks like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: picking out and trying to gather yourself
a little pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like that one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always joked, we always joked how
people would, uh, there'd be like an
[SPEAKER_00]: overripe purple bud in a mixed bag that
had no residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on it just smelled like garbage cause
it was way overripe and somebody would see
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd focus in on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, look at that purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: F**k yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just laughed cause it was garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that would probably be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's an aspect too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people would be like,
Oh, some of these pounds are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: midsy, but these plants are really
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a few ounces and
put them into, into the top of each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when people open the bag,
there's like a nice selection and it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: them think that the whole bag is like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it's like, these are nice and
the rest of them are just okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but it all went because people wanted
good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't, it wasn't hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any options to get better
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no, there was no, like you
weren't getting rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just dried yourself stuff nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice got kept it green, got it dry enough
to where it wouldn't turn yellow right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your s**t was, was golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it was really
appreciated by people, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I remember that one time I grew
that skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny because people were like,
this s**t is weak and they were just
[SPEAKER_00]: bummed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of similar experiences recently
with another off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have money and they were
spending 50 bucks on an eighth even here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they took a smoke,
you know, they would brash and s**t out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were taking a couple of hits of
something and not getting tore back,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were kind of bummed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also one thing that I don't know
if a lot of people realize seeds prices
[SPEAKER_02]: probably have instead of with flation
risen, have maybe dropped now compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always been pretty, especially
sensey.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always been pretty expensive for
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've dropped massively because if you
think about the purchasing power of what
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the seed cost hasn't changed all
that, that much, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, obviously there's some people
that have some hype that try to like
[SPEAKER_01]: counter inflation or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, for me, I didn't buying
seeds from Europe back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some of my older brother's friends
went to Europe and brought back seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the eighties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had their little, they lived in
Metro areas, you know, Minneapolis,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would have their little closet
grows about 400 or a couple of four
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had that Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I moved out here,
I was just like, man, it didn't seem like
[SPEAKER_00]: that Dutch stuff even mattered out here,
but it did everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, most of the Dutch stuff
was imported from either California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington or the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't really have a need to go to
the Dutch to get a fucked up version of
[SPEAKER_02]: what was already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you never, I never heard people say
like, oh, we went to, we put Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in this or we put skunk one in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it was mostly older stuff and
it really didn't have much, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already was a total nerd, a high times
nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew all those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lusted at wanting to try them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able to try some Northern lights
and skunk Northern lights mixes that my
[SPEAKER_00]: brother's friends had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my other, one of their friends grew G
13 clones in the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most that was, yeah, they were
actually the first crew I knew that did
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had a great plan, they,
they kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were into their gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually this crew from before I
even moved out to Mendo from Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_01]: that had this, they called it blueberry
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to get it in 93, 94,
95, 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never was able to get a clone of it out
in California, but they had little,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in Madison and some of these
rural areas outside of Madison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would have these little four and
six lighters and they would all grow this
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what it was related to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never grew it myself, but I got buds
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but that what's interesting
about that too, is that when, when you,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you found somebody that was
intelligent in the sense that like they
[SPEAKER_01]: cared about the intelligent is the wrong
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were, when they cared about
lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they were f*****g autistic nerds like
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they cared about lineage,
not intelligence, but just like a weed
[SPEAKER_01]: nerdism to like, they'd tell you something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, it's a Mexican with a Swazi or
it's a Colombian Mex with some Afghan that
[SPEAKER_01]: we, and they get, you know, but most of it
was the name of the closest little
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain or town that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first moved here, there was so much
weed that was like, Oh, this is from White
[SPEAKER_01]: Thorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Panther Gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the Hills above Covolo.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some Sherwood road.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some long Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some, you know, some older point
weed and it was just named kind of by the
[SPEAKER_01]: little town or the little area or the
little Hills that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted their names associated with
anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I brought out the Maui,
because I, you know, I brought out the
[SPEAKER_01]: Maui and the crystal chunk to California
because from Chicago, that was all we knew
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, the only reason why you started
seeds was to find a killer clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you use the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were all indoor and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, and so I came here and
clones, like he said, clones were rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were shocked that I was like
running rooms of the same thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had like first keepers were just
plants that were kept because nobody kept
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have kept anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you had those, I mean,
there just wasn't many clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, you know, I always think of your
Maui, ask goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the ask goo up here, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was early and it looked like indoor
because it was so resinous and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very popular because it came in at a
decent time outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, it has amazing turps too,
unless you get sick of it because pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much everything with after he smells like
out here and you can't get sick of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's all you're smelling,
like that cantaloupe be weird mango eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Northern lights blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that went around here that
smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It either was the same or it smelled very
similar early on back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that was sort of like when
you, when you did a bunch of outdoor seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that, that was my first
experience with like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really are dominant traits,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember some of my first readings
thinking that I could breed away from
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things I wasn't fond of and breed
towards other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes that works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pat myself on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that trait was just
ingrained and I was like, Oh, I can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you were saying things like
AFGOO smell like AFGOO or turpentine or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there was things where
you're like, Oh, I can't get it out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember getting really sick of AFGOO
pounds because I was bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought all clones were like great
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they were great to smoke here
and there, but as far as the mission I was
[SPEAKER_00]: on, it was all clones were boring unless
you just made seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the seeds you grew out of them
were fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I just wasn't a clone guy
ever pretty much like I loved sour so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that I kept that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times having other friends
hold it at times or this or that I kept it
[SPEAKER_00]: around because it was just like a daily
driver to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just something I like smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd ask you the top three favorite
strains, but I'm not sure I can get any
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names out of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually talk to him about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the clones, you know,
I always hung out with people that grew
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones and enjoyed them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as like things that are
identifiable, there certainly is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, some, not even identifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean like top three favorite
smokes, not even necessarily strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but smokes events, what it smelled like,
tasted like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really like there's strain
names, just identifiable stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other people know exactly what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can transcend that just by talking
about what it smelled like, tastes like
[SPEAKER_02]: the highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I could interject just really quick
though, is that before we get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: it, which is there was two sour diesels I
saw early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the one that I still have,
which I've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there was this other one that,
that rings was much more familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: that existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was took longer, was more feathery,
hermed more, was more delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could talk about that for a minute,
because the sour that I ended up keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: was one of two that I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that he had was much
different, but we, but it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was spread around back then,
but it was significantly different in
[SPEAKER_01]: growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a similar nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely similar, but it was very
different in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we considered it to be like piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, it was, that was, I mean,
the whole sour thing was just crazy how it
[SPEAKER_00]: just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the first time I got it actually
was from a guy, Mean Gene Nose 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew up near him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy gave it to me and I was like,
this shit is ugly because still at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, everybody basically wanted something
dense, round with a lot of resin on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy handed me the sour and I was
just like, fuck, this shit's all feathery
[SPEAKER_00]: as peach colored hairs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looked weird to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as we smoked it, it was just
like, I remember looking at it and just
[SPEAKER_00]: being, wow, this is going past what the
norm is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this, it was the first like
commercial thing that didn't look like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything people wanted for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense, round, crisply, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just such good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make people forget about those
other things they thought they desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it played a really good role
in that, like kind of breaking down some
[SPEAKER_00]: walls that were just always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it didn't always look great in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sticky little fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really, you had to hit it right
to get a lot of resin on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it didn't have a lot of resin
on it, it had big flavor and it had that
[SPEAKER_00]: zippy high that was real clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brokers would buy it on the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seemed like... But then Trimmers
would cry because they wanted that big,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that he was just talking about,
all that big chunky resinous, that stuff's
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to trim and people can get through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour gets popular and a bunch of people
are growing that cut and it's feathery and
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty and loose and sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be all gentle with it and
not fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give Trimmers... Why they were
fucking doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to...
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour introduced psychotherapy to trim
bossing because you had to convince your
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimmers, like, this is gonna be worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it looked ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, I mean, it still had all the
turps and the good buzz and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it did not form up into a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I saw some people growing in
greenhouses and feeding it intense food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of more on the hippie,
organic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't dropping big... We weren't
throwing grow more on it or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember people pulling a lot of
different looking stuff out of that same
[SPEAKER_00]: clone just by the way they were feeding
it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could get some pretty big dense buds
out of it if they nuked it with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, top three strains,
I'd almost say sour, sour, sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there wasn't any... I'm not really
that attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into keeping on moving and seeing what
comes out of these seeds that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: collected or bought or whatever over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get that attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all give me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain highs I like better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm willing to have a bad buzz just to
try something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's something I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to keep moving because I want
to see plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a hobbyist when I got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like more plants all from
seed, preferably.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like information to me to go to
those kind of gardens and just see
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions, see different tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, you're just like,
oh, that's heavy Afghani at this guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something like me and Caleb
and a bunch of other people that are big
[SPEAKER_02]: into identification through visual and
bringing for traits and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one advantage that we had was seeing a
lot of different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I told you the other day,
my mentor, Hogg, he would always tell me,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you want to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn by growing the baselines,
baselines, baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like skunk one, haze, you want to grow as
many different types of Afghanis as you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to grow as many ties as you can
and Mexicans and Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't grow those, you don't know
shit about pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what he told me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see, you know, one of the things
that always interests me when Rings and I
[SPEAKER_01]: are in one of our many combos is that
there are certain lines that he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: playing with for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you really get to see,
because you've crossed it to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, what are the traits that
are dominant that keep popping up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it give to crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's things that he'll be
like to me, he'll be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't like this line,
but here's four things that I just love
[SPEAKER_01]: that it just throws in its progeny all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of lean towards it,
you know, because of these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and there's stuff he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we did, it's gotten,
we, you know, we did a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little collab, if you personal collab,
where he had some, you could talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some old maple leaf indica from
sensei seeds and that era where they were
[SPEAKER_01]: still selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we blended with a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's been, you know,
sours and cushions and various different
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I basically, you know, he makes seed
basically every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of this stuff, someone was asking
in the comments, when did you first get
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dynamite?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said early 2000s, but yeah, that's when
I got sick of just kind of bringing my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to itself over and over and kind of
just being like, okay, this stuff has this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I want to see other people's
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what these people in Canada
are fucking with or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had read about maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ordered some maple seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because I've bought in so
many things over the years to check them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things that I hear old schoolers
talking about, the only things I really
[SPEAKER_00]: have that are still fresh and poppable in
my collection to this day, I have blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamite in them or maple leaf in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is just come and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that I think those things
are, are the greatest or this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, none of it's the greatest to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all more, more, more,
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to see more plants,
but they were reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were reliable to do what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the maple was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very good looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally it had a nice smell and it had a
great smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said a lot of turpentine expressions,
but there was some cushy in there or more
[SPEAKER_02]: dense Afghani type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when, when not so when I did
that little collab, I remember Caleb hit
[SPEAKER_00]: him up and said, do you see any actual
maple leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we, we kind of, we kind of did
like a little open pollination with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it was very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got four boys and three girls
to pop out of some of the old seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we let them pollinate each other like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we threw in a bunch of like,
uh, clones that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I, you know, chems, chem 91,
Chem D, Mendo P, uh, the Tanjo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The super silver haze, the headband,
uh, you know, just a, a collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because G from seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw a few things from seed in there
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown, I mean, not so as in pop
many of those, but I popped, I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds and hundreds of plants out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Loompa headband maples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a, Karma OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had let go and a buddy of mine wanted
to, but you said that Karma OG never heard
[SPEAKER_02]: of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy a few years ago call and he
was off the grid and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just depth a whole bunch of seed
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get some seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave them tons and I gave them the
Loompa headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the maple and the Karma OG I had made
with the maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it's like the classic OG story
where they're all kind of the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they got all these names,
those two rows, those two rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might as well been from the batch,
same batch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was basically like two main
expressions and they looked like each
[SPEAKER_00]: other, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like running seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to just see that kind of shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed, um, I, the other day I was
trying to add it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was something like, like nine different
OGs to the blue bonnets just to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: each different one combined to the same
exact male.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty true breeding through the
same expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, there was very little variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like most of the, like the SFV and
the Louie and all that, that you can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to tell them apart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little different smells and
stuff, you know, in the different cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the genetic there, whatever was in
them wasn't that funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting in that regard because,
uh, you know, just so people know too,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like, I don't think that those
maple seeds that we use were like from the
[SPEAKER_01]: original pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had probably been a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just bred to themselves several
times to just keep them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was 15 years after I bought
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the med woman?
[SPEAKER_00]: Med woman who brought, oh yeah,
bad dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe he posted a picture of
this med woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Med woman was a Northern lights something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look it up, it won a contest up in
Oregon or Washington years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it won for being like a good medical
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy up in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sourced some really great clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in oh six, oh seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was living up in Mount Shasta area and
my buddy from Eugene came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought from Roseburg, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought med woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought a grapefruit cut that is unlike
any grapefruit I've ever seen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the, it's one of the few ones
I wish I had because usually I just don't
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to pop more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grapefruit was fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheese, he got, he brought down some
really great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw, I threw my, this, this whole,
this thing and my friend and I made the
[SPEAKER_00]: bylaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw that on everything because that's
what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had moved back down here and we brought
these beat up moms down here and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: really had the capacity to like take cuts
and keep stuff or we weren't interested at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a transitional time in my
life and so we just threw what pollen we
[SPEAKER_00]: had on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a whole shitload of those
somewhere in the freezer.
The seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapefruit's the one that got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last batch of those seeds I gave to a
buddy to grow out the year we had our
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no more grapefruit hybrids?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've tried to find that, that cutting
in Oregon several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be very hard with such a generic
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to grow out relic, grapefruit to
see it because he was in the similar area
[SPEAKER_00]: and he had a lot, he had a lot of the same
things he worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shishkeberry, cheese, grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, he probably had the same ones I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no crazy grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was old school smells in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool, but it was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different kind of grapefruit
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people call different C99s
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have grapefruit, Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many different
grapefruits to buy grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the good thing about it is,
is that it's like, I was talking about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of funny when people find some
kind of turp or combination and then start
[SPEAKER_01]: to claim that like anything that does that
comes from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, like if there's grapefruit,
there's going to be grapefruit again,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because we lost the turp combination
of certain ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's common enough that it popped up in
enough different things that I'm confident
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll exist again in some format.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the blueberry story,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, one person claims all smells
of blueberry and cannabis is all his
[SPEAKER_02]: descendants, you know, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that like I seen blueberry pop
out of Irene sour diesel, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like super blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible to find it in all kinds of
different combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always run into it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially if your seeds have a
good deep pool, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I grew out the maple and
Mendo perps, I probably popped,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, two, 300 of them or at least
200 of them are, you know, to be
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get such and that's fun to me at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to make something
consistent, I almost would rather make
[SPEAKER_00]: something wild at this time that you can
actually get something unique out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, Caleb makes a really good
point, dude, where he talks about like he
[SPEAKER_01]: used the Mendo perps as an example,
because it has a really wide genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, if I gave 100 S ones to like
seven or eight different friends and asked
[SPEAKER_01]: them to select what they like and breed
with it, you would probably end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: wildly different selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would take it in their own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't be similar at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the maples kind of like that
the maple, the maple from sensei is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably it's probably like two or three
different of Neville's maple cuts and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably pretty wide,
you know, and then the Mendo's wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cross that and you just get like a
whole host of it isn't really is what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maple was dominantly like I told Matt
the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had long inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had fluffy kind of turpinoline based
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some looked pretty ropey dopey,
but everybody liked it as far as just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every once in a while, I'd say the
rare thing in that line was to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that actually had a little
density to it and a resinous appearance to
[SPEAKER_00]: it and more of a like a fat leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't the common thing, but it was
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had that same experience with
Black Domino, the exact same experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one that I expected to find some
faster finishing, almost blackish purple,
[SPEAKER_02]: like really resinous, cushy looking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I thought was exactly what you
described, which were like 13,
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 week, airy, fluffy, turpinoline,
not a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one actually didn't have a lot of
variance from what I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just all tended to be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure there was other stuff in it
just in the fact that I popped that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to pop like 30 or better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, what are you going to
find?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember people ordering sensi Afghani
ones based on the pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all just super tall, super leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't, they were, they did not get
fat leaf buff, structured shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of really goofy,
ugly Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only seen like a few really prime
cuts ever selected from that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that, you know, a lot of the
Afghan that first came over to Mendo and
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt and stuff, a lot of the old
timers, I think that's a consistent thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with Afghani in the sense that like,
there's a lot of kind of boofy Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Nick ran that G13 NL2 from Neville,
some of the last original seeds he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is exactly as, as he's describing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was turpinoline, loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but there's, I mean, there's an aspect
where then you, you find a phenome that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want and breed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, you know, it's like,
that's kind of like everybody wants land
[SPEAKER_01]: race, but nobody wants diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that means it's like, they don't
want to like pop a few packs and it all
[SPEAKER_01]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get excited about ugly plants at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those really ugly things
smoked really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this really dense,
crazy stuff to me, that's not like the
[SPEAKER_02]: most, I need to get you some of that Rose
flow I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I gave the rest to Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably maybe have it pure, but it is
some of the ugliest fucking shit I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns up with any nutrients,
but it's bright red, pretty leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so much pretty about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for flows, there's like no density to
it, but it breeds great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ugliest fuck, not much resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's one of those that you,
it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, you know, we didn't need
to really be visually that appealing until
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I view the Instagram era as like a massive
change in what we'd had to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was lots of weed that was somewhat
ugly, but if it worked and smoked and
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted really nice and got you zippy high,
like you were stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was talking about that sour,
you know, that sour, it was, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was STEMI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was looking in some ways, but it got
you ripped high and tasted great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the market and people just always,
especially when spending 50 bucks was a
[SPEAKER_00]: loss to them because they didn't have much
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted it to be like a, they wanted
the appearances that we used to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: fake, fake tits and bleach bond hair weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they wanted dense, crystalline
buds just to look at because Blackberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly dude, you know,
I remember I never fucked with that glow
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saw tons of it, but I remember
getting an ounce of weed in San Francisco
[SPEAKER_01]: in the nineties once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, we, you know, we just called
it hydro, you know, it was some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor and there was only like nine buds
and we were like so pumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because each bud was like two to
four grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like looking at like these chunky
or like, Oh God, somebody gave me like the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder stash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, it was one of those
things where it was like, it wasn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: common to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted visually appealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember anything about that weed
except for how impressed we were that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was nice buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked nice and big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just bright green and bright green.
[SPEAKER_01]: White orange hairs and frosty and all
these big chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people, when they got an
eighth that just had one chunk in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were kind of butthurt, you know,
like they, they, or they questioned if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were giving them 2.8 instead of 3.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, but if it was good, if it,
if it was strong, they have just been
[SPEAKER_00]: forget, you know, they, they'd want more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked, what were the earliest
purple strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rainsaw and Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the real, the earliest ones were
just overripe depleted plants that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: turned purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't, we, we thought,
Oh, somebody said they had purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be like, Oh, it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was always like
something left on the vine depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really good, but Leightonville,
Leightonville had a, in fact, that ties
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the underwear guy in the shack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, there was a, a real common type in
Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I kind of, sometimes I think of
this with the Mendo perp story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of my own take or whatever,
but there, there was a green and a purple
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were both really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell the purple was supposed to
be there instead of something that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a reflection of some,
something not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, was that the strain that people
called the purple from Leightonville?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's the second time I've heard
the Leightonville purple, like a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: Leightonville purple mentioned in relation
to like one of the early purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of families that I'd met back then
had the similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd be like, they'd have either this
bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never real dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was like a purple side that
was really pretty that would be in there
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and it all, it often had a real
sweet, like fruity type of smell to it
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an aspect too, that people
should know that what, what rings is
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about when like overdone shit is
fricking, people would do first and second
[SPEAKER_01]: and third cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times there would be
purple weed that would be like all the
[SPEAKER_01]: smalls that everybody left to ripen and
they'd stick out in the cold and they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: turn dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like all the under light,
under fed stuff that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would cut that and put it
into pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was the same price as the tops
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just thought, but,
but it was still, yeah, people would
[SPEAKER_00]: really milk their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see not too many people
cleaned up their plants to try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their tops the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they would just pick those tops,
let those other things go until they did
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some strains really actually did okay
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them would just shit out as
soon as you picked on them, they would,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else would be shitty,
but they would still pick it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this aspect where people
thought, Oh, we can leave this stuff on
[SPEAKER_01]: and let it ripen cause it's under done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never got enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just leave it out and it's not going
to rock cause it's too small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that stuff would ripen and turn
colors because it would get pretty cold at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, you know, and then they would go
out and harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was often like late batch under,
under undergrown, you know, like remnants
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, that, I mean, being a
hobbyist and moving out here and just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing all that shit, it was just my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just the happiest boy in my twenties
running around these Hills, looking at as
[SPEAKER_00]: much shit as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being, being that age and,
and, and like, obviously I missed my era
[SPEAKER_02]: because that would have been something I
would have loved to have lived through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool to be able to pick
your brain and be able to sit here and ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you questions about it and kind of,
uh, live via proxy through an era that I
[SPEAKER_02]: missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're all born when we're born.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get our turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you still got to see cooler punk
rock shit than I did too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know what, I mean,
growing up in the town that I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was, it was almost unthinkable that
it could have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just my older brother and their
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they stumbled on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I, that's how I got sucked
into is, was who became my older
[SPEAKER_02]: brother-in-law, me and punk rock scene
with little kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still was for all those years to moving
out here and being able to run down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: city, down to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'd see bands I knew from
the Midwest played in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always fun too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just little reunions in a straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else you wanted to
cover?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so one of the things that we could
cover that kind of ties into what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is that both rings and I
arrived in Mendo when it was, I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: it before, but when it was kind of poor
and weird, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was very odd place and you
know, and then, you know, people think
[SPEAKER_01]: too, like people used to come to Mendo all
the time and be like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did this thing where we passed this
thing, measure G, which kind of basically
[SPEAKER_01]: forbade the cops from messing with you too
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only had 25 plants and you had your
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people would come to Mendo every
week and be like, weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would be like, Oh my God,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's very much a cat and mouse
game that goes on between you and your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors and where you're at,
what part of the County, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhoods that you could get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was neighborhoods where like
retired doctors or lawyers or whoever
[SPEAKER_01]: would just report anything that they saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and if you didn't know like which
streets and which areas were kosher and
[SPEAKER_01]: not, you could come up here and like way
get like, like in the wrong spot and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the most amazing things was that you could
go to the sheriff's department and buy 25
[SPEAKER_00]: zip ties for 625 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could yellow, big yellow zip ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my, my ex had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the sheriff's department,
getting these zip ties from some old lady
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd go and wrap them around your
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just felt like, fuck the
neighbors, whatever they can bitch all
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got these things, the cops,
if you have only 25, like you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you felt pretty empowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that created probably, I would say in,
I don't know, I've been here four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: years or longer then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was probably oh two, oh three maybe
was when it really started what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: like the green wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably like, oh two, oh three to
maybe like, oh nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just an immense wave of
outsiders that came into the County all at
[SPEAKER_01]: once buying up property.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drove up the cost of properties by
enormous amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really started blowing it up huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed the culture of the place
because anytime you get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: outsiders coming in too fast, they can't
learn from the people that were already
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was like friction between the
people that had been here for a while and
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that were just sort of like,
there was people that were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought this land.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the country, which means I'm
American and I can like fire guns and get
[SPEAKER_01]: drunk and drive 70 miles an hour up the
thing and I can drain the community spring
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing weed and fuck my neighbors and
suck a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be like, oh no, no, no,
no, that doesn't actually work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people- Yeah, you'll end up in a
hole motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginning of clones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginning of like the seeds,
the seed, the past was just disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: into clones at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember being really bummed because
I knew I could see it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all this diversity is just
going away to Barry White, Afgu and Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all these people would have grown 25
plants from seed anytime before this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now they're just monocropping one
clone out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, they would come here
and they would want to make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them wouldn't even stay here over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they would come seasonally to
make money and bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changed the culture of the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought a lot of money and it
definitely improved thousands upon
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of rural properties that got
built up and made nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ukiah, the main hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, it put a switch, it polished
the turd, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, when I first moved,
Willett's, which is the town north of us
[SPEAKER_01]: and you in Mendo was half of it was
boarded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some really hideous buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was way on the downturn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what's funny, the reason why I
brought it up is because we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking a bunch about how we watched all
these people flow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with the collapse of the weed
economy and the prices dropping to so
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy and everybody getting used to
growing volume, which rings hates and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a bunch of B and C grade weed and
just hoping it was good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all these people are flowing back out
of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone that came in for easy
money is like, Oh, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there were, there was a lot of rich
kids, a lot of, you know, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to have some, it was either like
big hustlers from, from cities all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the country or rich kids, because you had,
it still costs a lot of money to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to get a property and actually set
it up and pay people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to, you know, they had to,
you couldn't be broke and come to Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: and start a scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they, there's a lot of people up here
that didn't want to admit that they got
[SPEAKER_01]: their parents to buy them properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started blowing,
and then they started blowing it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: like going on vacations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to think a lot of those people,
I was like, man, they're just so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better at what they're doing than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized that like their
parents bought them the, like it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: play money to them while I was trying to
like live and survive and breed and do
[SPEAKER_01]: these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there was no backstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had the parent that like put
them, put the property in their name that
[SPEAKER_01]: put the down payment down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety nets would be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't realize that none of them,
none of them really wanted to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them right now are going back to
work for their mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dad's corporations after 15 years of
blowing it up in Mendo and a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: too, to be honest, they would come up here
for two or three years and actually grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would farm it out to a good
friend or friends that weren't doing as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and still take a huge percentage,
but it was their property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would live in Santa Rosa or the
Bay or Southern California or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would come up at important times
to their property and make sure it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they weren't really from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just kind of came up and blew it up and
made some money and then left and then
[SPEAKER_01]: used the funnel to like funnel money to
themselves so they could live where they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know lots of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of getting back to like
broken weird again in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is painful to see, but it's not
like, it's not like you Kyle will turn
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a poor town with a big factory
on the edge of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blowing, you know, exhaust over the whole
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be back there because now it's
just, it's like the new affordable place
[SPEAKER_00]: for city people to put their money because
all the towns between here and San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco are ludicrously expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like every time a person sells a
house in town, there's a person from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay area willing to just buy it because
it's only $600,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas anywhere south of here,
it's 800 or a million for the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's an aspect where if you live
in like the valleys where, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we live right now, he's making fun
of me because I got this verbal tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got rid of one and then others came in
my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's part where around Ukiah,
around Redwood Valley, around certain
[SPEAKER_01]: valleys, I think the properties are
maintaining value, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: like mountainous properties that when
people tried to get them permitted,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just not permittable that without
hundreds of thousands of dollars of
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them don't even have enough water
on them to grow a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if people came up here and spent
$350,000 buying a raw 20 acres that had no
[SPEAKER_00]: water on it and they set it up and buy
water and have it delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that the weed isn't bringing
money, what is that property worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another kind of conflict in
our area where the regulations want people
[SPEAKER_01]: to come out of the traditional pot growing
areas in the hills and they want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: come down to the valleys and like get
legal on like ag land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a bunch of retired
doctors and lawyers and wine people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a grow down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's supposed to hide up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought this retirement property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all supposed to be rolling grapes and
orchards and not these degenerates with
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have a permit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Sonoma County, Sonoma County had a
big problem, you know, at first when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were starting to go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, who owns Sonoma County rich
conservative wine growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those people were
actually investing in weed once it really
[SPEAKER_00]: got legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they hated it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably still hate it,
but they're going to invest in it now to
[SPEAKER_02]: make some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an aspect where you see a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point to that, I guess, was that I'm
curious in two or three years what a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these mountain properties look like
because the price of weed has collapsed so
[SPEAKER_01]: much and it might cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars just to fix your road
[SPEAKER_01]: so that like, you know, the fire
department and whoever else will sign off
[SPEAKER_01]: on you having one license grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the angle of your road is more than
14 degrees, you have to get it paved or
[SPEAKER_01]: this or this or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of these places where it used
to be traditional and good to hide and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow mountain weed and it's clean and it's
pure up there, it's not suitable for the
[SPEAKER_01]: current form of legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you get lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of them had enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They barely had enough water to just
supply a normal household, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let alone a big garden out on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they were all trucking it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, people in the last few years were
spending trying to grow these 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot off of bought water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were spending like $1,200 a day or
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People trucking in water and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People trucking in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water trucks running around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a water truck driver that I
knew the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, ma'am, there ain't shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I didn't make shit last year
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of people bought water trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the rage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was enough profit in it that it made
sense to do a lot of things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I used to, I used to have this
running joke that like it'd be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd find something and it'd be like a
composting toilet, you know, cute little
[SPEAKER_01]: shack, you know, solar power, 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'd be like $700.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people would be like, oh,
you could put 50 plants on that thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: make tons of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paid off in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now what is that property going to
be worth in a couple of years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, you know, what, what really is
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a septic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a this, it doesn't have a
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a spot on the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of these people that moved here
just had no idea how to like maintain a
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like these properties are just
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're leaving them with just,
broken down carports and shitty shacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw up real quick just to dry some
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, just garbage, tons of garbage,
you know, on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People leave a lot of garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then everyone thinks that like Mendo and
Humboldt is this beautiful, pristine
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of human garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends from Santa Cruz would come up
here and go, man, why does everybody like
[SPEAKER_00]: having garbage out in their front yards up
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: A natural repository for garbage yards
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo Fashion is having some sort of blue
tarp ripped up and you know, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's normal around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was places that we bought
that we went in and like they would take
[SPEAKER_01]: like an old barn or an abandoned cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would just fill it with their
household trash because they didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have trash service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have to put on like essentially
a hazmat suit and you rent most places we
[SPEAKER_01]: got ahold of in the late nineties through
the mid two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things you would do was
get however many 40 yard dumpsters you
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could load 40 yard dumpsters with
trash and some people would just make a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge pile and cover it with gas and set it
on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a big black fucking black,
nasty horrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would, you know, it was an
interesting spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's one million Whippet
containers and all that kind of shit later
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean in the Whippet containers in the in
the open blast era of butane, it got
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad up here and people would do
stuff where they got scared of throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: away thousands of empty cans of tain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would like use a back hoe and dig
a hole in the woods and just pour all the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in there and drive over it and then
fill it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, I mean, I've seen a lot of them
just left on the side of a road,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge piles, thousands and thousands of
butane canisters just left out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful wilderness with just a big
massive pile of butane cans laying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, so there's an aspect to
that where like that whole open blast era
[SPEAKER_01]: which was probably eight or eight or 10
years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of dumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of melted skin on humans
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some really bizarre stories of
humans melting as clandestine butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laughing, but it's true,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends that their skin looks
pebbled, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard about a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the end of the two hours we ran
all the way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, obviously we're just the
kind of dorks that could babble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we do anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the vibe we wanted to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it like to shoot a ship?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time I was on something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I didn't even realize I was just
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the good part is nobody can see
below your waist because he's absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we want to thank you for coming
on brother.

[SPEAKER_01]: He is one of my good homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chat a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit of a vibe into our
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even get to talk about how he
lost his sisters and essentially what
[SPEAKER_01]: brought him to the butt stuff world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of on unturned stones that
we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I didn't have to cry this whole
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He only cries after sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, yeah.
