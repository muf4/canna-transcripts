[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was like I was connected
with everything around me All of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_00]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me And I'm like wow I got high
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a got got good her skirt from up
north or cut upon it
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up everyone welcome to breeder
syndicate I'm Matt my co-host and friend
[SPEAKER_04]: not so that's me And we are here with pips
weed from souvenir seeds a very good
[SPEAKER_04]: friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been putting together for a long
Long like four years into making something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been wanting to do something and
Finally we're getting to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of our most requested shows so
I'm stoked to finally have you sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: here with this pip and Have you
interacting with me and not so and
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody can hear some insight into the
Ohio strains and what you're currently
[SPEAKER_04]: doing with your career So let's start at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start talking about one of the One
of the clones that held your interest the
[SPEAKER_04]: most when you first started growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was circulating at the time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean when I first started growing it was
just I had gotten random clones from a few
[SPEAKER_05]: different people They weren't really
anything special.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something orange really
low-yielding That's what I ran for my
[SPEAKER_05]: first several grows and it was kind of
depressing but it was better than nothing
[SPEAKER_05]: because I had a good smell and it was you
know decent smoke at least for me at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time, but the main ones You know,
I would say probably like when the lemon G
[SPEAKER_05]: and the death star came into my life was
like really when I saw like the full
[SPEAKER_05]: potential of like good quality cannabis
and And it's it really fascinated me so
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of like gave me the oomph to
take it to the next level and take things
[SPEAKER_05]: seriously and and I did and I you know
grew those for a long time for over a
[SPEAKER_04]: decade straight and How early into your
like smoking like from the age of where
[SPEAKER_04]: you started smoking to where you started
growing Like how long did it take until
[SPEAKER_04]: you started getting like death star
quality type weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, so when I first started smoking I
was probably around 13 and I was just get
[SPEAKER_05]: I got weed from this kid at school and he
stole it from his dad and sold it to me
[SPEAKER_05]: for You know $20.
[SPEAKER_05]: I paid him in rolls of quarters.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stole from my my parents closet or
something like that, you know And smoked
[SPEAKER_05]: it and I didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the first time I really ever
smoked weed I never really got a buzz and
[SPEAKER_05]: then Later on, you know, I would you know
High school came around, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had access to the swag basically the
seeded pressed Mexican stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's different varying levels of
that Some were actually surprisingly good
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that wasn't really compressed
and had the nice mature seeds in it a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of lime green stuff like that too,
we call it the Christmas trees,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there was good stuff as well,
but I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably my sophomore year of
high school is when I discovered what we
[SPEAKER_05]: called at the time kind bud Yeah KB and it
was in Akron at a college party and one of
[SPEAKER_05]: my smoking buddies and good friends I've
known for a long time came downstairs and
[SPEAKER_05]: showed me this I was out on the porch.
[SPEAKER_05]: He showed me this bud He's like look at
this KB row and I'm like, what the hell is
[SPEAKER_05]: KB like I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like it's weed And I said I looked at
it and smelled it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like you gotta be kidding me,
dude that's confusing going from
[SPEAKER_04]: compressed to seeing like Your first
actual right bud like well-grown manicured
[SPEAKER_04]: like you personally bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, so at that point I had already
been selling stuff for a while I did
[SPEAKER_05]: through high school and stuff just to make
extra money We you know, I didn't come
[SPEAKER_05]: from the wealthiest family in the world by
any means.
[SPEAKER_05]: So It's kind of in a You know growing up
situation was kind of every kid fend for
[SPEAKER_05]: himself after a certain point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I Did what I had to do to survive and
make money?
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's how That's what I did for a
while and then eventually, you know after
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean senior year I did I grew some
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew my first plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah outside my parents backyard way in
the back and I planted them late and they
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't gonna finish in time and I knew it
so I dug them out of the ground and Put
[SPEAKER_05]: them in pots and brought them inside and
put them in my closet to finish out like
[SPEAKER_05]: the last You know three weeks or whatever
they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I lined the whole closet with tin
foil black light black lights in there
[SPEAKER_05]: like you know what I mean Yeah,
totally and it was it was looking back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just hilarious but I was worried I
was gonna get caught my mom wasn't super
[SPEAKER_05]: mean but she would She would look my ass
probably I thought yeah used if she found
[SPEAKER_05]: them and I had harvested it eventually and
then like Months later, maybe a year
[SPEAKER_05]: later.
[SPEAKER_05]: She told me that while I was at school She
was watering it because it was about to
[SPEAKER_05]: die that whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never told me and My mom was a gardener
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up growing all kinds of flowers And
planting gardens at our house and other
[SPEAKER_05]: people's houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of like, you know We're I
got a little bit of a green thumb before
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole cannabis thing So I understood
how things work and yeah and you know how
[SPEAKER_05]: to water and how to feed and you know What
a healthy plant looks like and what a sick
[SPEAKER_05]: plant looks like and all that kinds of
stuff how to prune them And then I never
[SPEAKER_05]: heard that story about your mom that's
fine She's a sweet lady she's been put
[SPEAKER_04]: through hell over her life But mad I can't
even picture my grandma being like I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: just take care of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad Yeah, so I would say
what was it probably right after right
[SPEAKER_05]: after high school is really when I
started, you know growing pretty good and
[SPEAKER_05]: I you know, probably three four years
after that I I'd say 2005 six seven ish
[SPEAKER_05]: right around those years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started getting a lot of really good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved up to Akron and I Met a friend of
mine who is still a really good friend of
[SPEAKER_05]: mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know each other for a really long time
He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Jay and he shared a lot of
really nice clones with me he shared the
[SPEAKER_05]: above a kush He shared the lemon cheese
the Afghani mango the Death Star the sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel Those were like the main ones,
you know, we've had different things over
[SPEAKER_05]: the years and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very early at that Time to be
getting clones like that too for people
[SPEAKER_04]: listening that aren't aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually pretty early to be Having
access to stuff like that in in random
[SPEAKER_04]: circles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good connect I had the Indiana
bubble gum was around at that time One of
[SPEAKER_05]: the very first ones I ever got is one that
99.9 of the you know percent of the people
[SPEAKER_05]: listening aren't gonna know what it is
unless you're local, but it was called
[SPEAKER_05]: when knocking some people say who knocking
and It was pretty frequent early 2000s
[SPEAKER_05]: around this area being sold and a lot of
people around here remember it so that's
[SPEAKER_05]: one I've had in my collection,
you know since probably 2005 like It's a
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of like Jack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've done a lot of research it might
I don't know what it is I feel like it
[SPEAKER_05]: could be like J1 maybe or I don't know it
came from it was a big A lot of the big
[SPEAKER_05]: Asian crews around this area Ran that it
was a it was a big one And it was
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere but this was back in the day It
was for a short period of like a two or
[SPEAKER_05]: three years that I remember our group
getting it consistently Yeah, that was one
[SPEAKER_05]: of the first ones I got was that a TV
queen Yeah, it was it was pretty yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like it's it's tealeen But it's got
like that funkiness that fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but fun kind of like thing in it
That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a it's a beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beautiful plant I I don't it's
those kind of plants aren't my favorite to
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the turpentine stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah But I've had I keep it because I've
had it for so long and I do enjoy the
[SPEAKER_05]: aromas that come from those plants I do I
mean I enjoy the looking at them and
[SPEAKER_05]: growing them and seeing the different
colors and you know Yeah, so I keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: around and I throw it in the flower room
once every couple years and do a nice one
[SPEAKER_05]: of it And lots of friends or something,
you know But if you're a sativa person,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's You know, it's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just super nostalgic Yeah for if
you're from around here and you're around
[SPEAKER_04]: in those times So we have that we have the
when would you when not key We called it
[SPEAKER_05]: the knock the now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's easier the when knocky that
We didn't want to mess around with the
[SPEAKER_05]: pronunciation We just called it the knock
the not that wasn't like that was just our
[SPEAKER_05]: friend group.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't like everybody You know,
that was just us we referred to it as the
[SPEAKER_02]: knock so that's one of the really
interesting things about weed that I like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch is that how like especially it
seems much more So in America than other
[SPEAKER_02]: places Every crew is insistent on giving
all these different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get little nicknames and Then amongst
that little crew it becomes like just what
[SPEAKER_02]: it's known by you know and so these
different strains at different times can
[SPEAKER_02]: take on different lives and You only know
what your friend gives it to you as So
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like when you pass around
girlfriends, you know You can start off as
[SPEAKER_02]: that and then it turns into the knock and
then it turns into this and then you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and It's it's interesting because
sometimes you don't make those connections
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you know someone that knew it by
both names, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, okay, it can happen,
you know I mean we definitely have seen
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that like we think it's one thing
and we'll probably talk about that a
[SPEAKER_02]: little later But we think it's one thing
and then lo and behold it turns out to be
[SPEAKER_02]: another You know, we think we think it's
another and you know, I'm I'm originally
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Midwest to although I've been in
California a long time now and it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of interesting How the Midwest works in
the sense that it was much less like
[SPEAKER_02]: trendy it was basically like is as Pip was
saying it's like if you got something
[SPEAKER_02]: better than Mexican it was better than
Mexican and It wasn't there wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: competition for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the desire for something better than
Mexican was huge So any kind of kind bud
[SPEAKER_02]: you had went any kind of a we called it
dank, you know we used to call it nuggets
[SPEAKER_02]: and the reason why we called it nuggets is
because Only nuggets were uncompressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you had the shape of the
bud the nugget itself, you know And so it
[SPEAKER_02]: looked like nuggets where it's like most
other stuff was compressed that even if it
[SPEAKER_02]: was lightly compressed it still changed it
But if I can stop you so, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had some nice stuff every once in a
while You run around nice stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a lot of the homegrown stuff back then
was a little bit creamy a little bit moist
[SPEAKER_02]: still And then we have my town anything
better than Mexican was kind of Right,
[SPEAKER_02]: right same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it was messed up if it wasn't
dried the right way or cured the right way
[SPEAKER_02]: if it was preemie There wasn't competition
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was still more people that wanted it
than there was it So it just went
[SPEAKER_05]: Beasters, I mean Beezers was kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Mean it was kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you guys remember that that stuff
went for the same ticket went for 50 and 8
[SPEAKER_05]: You know some people try charging more I
mean if you had it if you knew a guy who
[SPEAKER_05]: knew a guy you get the $40 deal But you
know straight up It was 50 bucks an eighth
[SPEAKER_02]: when it first hit the funny thing about
about Beasters in Canada is like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really bad Beasters they sent to the parts
of America that they thought had no
[SPEAKER_02]: competition and Then the parts of America
they thought had a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: competition from outdoor or indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would send like a different grade
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on what part of the country
you're in Sometimes there was some stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that was actually pretty damn good For the
time and then there was some stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: you were like, ooh Now I will say our
Canadian watchers have wanted me to to say
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, they only sent their crap down
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah That we were first we sters
they're like just remember we had good
[SPEAKER_04]: shit We just didn't share with y'all we
could chat about we could chat about that
[SPEAKER_02]: later, too But Pip and I have had some
long combos about there's certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has that he even likes them sort of
fermented And you know and what I mean by
[SPEAKER_02]: that is that a lot of times Beasters
because that's When you think of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it wasn't cured that great It
was still had some moisture in it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd seal it in a freezer in a freeze in
freezer You know seal a meals and ship it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would get no air exchange for a
couple of weeks until somebody cracked it
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of that Beasters would ferment
and I remember having conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: Pip about that and he was like man,
you know, there's a couple strains that I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually do that intentionally to Because
I like the fermentation process which is
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like that African Cobb work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the fermentation stuff You know,
it seems to me like a lot of the gassier
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that I run.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does it really well like the death star
You know you cure that at a super high
[SPEAKER_05]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have in my notes somewhere I forget it's
like I put it keep it in like a buck five
[SPEAKER_05]: gallon bucket with the screw top lid for
75% humidity or something like that for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while and a look and and not a cold area
though You want that warm air to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like get that process going?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it takes a little bit longer
You keep it in a cold area, but it does
[SPEAKER_05]: good with with a lot of the gassy stuff
the death star death star s ones I did it
[SPEAKER_05]: with it was really good I think stardog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've done it with before lemon G
It is I love the lemon G when it's done
[SPEAKER_05]: like that when it's like slightly
fermented like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's uh, I like it fresh, too I like it
both ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you know, what's your
preference?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different, you know, just slightly
different, but the hash people know too
[SPEAKER_02]: like when we talk about fermentation if
they're unfamiliar with it a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: curing happens on the stem and if you trim
stuff up kind of quick and it still has
[SPEAKER_02]: some Moisture content going on and you
start to some people call it burping,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know all that that's basically like
light fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm If you're if you've got fully
trimmed work in a bag or in a in a five
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon bucket like he's talking about and
it's not ready to smoke yet You're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fermenting it in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm in my opinion at least yeah,
and you definitely got a burp it too You
[SPEAKER_05]: can't just throw a bunch of wet weed in a
bucket and no that's called molding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a fine line It takes you a while
to figure it out for each strain and like
[SPEAKER_05]: all that but in the time frame and all
that but you know I just keep it in room
[SPEAKER_05]: temp and and it's done pretty good versus
like in a colder area stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a that's a complex process
and I'd imagine a lot of failure On the
[SPEAKER_04]: way to figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honestly it was is by accident
really, you know In my earlier years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just you know left some stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it did the process by itself I did
I guess I just left it in a bag or I left
[SPEAKER_05]: it somewhere and I would notice every time
I did that that stuff that was a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit more moist and sat upstairs in a bag
after a couple months or whatever taste it
[SPEAKER_05]: was like it was a little bit darker like
it was like like degrading, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but and it wasn't as loud but it wasn't
like with the Death Star it was like sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: it like loses its gas a little bit and
becomes like sweet and And it's just I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, it's super smooth smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way smoother than like smoking a
fresh bud out off of a plant or something
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember smoke was super it's it was
thick smoke Yeah, I mean for a minute
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff super thick cloudy smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you looked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay I didn't know I got the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's uh, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy it It's not something I'm gonna
smoke all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, you know, it's like a fine wine
it's just it's cool smoking and getting
[SPEAKER_05]: that sweet flavor and like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you gotta you gotta try it to
understand it and that that's also
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's interesting I think too
about like the era we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: where information didn't exchange as fast
and a lot of times like when I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: like how I cure and stuff it was kind of
like you dry things and sometimes it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: well and sometimes it doesn't and then
sometimes you learn things good and bad by
[SPEAKER_02]: accident on how you treated it,
you know, and that's kind of what it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like, you know All you put it up
there you put it in a bag and all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden it did this thing you weren't
expecting and then you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, well, how did I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start playing with like what you
did to make it do that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, oh does it work with this other
strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: This strain doesn't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this strain boy, do I like what it
does when it does that and I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cool because you know,
a lot of times one of the cool things
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing in the Midwest is that
because change was slower back home people
[SPEAKER_02]: grew the same strains for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was there was less turnover where
like all of a sudden your customers are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, this is bunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need something new.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just stoked to have you get what
you what's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result of that, sometimes
Midwestern growers really got to dial in
[SPEAKER_02]: certain strains because they had a long
relationship of success by being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also we'll talk about that soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the some of the stuff that you
know that Pip has in his collection is
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty rare nationwide because there
wasn't pressure to move on to a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was various clones and
cuts getting passed around locally and
[SPEAKER_02]: they did well locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had their own they had a life of
their own almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where in California, you know,
populate, you know, popularity changes and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden everyone dumps something
and just moves on to the next new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were able to I mean, you were you were
telling us, you know, Death Star and Lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: G like were the better part of a seven,
eight year run for you in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: success.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I I ran them hard, hard for,
you know, at least eight years,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and then I kind of brought new
other strains in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still running Lemon G and Death
Star.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over that over that time, you know,
you know, especially with indoor where you
[SPEAKER_02]: get to do a number of rips a year,
you really get to learn how the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: likes to grow, how big to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It what size pots, how to feed all that
type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, really like you really get it's
like a long term relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really get to know your partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so right, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, it took me I'd say it
probably to fully master Lemon G
[SPEAKER_05]: consistently, especially on a bigger
scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, took me probably a solid four or
five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that was at the beginning of
when I started growing, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nowadays it's not as difficult,
but it's a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that you can throw in
with a bunch of other plants and expect it
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, do well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to kind of like give it its own
environment, its own everything like Lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: G doesn't like a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't like a lot of heat like
cannabis plants in general don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Lemon G, especially I raise my lights
up to do crops and it flourishes under,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 25 watts per square foot,
like really, really low lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's half of what suggests I believe
they suggest what 50 60 watts per square
[SPEAKER_05]: foot for generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and that's what I've been running for
most of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's I like that I get good quality
off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it keeps the heat down because I don't
have to have a bunch of lights packed in
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it keeps the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times when you know, you do two
hotter lights on the top foot foot and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half of your plant might look gorgeous,
but it might have some of the turps burned
[SPEAKER_02]: out by the intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like actually the bottoms tend to
smell and taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get away with less light.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of the plant brings out some of that
subtlety, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my area, we've always I should
mention we've always had low ceilings,
[SPEAKER_05]: the houses, low basement ceilings in the
houses around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've actually seen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was kind of a lot of people around
here use 600 waters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I've used pretty much
since I started.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used thousands before, but 90 percent
of what I've done is all been 600 watt
[SPEAKER_05]: lights.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Amsterdam had the same thing when I
first started going there, they were all
[SPEAKER_02]: foreign six hundreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought thousand watts were crazy
American stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that we're onto Lemon G,
let's talk a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics of Lemon G and the history of
Lemon G and the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon G, because that's really like,
I think, I mean, what most people find
[SPEAKER_04]: really exceptional about Lemon G is that
flavor, smell, all that goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first introduction to it was on the
forums, you know, there was there was some
[SPEAKER_04]: speculation about it being skunk misty
something, you know, there's some
[SPEAKER_04]: speculation G 13 hash plant, you know,
expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you found out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, there's you know, I've been
told a lot of things over the years I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been married to a lot of theories,
different theories over the years,
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple at least.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a lot of a lot of what you
read is not the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are close, you know,
but I was able to get the story from a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend of mine who worked for the lady who
made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to mention her name,
but she is local to the state that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and she told him that it was lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was I'm sorry, skunk misty crossed with
some G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the G 13 this this lady got as seeds
from I believe from a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think she ordered them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could G 13 skunk G 13 hash plant G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll show you how many G 13 crosses
was there, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's, you know, and this is a good
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my my my really good buddy who he
wouldn't bullshit me or anything like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what she says.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from her mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I guess what she's always said.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to kind of clear that up,
that's where the stories add on the lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: G as far as what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know exactly what year it was
made.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume it was probably somewhere
in like the early 2000s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of like what I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've never really gotten an exact date
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and the turf profile, how would you
best describe the flavor of G 13 or lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: G?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, lemon lemon G lemon G is very,
very, very lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not hardly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no, no turpentine or anything like
that, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you notice any Matt?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, because I can't pick it up if
there is any lemon lemon and lemon rind
[SPEAKER_04]: and lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it leans lemon astringent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it doesn't have a lot of
sweetness on the back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like a very pungent lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me stop you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you grow it like crap, it gets that
very it's that very like rindy,
[SPEAKER_05]: bitter, almost smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you if you grow that plant good,
it comes out like sweet sugar candy lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I'm telling you, there's it's a
finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people get rid of it because they
can't they can't get it to perform right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just get that like basic version of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Frank, like he was just talking
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, just get that basic version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and they have a hard time with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, it took me several years
faces as we both realize, oh, we only ever
[SPEAKER_04]: grew it like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I mean, I have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a thing with citrus where like,
you know, there's there's a range there
[SPEAKER_02]: from like spraying mouth like cleaner into
your mouth to like a little like I tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: like the sweet back end because it
balances the astringent, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those things where for me,
like I love citrus, but I have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: other things need other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have citrus be my only weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I describe lemon G,
I always tell people it's like a lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: came into a bean form, like a human form
and then pissed lemon into your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about how I can describe lemon G.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I it's it's very unique to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've I've seen a lot of plants and I was
lucky to get that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so lucky to get that plant earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that I can't believe it,
but it's so it's still to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that I've ever seen really
that smells like lemon G like lemon G does
[SPEAKER_05]: that didn't come from lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you pull lemon G out and you
give it to somebody that's never smelled
[SPEAKER_05]: it before, I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your eyes are lighting up like you're
like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it just blows you away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a good buzz indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's decent outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: That plant is magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the buzz of that stuff outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will only smoke lemon G if it's
grown outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so much better, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I grew it indoor most of my life and
it's still good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a it's a light buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: All my female customers over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the number one requested for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ladies absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps it gives them energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They clean on it, you know, and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's been it's been pretty,
you know, pretty popular with the females
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you have you tried lemon G?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you tried lemon tree or lemonade yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard lemon tree smells a lot like
lemon G, but I tend to think that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: related some way to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it has to be a lemon G.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say it has to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing I wanted to mention is my
buddy mentioned that he had smoked my same
[SPEAKER_05]: good buddy again.
[SPEAKER_05]: He smoked the G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a G 13 skunk back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said that's the closest thing he's
ever spelled to lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like very spot on, but it was just
kind of mild.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought that was a kind of
interesting, you know, thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I know a lot of people are going
to ask about what's the skunk Misty as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I haven't I I wish I could
tell you it's probably they had a strain
[SPEAKER_05]: called Misty back in the day, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nirvana or somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nirvana, Nirvana seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to be confused with people always
confuses Nirvana with gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I say, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no, Nirvana seeds had a Misty and I
can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: NL something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically everything in Amsterdam
then that wasn't from Neville or a few
[SPEAKER_02]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost everything was was something by
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so having something that was
Misty by skunk one in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the most common hybrid in
Amsterdam was something by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because skunk one was just consistent,
you know, and I actually can kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: that the G 13 straight cut that you had,
Pip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can kind of see skunk and G 13 in that
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, lemon G is kind of like it's kind
of got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is like people don't take
this the wrong way, but it kind of has
[SPEAKER_02]: that like ugliness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're like there was an era
where like we didn't have to be pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and lemon G definitely has kind
of that like G 13 like weird bud
[SPEAKER_02]: formation, leaf formation, especially
look, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from skunk one, some kind of citrus coming
through is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see, you know, it's probably the
skunk one probably took the G 13 from
[SPEAKER_02]: being leafy and a mess and made it gave it
that nice running cola that probably made
[SPEAKER_02]: it such a good cropper for you for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and yeah, I saw, you know,
the lemon G for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me start by saying, actually,
first, there's a G 13 clone that's gone
[SPEAKER_05]: around this area for a long time since I
was in school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, my parents, my friend's parents
grew it and my other friend's parents grew
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And eventually I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that thing is I thought for sure that
is what was used for lemon G because you
[SPEAKER_05]: can smell that in the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's obvious you could smell that
plant in the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, OK, these both came from the
same state.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're they smell related.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably related.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just always figured that's kind of
what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: But and I don't know what that it's with
that G 13 plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's an airborne G 13 cut
from the forums or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a short little stubby Afghan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's not really like it's nothing
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people prefer to smoke or grow
these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's more like your head
stash, unique, old school Afghan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any type of type of stuff like little
soapy, a little like it's been a while
[SPEAKER_05]: since I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I went through that whole
dudding scenario, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_05]: I it's just one I've never been able to
get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been looking around several times,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people have given you stuff back and
it turned out not to be it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think maybe once with the G,
but the G is pretty easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you get a clone of that and it
veggies up a little even a little bit,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you might even be able to tell
from clone like it's a really unique
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Short squat little Afghani, but we can
talk about that a little bit if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I used to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were looking, he would send me
pics and we would always kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: wonder is it like is it airborne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Pacific?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something more ancient than that
that like survived where he's at?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that like if you look at
some of the Neville's few pics that he put
[SPEAKER_02]: up of the classic G 13 clone, it kind of
had that like gnarly ancient Afghani ugly
[SPEAKER_02]: look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was very similar for lack for
lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's plenty of weed that I
think is kind of ugly that I actually love
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim 91, the ugliest plant ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the ugliest plant ever,
but on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there is definitely some haze that I
find that I find attractive that is way
[SPEAKER_02]: more hideous.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Kim 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're like, oh, this thing
doesn't have any crystal, doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's calyxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then yeah, I curse,
but we're in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're after a minute in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe so that we chatted about the
lemon G for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we chat about the other thing
you got early that you really love,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a great name and it's been
consistently one of your favorites
[SPEAKER_02]: basically from now to then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really hasn't shifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Death Star is my all star.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've loved that plant since the day I got
it, the day I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so happy the day I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I only had probably at that
point like 10 or 12 plants in my
[SPEAKER_05]: collection and it just completely kicked
them all out of the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I like that, that hardcore like
potency, like knock you down, put you into
[SPEAKER_05]: the couch type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and that's the effect you get off
the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you also get the super
crazy like oniony tennis ball,
[SPEAKER_05]: like rubber gas, like skunk, like
nastiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you grew a killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've had shitty Death Star,
like where it's grown to where there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: very much rubber at all, where it's more
of that oniony spicy backend and it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: not very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I've had your Death Star where it
just kicks its ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when he's describing this, if,
if it smells different than the way he's
[SPEAKER_04]: describing it, it's because he's grown it
very, very, very well for a very long
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead, continue, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the history of Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess where do I start?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll start at, uh, Team Death
Star, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're from Ohio, Columbus area,
and they are the people that created the
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Death Star is a cross of, uh,
Sensi Star and, um, Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, it was, it was an accidental
pollination, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they had a couple of seeds and
they sprouted them and they picked the
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those few seeds that they
sprouted was this amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I was so lucky, I was so lucky to
get it in the mid 2000s at the time when I
[SPEAKER_05]: had, you know, only been growing for four,
five years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just so intrigued by this plant
and how potent it was and how much yield
[SPEAKER_05]: it put out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just started putting it in all my
rooms basically that I had, that I had
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering and I just started growing it
and growing it and growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, I mean, there's people at my
door pitchfarts, you know, three weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: before harvest, like where's it?
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was, it was scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's just, it flew off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I enjoyed, I was smoking it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but yeah, so that came from,
uh, from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got, uh, the uh, the, uh,
the sour diesel cut they got, I think came
[SPEAKER_05]: from a fish show in Vermont back in like,
uh, I forget the date.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 2004, I think fish did like a
farewell show at a airport in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and they picked up, I don't know
if they picked it up in Vermont or if they
[SPEAKER_05]: picked it up back along the way from
Vermont to Ohio, but along that trip is
[SPEAKER_05]: when they acquired that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, from what I've heard of
another front of theirs, uh, went to
[SPEAKER_05]: Amsterdam and got seeds and came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I guess they were grown and a
selection was made and that was given to
[SPEAKER_05]: team death star by a friend of theirs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's how the cross got the
death star got made.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things maybe I should mention,
cause it's like a long-term running joke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it ties into what Matt and Pip were
just discussing is that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it takes probably a good 84 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, I mean, that's, that's
about, that's, that's what I push it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can pull it at 77 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of people would pull it at
70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where a lot of people make that's
the point I'm going to make is that one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons why it might be so
good from Pip versus other people is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he was willing to actually see
like how long does this thing need to go
[SPEAKER_02]: before it hits perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens like, and this used to
happen with sour diesel a lot in
[SPEAKER_02]: California is that there's people that
would grow it until it hit the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people that would grow it
until it hit good enough for market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a vast difference that like,
say you might be able to cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was just saying, if you cut death
star at 70, it might fly out the door,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not be as nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pip would take it an extra two weeks
and it would reach this extra level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the same thing would happen
with sour out West.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would happen with some other cuts where
it was like, there was croppers where
[SPEAKER_02]: like, as soon as it had the nose and was
growing, good enough to go, it's time to
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of people that don't
like taking anything over nine or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, you know, and sometimes not with
everything, sometimes you go downhill,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with some things, if you give it that
extra week or two, it makes a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it lets the potency and the
flavor and some of the depth come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I think when Matt was
talking about all this death star sucks,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was probably a lot of death star
that was cut at 10 that needed to go 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there was a lot cut at seven that
needed to go 12 too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The earlier you cut it, you know,
the less nuance and depth it'll have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing else I wanted to add too is when
this accidental cross happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it actually pollinated some
other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the Indiana bubble gum,
which was a clone I had at this time as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was popular around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had the dumpster, which is a
popular one from, you know, back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: day around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think those were both pollinated
because when I was at, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the festival Nelson ledges in,
you know, the mid 2000s, I was seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: these strains called bubble star and dump
star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was maybe one or two more
that I can't recall right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I definitely remember seeing a lot of
the bubble star.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the death star was a little bit
difficult to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the sensei star was a little
bit difficult to get as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was just like lots of it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like, you mentioned dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ohioans are going to want to hear about
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you rep Ohio's dumpster for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is dumpster?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it smell like a dumpster?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it really found in a dumpster?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the story, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's, I hadn't heard it from the
horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of things over the year
and it's, it's all generally lines up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, things get left out over the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things get added, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: So take it, whatever I say as is,
but supposedly it was, uh, there was a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of guys growing together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, one of them is known as the professor
and I was told that they basically had a
[SPEAKER_05]: falling out and they were, they were
growing this plant and then they had a
[SPEAKER_05]: falling out and they threw this whole room
away into a trap.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one guy threw the whole room away into
a trash can or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other guy went back and got
the cut that they were growing out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: dumpster and called it dumpster.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that's, that's just what I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's more details.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I do have some connections.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can get more details on that from,
but, uh, you know, I think, what did I,
[SPEAKER_05]: what did I say?
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of, it kind of reminds me of like
the, there's a garlic bud pick and you
[SPEAKER_05]: ever seen that, the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: 1989.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the seed bank, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of, it kind of reminds me a lot of
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, it's, it's almost dead on
that leaf and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks, you know, just like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so I've heard people say it's,
you know, Shiva skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, there was a lot of that sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I mean, definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the other interesting part just
real quick before we get up on that
[SPEAKER_02]: tangent is that at the seed bank,
Neville called this line garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it, and then when sensei
seeds sold the same line, when they bought
[SPEAKER_02]: his company, they called it Shiva Shanti.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so there could be some truth to
both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could, it, you know, PIP and I have
chatted about, it does very much look like
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of an old NL skunk type hybrid of
some kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the turf profile?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I classify it as like, it's like a,
a sweet pineapple with like that toe jam
[SPEAKER_05]: funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a funk in it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, uh, that's kind of, that's kind
of like where I lie with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, uh, it's good smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, I mean, to be honest,
it's just average smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a commercial, just typical,
like a commercial type variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people did a lot of grows of
dumpster in Ohio over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because it yields like crazy,
but, um, it does get big buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit prone to mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to watch out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but overall it's, I mean, it's a
staple in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been around for 20 years or whatever
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a, there was a fake one that
went around Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Jason mentioned it in his books.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called chumpster CA with a C H
chumpster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I personally never saw that one,
but I just figured I would mention it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and it was mostly run in Toledo back
in the day, I believe at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, we're like the
professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I've also heard people say that there
was a guy in Columbus, uh, and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where this whole situation happened as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just not a hundred percent sure,
but that's kind of where I'm at with the
[SPEAKER_05]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the, um, Afghani mango?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's another older classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Afghani mango.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I got that around again, around mid
two thousands, uh, from my buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was one of his favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember going over to his house one
day, he was living up in Akron and I walk
[SPEAKER_05]: in and I smell this smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, man, that smells, I mean,
that is really unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I'm smoking Afghan mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was smoking it out of his volcano
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me some puffs and I smoked it and
the flavor was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like this like soft mango,
a little bit of a sweet for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of like metallic smell in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just super interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he, you know, brought me upstairs
and showed me like two or three lights and
[SPEAKER_05]: upstairs bedroom, a little window AC or
something and a fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had, uh, he had it growing up there
and it was just such a unique looking
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'd really never seen anything
like it up until this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was growing a lot of like kind of more
like Indica dominant stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the Afghani mango is definitely a
little bit more sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes these long spheres that kind of
like aren't thick, but they fill in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like long spheres.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and I ran it for ran it for quite
a while, but it could be finicky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it does this weird thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll stunt out sometimes, uh,
like kind of like fail to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then it also, if, if the
conditions aren't perfect, it can tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: like herm a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like if one plant in the room is like
by the fan constantly getting beat up the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole time, like it could herm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never really did large runs of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a commercial Ohio strain for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of people have done big, big runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Afghan mango and pass it around the
state over the years and stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's just, uh, it's a super unique
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've, you know, I've, I've seen,
um, angels breath and I think I've told
[SPEAKER_05]: you before, Matt, by Mr. Nice and angel
heart and that, and it kind of looks very
[SPEAKER_05]: similar to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I know you've mentioned to me
that those are relatively recent releases
[SPEAKER_05]: within the past 10, 11 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I've had the Afghan mango for,
you know, for longer than that,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that would, you know,
that would kind of nullify it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't know a hundred percent super
unique plants been around Ohio for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: KC 33, maybe always an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Casey mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the Casey brain stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's older.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it was, it was grown a lot
because it was one of the more affordable
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, but there was great, great stuff in
it, like amazing stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of breeders ended up knocking it off
later on to, uh, BCs BC mango is based on
[SPEAKER_04]: that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to take a look into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be another direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I've talked to a lot of people,
you know, a lot of local people,
[SPEAKER_05]: people in the wheat game over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always ask about Afghan mango
because it's one of the ones that I have
[SPEAKER_05]: the least information about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they made it, if they
bought seeds of it from a company,
[SPEAKER_05]: when it came around, um, it was
definitely, you know, early to mid two
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands areas where I would put it,
put that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to ask Conza.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where he sourced his seeds, see if he has
any kind of anything on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever talked to him about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask him.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go from the, the, the, the,
the, we haven't done four way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't believe we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hit four way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, uh, the four way I had, um,
I had originally gotten a plant back in
[SPEAKER_05]: who I don't know the exact date,
2014, 15, 16, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I had gotten a plant from a friend of
a friend and it was called a sensei star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew it and I realized I had smoked
this before, you know, but I couldn't,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't tell, you know, like,
is this a sensei star I smoked or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so, so I had grown it for years
and I had liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, after growing it a couple of times,
I really noticed a lot of similarities to
[SPEAKER_05]: the death star because I've been growing
death star for ever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it kind of has that like little
zigzag, uh, structure it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the aromas in it as well,
kind of, uh, kind of are very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I actually thought for a
long time that it actually was the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that was used, uh, to make the star pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, recently I found, you know,
I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, death, death star, I've grown death
star S ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've definitely seen the S one progeny and
it's pretty, pretty clear now that they
[SPEAKER_05]: are, uh, you know, sensei star dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so, um, I feel like it's related.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the four way my cut would,
you know, is related somehow, whether it's
[SPEAKER_05]: part of sensei star or a component of it
was used to make sensei star or something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so that's kind of like, that's kind of
where I, where I'm at now with,
[SPEAKER_05]: with that, I grew that sensei star for
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually, uh, along the way I
had gotten plants under different names,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, such as it's, it's, they were the same
plant as my sensei star.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it under the name of death star from
some people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it under the name of four way from
the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it under the name of, you know,
all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time over the years,
I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Oh my gosh, it's the same plan
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like why is it the one that you kept
getting back is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, fast forward several years
after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of years ago, I, uh, I was
looking, I reached out to a friend of her,
[SPEAKER_05]: of a friend who had a friend, um,
who said that they had the Ohio four way
[SPEAKER_05]: clone that used to go around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I, uh, I get in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go over to his house and he's a super
cool guy, a little bit older and he shows
[SPEAKER_05]: me a jar of the flower and, and I kind of
like, you know, saw the resemblance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, almost like this is that same
plan again, but I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he took me downstairs into his
little hut and he had like a light with
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, three or four plants and
they weren't in the best shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some thrips on them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but it just wasn't the best
representation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't a hundred percent sure yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, so anyway, he, you know,
he gave me the cut and I brought him some
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff too, because he's from a small
circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't have access to a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gave him some cool stuff to grow and
I went and, you know, grew this thing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were talking and smoking his
flower, when I met up with him,
[SPEAKER_05]: he told me that he's had it for 20 years
and that one of his buddies was a guy that
[SPEAKER_05]: bought the seeds and made the selection
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he originally said, uh, you know,
the guy that I met, uh, that I got the cut
[SPEAKER_05]: from said that it was from Sensi seeds,
but I had him actually contact his buddy,
[SPEAKER_05]: the guy who got him and he confirmed that
he said he got them from Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, you know, Nirvana's description is
slightly different from Sensi seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, they did a lot of work with
other people's lines back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't be surprising to me if it
was more than likely just Sensi's work
[SPEAKER_05]: that they were using.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the most, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and Nirvana was probably,
I probably would have bought Nirvana's
[SPEAKER_04]: over Sensi's during, you know,
during those early era, that early era,
[SPEAKER_04]: because Nirvana's was always like $90,
whereas Sensi's was like 240, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nirvana verifiably took various lines from
Sensi, um, and repro'd them and gave them
[SPEAKER_02]: their own names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they famously took Neville's NL2
and called it Oasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was, it was very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one thing we probably should
mention about the, about the Sensi star
[SPEAKER_02]: itself is that even though it came out in
1995, uh, we still don't know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: heck it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's been extremely, uh,
reluctant to mention any parentage,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, as far as, uh, the guy who owns
Paradise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what else I found interesting
was in 95 Sensi Seeds, um, re-released the
[SPEAKER_05]: four-way, uh, I don't know what they mean
by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but in 1995 they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a year after in 96, I believe was
when Paradise started and released the
[SPEAKER_05]: Sensi star, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what was actually released.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty, pretty close together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, can't prove anything, but you
know, it's just, uh, like I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's possible that, uh, that four-way was
used or that one of the components that
[SPEAKER_05]: make up four-way was possibly used,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's coming through expressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was, was Afghan tea and four-way?
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a long time for us to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was one of those things that
was hiding in plain sight where,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Neville wrote in his 87 update to his
catalog that he was about to release this
[SPEAKER_02]: strange thing called four-way and it was
Big Bud NL one by early Pearl skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and so it was, it was another one
of those things that like Pip and I and
[SPEAKER_02]: others, we hunted and hunted and hunted
forever, looking for any information on
[SPEAKER_02]: what would actually the makeup was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then it was one of those things
that was just like hiding in plain sight
[SPEAKER_02]: if you knew where to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so it was honestly one of those,
like the nineties was a lot of F ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that was an early poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, because I believe,
uh, I believe Neville released both of
[SPEAKER_02]: those plants that made up four-way as
separate strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Bud NL one just became the big bud
line and early Pearl skunk one,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe got released as early skunk,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was already lines he was playing
with separately to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he took two of them and combine
them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so obviously as a four-way hybrid,
um, it could lean in different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and especially amongst the progeny and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I wanted to clarify, uh,
today, if you go on their website,
[SPEAKER_05]: since he sees labels it as Indian by
Afghanistan, by Pakistan, by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't know when this was
released.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in any of their nineties
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but they did use in 1987, Neville did
the Senate update for his eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: 87 catalog, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he was going to, you know,
have a four-way hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next year he comes out with four and
more and that's the only year it comes
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two years go by 89 and 90 and
it's not in the catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 91, since he sees comes along
and releases four-way and they use the
[SPEAKER_05]: same exact description that Neville used
for his four and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same, same finish time, same
verbiage in the description to all that
[SPEAKER_02]: type, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clues like that, you know, um,
and, you know, I mean, we don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, there's, there's some
other famous cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Fairfax four-way that
supposedly was from the same line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, obviously like if you
get a four-way hybrid, um, it could lean
[SPEAKER_02]: in a number of different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one thing I wanted to pull on
real quick, because I wasn't clear on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about the,
the, the, the bubble star and some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, um, was that made with death star
pollen or was that made with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen from maybe like the East coast,
sour diesel that threw on some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the sensei star that threw it was
the sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sensei star was the, was the,
the dad, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensei, the sensei star through the
sensei star through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that's where bubble star
and some of those other hybrids you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about that you would see floating
around came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, it definitely came.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it definitely came from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same accidental pollination or I don't say
accidental.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that they saw that the sensei
star was kind of making pollen and they
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of used it and sprinkled it is what
I've heard as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what happened, but, um,
but yeah, I believe it was made early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminized seed used to be like,
you know, uh, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant gets stressed, accidental pollen
flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you have some
feminized bag seed long before we figured
[SPEAKER_02]: out STS or any of these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other methods that moderate where you're
using in modern times, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Matt's smiling over there or
whatever, but, uh, but yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for old people like me,
we used to think that that accidental
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination, like if you use that,
you were cheating and it would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: ruin the line because it was made not the
natural way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big belief back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Oh, you're going to use some
herm accident stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to probably like imprint that
into your seed line and you'll never get
[SPEAKER_02]: it out and it'll be worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that just goes to show how ignorant
we were at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were convinced that, you know,
the other day Caleb made a post and it
[SPEAKER_04]: drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nuts when I see this,
but it's the typical, what I call the
[SPEAKER_04]: typical hippie response to like a
feminized seed post is like, ha,
[SPEAKER_04]: see, like it was, it was CSI posting about
a reversal failure, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, huh, it's cause,
cause you were, you were messing with
[SPEAKER_04]: nature is what happened there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had to point out, you know,
the nature, once these plants intersects,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's because man's intervened that they're
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, actually, if you really want
to get technical, they're taking it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like this really bad logical
argument that they seem to have in their
[SPEAKER_04]: heads that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herming is us being bad with plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd used to be very bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: There used to be, there used to be a lot
of bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is just stuff that
gets passed around and smoking circles and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I've talked about it on
previous shows where we used to put our
[SPEAKER_02]: best Mexican, but in the resin chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would gain quality, you know,
you put that nice Mexican, but in your
[SPEAKER_02]: resin chamber and you don't smoke that one
until the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you pull that out and you thought
that was an improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of misinformation in
the nineties and early two thousands when
[SPEAKER_02]: the internet and, and sort of like,
you know, facts, it was basically just a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of kids spreading what they heard
from older people, maybe are reading in
[SPEAKER_02]: high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we used to think high times was
sort of the Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get older and you're like,
Oh man, who takes that advice?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a real era in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, yeah, so I mean,
four way, you know, it, it ended up being
[SPEAKER_02]: one of your favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, it's just, you know,
super unique, super old school.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell if you've been growing,
growing a lot of plants, you can grow it
[SPEAKER_05]: and look at it and be like, yeah,
that's definitely not from around this
[SPEAKER_05]: time period.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, definitely some like nineties
weed, something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really growing or smoking in the
eighties, so I didn't see a lot of that
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, but I've seen enough stuff from,
you know, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: To know when something's a little bit
older and, you know, different than
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say that the, the four way,
the Ohio four way is skunky at all?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the Fairfax four way, like the one
time when I got to, cause it was super
[SPEAKER_04]: dutted when I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one time I got to like get any
hint of smell out of it, you could smell
[SPEAKER_04]: like what direction it was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, Oh wow, this does have
potential to be as skunky as they've
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cut does it's the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the four way that I have is it's not
as skunky as like the death star.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it doesn't, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's, it's milder than the death star,
but it's got more like other stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like that, like,
I don't know how to, that old world likes
[SPEAKER_05]: those old world smells, you know,
like kind of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashy spicy, uh, you know, skunky stuff
going on in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The w the other one was like, um,
had oniony in it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the other smell I could really
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some stuff about that four
way, certain things about it that remind
[SPEAKER_04]: me of stuff you'd see from Afghan tea
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always found that interesting based
on what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really see Afghan tea in it unless
Afghan teas and spunk one or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, which is something that I'd
always like to dig further into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it, it, uh, it was, it was,
it was one of those confusing things for a
[SPEAKER_02]: really long time because Neville was one
of the only guys that just sort of laid
[SPEAKER_02]: out what was in his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that second wave of breeders pretty
much intentionally obscured, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, which were like his people like
us who are a little younger, younger than
[SPEAKER_02]: that and historians trying to figure out
what they used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, even 25, 30 years later, some of those
people don't want to just come off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what would it, what would it matter
if Luke came out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and said, this is what I used to make
sensi star in 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like big secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, can't let that out, you know,
like, and, but to this day, it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like, eh, what's it, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as of this year, as recent as
this year, he will not say, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have him on to talk about it,
but yeah, we've been getting declined.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's been around Robin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's one of those things
where for a lot of people, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it doesn't benefit me, why would I say
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, do I want to say that I
like ripped it off from Neville or I got
[SPEAKER_02]: it from this other person that I never
gave credit to or whatever the story may
[SPEAKER_02]: or may not be, they'd prefer it to remain
a mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not like anyone's going to go
and like find the parents 25 years later,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years later and like recreate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that ship is sailed.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're in this territory,
let's hit my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, the, the bud that made me fall
in love with Pips grows the silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did she come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: The silver Pearl came from a local guy
that actually got ahold of me on IG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I met him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a mutual friend as well at
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I'm not going to say either of
their names, but that's, that's who I
[SPEAKER_05]: received it from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Preface this saying like our group has had
this clone for a long time back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never grew it because I was so busy
tied up with lemon G and death star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was my show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my MO.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I didn't have time for anything
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already had 10 or 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was more than enough for me being a
cropper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of always passed on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would smoke it, you know, my friends
would have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd bring it over and they'd bring it
to our little, you know, cannabis cups
[SPEAKER_05]: that we had and stuff back in the day up
here in Akron.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I never really grew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as we got older, you know how
things go, stuff gets lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in the circle anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I wanted to give it a riff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I was able to get in touch
with this guy and he, he had gotten it
[SPEAKER_05]: from an older gentleman who lived down
Southern Ohio, I believe, and had it for
[SPEAKER_05]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I eventually acquired
it from him, you know, gave him some
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, seeds and I forget what else,
but it was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a funny story is like, a week later I
got another plant that I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking for that G13 you were
talking about earlier and someone gave it
[SPEAKER_05]: to me and I grew it up and I knew before I
even flowered it, it was Silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got Silver Pearl twice in the same
week from, or basically from different
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I'll say that's interesting
about that cut is that, and not everything
[SPEAKER_02]: does this, but that cut grown out looks
amazingly like some of the oldest pictures
[SPEAKER_02]: of Silver Pearl that you can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, you don't want to use
the word dead ringer too much or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, but boy, visually does it look
like it's, it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just walked out of the catalog and into
your collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like if you were to look at,
at HIP's Silver Pearl cut, and you were to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at some of those old pictures of
Silver Pearl, and you didn't know which
[SPEAKER_02]: was which, you'd have a hard time telling
the difference in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really looks, it really, it really does
resemble so that's not proof or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, but it certainly helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Silver Pearl is just such a
special plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a narcotic hitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, I prefer, I respect all cannabis,
regardless of whether I enjoy it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I gave it all a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy all the different aspects of it,
even if I'm not smoking it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but the Silver Pearl really grew on
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first smoked it, I was kind of,
I don't know, off put by it because I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted something you know, hard hitting,
but after, after smoking it for a while
[SPEAKER_05]: and giving it a chance and seeing what
it's really about, you know, smoking it
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh when you wake up in the morning,
you know, nothing in your system.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really just really uplifting,
motivating, happy, you know, bright buzz
[SPEAKER_05]: on a, you know, it's, it's very more of
like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like what you think of like a
sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But on a plant that's short and squat and
finishes in, you know, 50 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I call the high electric maybe
not, not in the sense that it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: giving you a rush, but it's bright and
happy to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very bright and happy is the best way I
can describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, and the scent profile,
like me and not so describe it completely
[SPEAKER_04]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and it's really just two different
takes on it, but it's because of how
[SPEAKER_04]: complex it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I have a description.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote of it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to remember some, but the basic
smells are, it's, it's like a,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of like a sweet melon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little bit of baby poo in
there, like that funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the, like the funky funk foot
funk, I guess a little bit type thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got some like anise, like almost like
a black licorice type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so those are kind of not so loves the
anise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like, yeah, I see for me, when I smell
it, I smell like pink bubblegum is the
[SPEAKER_04]: first smell I smell and D just grew it
outdoor and I smelled it and I smelled it
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first smell I smell is pink
bubblegum, but then there's like funky
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk background, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, yeah, it's got so much going
on, Matt, that confuses a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have a hard time really
like nailing it because there's just so
[SPEAKER_05]: much, there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like some of these, there's just
so many different, I mean, you can sit
[SPEAKER_05]: there and smell it for 10 minutes straight
and pick out all the different,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just really, really unique,
really awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, short flowering indica,
like I said, 50 days, not the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: yielder in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to defoliate it a little bit,
you know, like if he throws fan leaves
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere, big fat indica and,
but it's got a great, yeah, got a great
[SPEAKER_05]: structure and you don't even have to,
I don't think I've ever netted or staked a
[SPEAKER_05]: silver pearl plant in my life,
regardless of how big it's been.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I grew up into like five gallons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go bigger than that, but you know,
they support themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you don't even have to mess with them
at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's interesting about
it is that, because Pip mentioned it,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that when he says baby poo,
I also get a strong baby poo smell off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to clarify, like it smells to me
like infant baby poo, like when all
[SPEAKER_02]: they're on is mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they haven't gotten any kind of real
food, like because I have a number of kids
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, I'm familiar with that
era, but there's a very different smell to
[SPEAKER_02]: baby poo when they're one, two,
three, four months old, whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all they're eating is mommy's milk,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when they get actual real food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't smell like some kind of like
gnarly kid poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like this weird, it's almost
like one of those things to me where like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it wasn't in cannabis, you would
guarantee say it doesn't smell good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's like smells in cannabis that
smell weird, but you like them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of caught that's skunky,
sweet, sickly baby poo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't sound, maybe that doesn't
sound too appetizing, but it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think it's a beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is in the progeny, there is a little
bit of mint and I could smell a slight
[SPEAKER_05]: hint of it in the mom, but I got some
nice, nice selections I made that are like
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely like super minty, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a, it really, you know,
threw me off guard, surprised me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think it smells like a little bit,
some of them like a, like a Melanie,
[SPEAKER_05]: a melon kind of, you know, it's just,
I mean, it's got a lot going on,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what silver Pearl is supposed to be
according to Neville is NL five,
[SPEAKER_02]: a female, the famous clone crossed with a
early Pearl skunk one male, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things since we were just
talking about Four Way, I don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many different males
Neville decided to use of early Pearl
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk one, but it's somewhat possible that
it could have the same dad as Four Way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anything's possible, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because it's like, it's the same
mix from the same guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, the dad is early Pearl
skunk one in both hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a different male, but it's
definitely the same line.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that early Pearl is a early
girl crossed with Pollyanna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, that's, you know, that's what,
you know, they used to cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was the NL five and he had an
NL five skunk one male.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it written down like that because I
wasn't able to find exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a string base coming out
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the NL five by, by early Pearl skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's a three way hybrid,
a silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's interesting is since Matt and I
have been kind of doing a deep dive on
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the early girl, early Pearl stuff
is you don't really realize it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but secretly it was one of the most common
things Neville used throughout his lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved that early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved, he loved mixing it into
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it doesn't really get talked
about that much, but it was one of his
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where did the early girl come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California, Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pollyanna was, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: We just recently found out, um,
that one of them, one of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if it's early girl or
Pollyanna.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Pollyanna.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was early girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is not from Rob or Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always thought both were from Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the, there's a lot of
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early girl, I believe is a,
is an Afghan Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they took that and they crossed
that to Pollyanna, which is an early
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian by Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we also learned that that
sweetness, uh, is very, was very prevalent
[SPEAKER_02]: in the early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of Neville's favorite
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to recreate it really badly
later in his life because he enjoyed,
[SPEAKER_02]: he really enjoyed sort of that double
Mexican Afghan blend that was early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it showed up in so many
different hybrids he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And later in life, later in life,
he was working a specific Oaxacan line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember where he sourced it from
specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was later, but, um, he felt that that
was very similar to what he saw in the
[SPEAKER_04]: early Pearl, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, there's a, there's a
gentleman that, that Matt and I chat with
[SPEAKER_02]: on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he, his family, his family used to
grow early Pearl in the nineties for about
[SPEAKER_02]: five years, uh, up in my neck of the
woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been kind of on the hunt to find
he got lost in a bus sadly, but he did
[SPEAKER_02]: say, he, he sent me not knowing that we're
buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me this pic you had posted a
number of years ago of an early,
[SPEAKER_02]: of a silver Pearl S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, man, does this look like my
parents plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, uh, take that for what it's
worth, but he goes, but there was a,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, he showed me this picture and it's
from you, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, this one really looks like
my parents old cut of early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty
unique plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you've been around it and you've seen
some progeny, you could kind of tell,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, you know, what's related, if it's
related or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no doubt that, you know,
that's what he has.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had, and he thought that mine looked
like is, and it's also one of the rare
[SPEAKER_02]: things that PIP doesn't take 84 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't take 84 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of my plants are even halfway done
flowering 55 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I mean, you could pull it
before 50 if you wanted to, it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, it's, it's so quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I throw it in the flower room
and feed it for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, so it's like,
it's basically like a true seven weaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some of them go into the fifties,
you know, 55 days or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: but some of the progeny was done in 46,
47 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could probably pull it 45.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you lived in 1990, like they always,
like, you know, you see these seed
[SPEAKER_05]: descriptions and flowering times and
you're like, Oh, it's done in,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 60 days and really freedom.
[SPEAKER_04]: 35, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was the flowering time on super
skunk 49, 49, you know, just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: started on indoor and seeing those 50 day
strains and being like, I could get eight
[SPEAKER_02]: crops a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super enticing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just thinking, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I didn't realize that it was a bit,
it was a bit of marketing back then
[SPEAKER_02]: claiming everything took six or seven
weeks, but, um, you know, and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: realized how rare it was to find something
that developed that quickly that I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually liked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, so we got through, uh,
the ode to Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to Q Q 36.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Q 36.
[SPEAKER_05]: Q 36 is a wild one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, again, I don't have an exact date,
but it's somewhere like 2010, 11 ish 2009
[SPEAKER_05]: to 2011 somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so it's relatively kind of like new
kid on the block out here, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: for Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, uh, when I first got it,
it was in like 20, 20, 13, 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to look, but it, uh, it,
when I first got that thing, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking at the leaves on the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like it was like came out of the
Jurassic period or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: dinosaurs walking around something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, super weird, uh, super dark
Afghani, like super unique leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, so I've, you know, veg it up and
I flowered it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's definitely, I could tell
immediately it was definitely related to
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba, but it's not like anything that
I've seen crossed with Bubba before.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, they say the lineage is it's
basically Bubba Kush crossed with Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_05]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some, there was some work
done, um, in that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they had bred that line together,
uh, a second time they have twos or the BX
[SPEAKER_05]: twos or whatever they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they had a plant called the nuke that
went around for a while and it was decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but eventually that kind of got thrown
to the side once they used the nuke to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the next generation that,
you know, the Q36 came from ultimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that thing just blew everything out of
the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that nuke, everybody kind of like threw
that to the wayside and just focused on
[SPEAKER_05]: the Q36.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a Bubba, like a Bubba Kush,
but it's like cream, like super creamy
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't, it doesn't have like typical
Bubba leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got these short little like,
like, uh, almost like, uh, like clover or
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're very, they're just very
unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have pictures on my Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to look, um, the, the resin it
puts, it just pumps out resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I mean, almost looks like a,
like a, like one of these hype strains
[SPEAKER_05]: that you see now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so caked up in resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the smaller plants don't tend to yield
too well, but when I put them in like
[SPEAKER_05]: three or gallons or five gallons and got
them nice and veged up, they do pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: good yielding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like creamy Bubba and anise like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, again, like a black licorice type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like thing in there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, uh, it's a low, it's a low
tester.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tests it like 15%.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my buddies, some people have had
it tested a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_05]: but generally test below 20%.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is very, just like Bubba,
very medical, very good, good effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely smokes like it's over 20%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the flavor is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, creamy Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like if you're a Bubba lover,
like this one is the, this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like creamo Bubba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pip has shared it in our little tight
circle of friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say almost universally,
um, everyone regards it almost as an
[SPEAKER_02]: improved Bubba.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like better, maybe even,
maybe even better than Bubba would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like everything they like
about Bubba and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I would say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and more and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't hit it right, it doesn't
really turn out well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't yield well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit leafy and it can come
out a little bit like soapy sometimes I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, this plant, there's none of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't, I mean, even if you run it bad,
it's not coming out soapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not coming out crappy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's still going to do good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely like an improvement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't call it above like a
Bubba cut, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, uh, it's definitely like a newer
age version of like Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Improved, improved version of the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only reason why I say that is
because most people that really love to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow Bubba for their head end up growing
Q36 for their head and being totally happy
[SPEAKER_02]: with that plant and not having to grow
Bubba for their head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they get everything they like about
Bubba and a little bit more from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty high praise really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to clarify, a lot of people get
confused.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, uh, the Illudium is the Illudium Q36.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Illudium Q36 space modulator.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the gun that Marvin the Martian used
to use on the cartoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the full name is, you know,
Illudium Q36 space modulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a weird breeding trait that I
had where something about seed making,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it makes seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to seed the thing numerous
times and the same thing happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get, you know, 20 maybe if I'm lucky,
30, 40 seeds out of each pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, 30% of them are premature fully like
big seeds, but just white and hollow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and then the other ones,
some are mutated and then you sprout what
[SPEAKER_05]: you have left from that, you know,
whatever 10 or 12 seeds you get out of
[SPEAKER_05]: that 15 maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you sprout them and then some are,
are, are, uh, like mutant, like super
[SPEAKER_05]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like maybe 25, 30% of them from
what I've seen have been like mutant or
[SPEAKER_05]: run T or slow, you know, and then,
uh, a small percentage of them though,
[SPEAKER_05]: are, are really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been, it's, it's a lot,
it's, it's a tough pill to swallow when
[SPEAKER_05]: you try to pollinate a plant and you got
to rip apart a pound of weed to get,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 10 or 15 seeds that you can
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then only a quarter of those are going
to be something decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And only a percentage of those are going
to be something amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you were done, slicing and
dicing how much came out, I was thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: to myself, so he gets five seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes, I did cross it to the silver
Pearl and I grew those seeds and I did
[SPEAKER_05]: find an awesome selection, a really,
really awesome selection and kind of made
[SPEAKER_05]: it worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've posted it on my Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it makes seeds extremely resinous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it's extremely resinous,
uh, maybe even more so than the Q 36.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just absolutely caked on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get that picture over to you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I, I, I made two selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're both very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is just super unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of has the, um, I like that,
that like black licorice, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: like anise or I don't know how you
pronounce it, but I like that and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like it in the Q 36 and the,
so the, so one of the selection,
[SPEAKER_05]: selections I made has, it's kind of like a
lot of that and less of like the other
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like focused in onto it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not like the most ideal plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a huge yielder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of wiry, but it's got good flour
and it's got that flavor and that smell
[SPEAKER_05]: and that taste that I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I keep it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a lot of people understand
that too, when it comes to reversals,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, is that, uh, because there's other
things you've done too, like with your
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast, sour diesel cut, reversing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where like it works, but it doesn't really
give you enough seed that you can like
[SPEAKER_02]: even share it with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like you, it, it gives you 15
or 30 or 40 seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't even make, yeah, you can't
make packs of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like even difficult to share with
homies because you get so few and it took
[SPEAKER_02]: so much effort to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's just certain varieties out
there that for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, don't reverse well or don't take
seed, don't take pollination well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it makes it really hard to make
hybrids with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, speaking of hybrid making,
let's get into where you're at now,
[SPEAKER_04]: where, where you're at currently as of the
time this podcast is going to air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I'm at in my seed making.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, well, I am at a, uh, the point where I
have already made the rubber city and I
[SPEAKER_05]: did a rigorous selection process,
trying to narrow down what I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: were the best plants out of that run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and I've grown them and cropped
them and just done everything I could to
[SPEAKER_05]: really like make sure they're what I want,
what I want to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and then I have, uh, I,
I, the one is the 10, the rubber city
[SPEAKER_05]: number 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one is the rubber city
number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe before you go any further,
just talk for a second about what made the
[SPEAKER_02]: rubber city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go forward from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the, uh, rubber city was the,
uh, sour diesel reversed onto the,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, since you start at the time,
but the four way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what, uh, I created the
original rubber city with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you hunted that a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I grew out probably right around 50
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the exact number.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew out about 50 seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are all females that you're all
females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All females.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are, they, it was just absolutely
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have, I couldn't have asked for
a better results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I ended up cloning about half the run,
uh, for backups, just because everything
[SPEAKER_05]: was looking so good, uh, halfway through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually take my clones off the flowering
plants, you know, a small branch or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that, just so that they
aren't constantly growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just re-vegging in a stasis mode
for a while until everything's finished.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when you keep a lot of moms,
you kind of have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to figure out these little
tactics to have things outgrow each other
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep things in a stasis while being
healthy at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, um, so I, I definitely selected
about half of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I did another run immediately
after the seed run was done just to double
[SPEAKER_05]: check, because some people may not notice
this, but, uh, seed plants, seed plants
[SPEAKER_05]: versus clone plants of the same exact copy
of the genetic is, can drastically differ,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, maybe not drastically,
but they can differ.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good amount, you know,
like, uh, uh, seed plants usually tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: be more vigorous and yield more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, do you guys agree with
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Hermes too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so I grew out a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made selections, a half of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I did about, uh, probably four,
maybe five rounds over the course of like
[SPEAKER_05]: a year and a half of narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just grow, you know, each grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would narrow it down from like,
you know, half of them to 20 to 15 to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, once I got to like, I remember
getting to like eight of them that I had
[SPEAKER_05]: to choose between.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like, they were all so good
that they all would have been good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had to like nitpick like this
one, this one's structure is a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: floppier than this one, but they're all
still fire, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Super good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just kind of splitting hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was splitting hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, but eventually I had, um,
I had narrowed it down after several
[SPEAKER_05]: different runs to, uh, the rubber city,
number 10 and the rubber city,
[SPEAKER_05]: number four, go figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would find two of my best selections in
the first 10 seats, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the first, I popped 15 and the
number 20 was banging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody knows he resisted the urge to
name it rubber city, 189.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his effort to make it seem like he
was going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, props on that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not concerned with the
numbers, you know, I post pictures,
[SPEAKER_05]: people know what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know what I run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually, I remember when you were
doing those selections and like the first
[SPEAKER_04]: round, you're like, Oh my God,
guys, I don't even know how I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: cut through these, let alone pick one or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the other part of it that was
funny too was he would, Pip would call me
[SPEAKER_02]: and be like, so I smoked two or three
examples and I'm now ruined and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think I can judge anymore for a while
because I'm already so baked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of have to chill out before I can
try anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause that's what happens to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like testing a large number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's like, you can only test two
or three a day, you know, cause you wake
[SPEAKER_02]: up and you try a few and then all of a
sudden your day's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to keep a fresh palette and a,
and a fresh head, you know, it's a slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Process to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to do it over the course of days,
weeks, you know, months, if you got enough
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll say one thing and then I'll shut
up and let Pip talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things I think that's cool
that not very many people out here in
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding do anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have some friends that do is that
they make a hybrid like rubber city,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they hunt the hybrid and then
they select a favorites from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they do further work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of breeding today is sort of one
step, one off one and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make it, you release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there till it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, what we're about to talk
about right now is Pip, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he made his, some of his favorite
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he, he, you know, he used those
to make more things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off with rubber band.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rubber band.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubber band is the rubber city number 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all this stuff on the, on the rubber
city drop is my rubber city 10 selection
[SPEAKER_05]: that I reversed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be the rubber city 10 cross
to a triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I named it rubber band as it's supposed to
be said all as one word, kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: headband, rubber band, headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of my take on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sour diesel, OG Kush,
the rubber city 10 is a, is definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: more of a sour diesel leaning looking type
of plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though I consider it multiple times
better than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Than sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll smoke it over sour diesel any day of
the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that's, that's what the,
that's what the rubber band is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I did a, uh, I did a couple other
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I did the, the through the chem D in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves the chem D and it's
already got those, those funky dirty,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, really, really gassy and
skunky type of like smells to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured that would be a good one to
throw against it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just produce some nice yielders and
that's called dirty rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be your, that's going
to be the dirty rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, we have the, the star dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the Corey Haim cut for rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like I said in the description,
it, the, I've always liked the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, star dog, that star dog cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high yielder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I pulled off some nice runs with it
before it makes big flowers, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: super gassy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, JJ did some good work with
really good work with that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great cropper and it's still got
gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and it shares a lot of similar
traits with my rubber city tennis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're not the same plant by
any means, uh, but they both are very
[SPEAKER_05]: vigorous growing big.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're that commercial style growth
structure and stretch and bud that you
[SPEAKER_05]: want, you know, like the colas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so I just, I figured,
you know, it'd be fun to cross them
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and, and see what kind of
craziness comes out of those things,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see you have, um, some rubber city
back cross one and rubber city back cross
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two different versions of the back
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, uh, I crossed the, uh, sour back or
the, uh, rubber city 10 to the,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also crossed it to the four way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of have a choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kind of pick something that you're
going to want to live, want to see a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more four way, or you're going
to see, want something that you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to see a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, sour, you know, yeah, the gold
coast hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold coast hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the gold coast hash plant, uh,
is my rubber city 10 selection crossed to
[SPEAKER_05]: death coast sister.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of you people are familiar with my
death coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes a lot of really good extracts,
especially solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, it's, it's really the loudest
shit I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's, it produces bunches of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I run it over my t-shirt screens and
save jars of it and send it to friends for
[SPEAKER_05]: a while factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so that their wives can scream at
them and why the house house smells like a
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so, uh, yeah, but anyway, the,
uh, the death coast was, um, out of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, the, the BC one generation I did,
I crossed, um, uh, sour diesel and death
[SPEAKER_05]: star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And made a selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, that was the popular one at the
time, but a lot of people don't know that
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a secondary selection as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, which was definitely a more sour type
of, uh, looking plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, you know, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little bit different than death
coast and I've been smoking it for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, eventually I started,
um, I was making death coast hash and I
[SPEAKER_05]: said, Oh, I'll make hash with the death
coast sister too, this time and see how it
[SPEAKER_05]: does, because every time I break it up,
you know, something's hashy when you break
[SPEAKER_05]: it up for a joint and you see,
you can just see it all fall onto the
[SPEAKER_05]: table.
[SPEAKER_05]: You move the, you move the pile of weed a
little bit and there's, there's a line of
[SPEAKER_05]: hash left, you know, after you break it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just dumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, and I've always liked the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, it just, you know, I broke that
thing up and it was, it was dumping big
[SPEAKER_05]: time, big, big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just, I just, the smoke was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I got to do something with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is too good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I crossed it to my rubber city 10
and, uh, when it was seated up,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, breaking it up when it was even,
cause seated plants are notoriously
[SPEAKER_05]: thought to not produce as much resin,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seated plants are thought to not really
produce as much resin, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this thing dumped just as good,
if not better seated as it does unseated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just, I've got the pictures on
my IG.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just after every couple ounces,
two, three ounces, breaking it up with
[SPEAKER_05]: your hands, the gloves are just so caked
that they're falling apart and ripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have to switch your gloves and
it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what is the death coast sister?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we would call like internally
the SD, uh, BX seven?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our group, that was like the first,
the first name on the label, the sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel BX number seven plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not BX seven, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's number seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so I've had that one for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, pride in one of my pride
and joys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I only, I, I, the flower is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people request the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally prefer to smoke the hash over
the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with the death coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're just, it just, the flower is
good, but I love, I love my hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I got a plant that dumps like
this, you know, that's when I,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what I'm using it for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of what I created it for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is for, uh, to, to be like a hash plant,
you know, I'm shocked at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, cause you were, you're,
this is one of the cuts you were real open
[SPEAKER_04]: with about sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why that this didn't hit the
like boom past the hype market and just
[SPEAKER_04]: shoot to the top because of dumps,
like, uh, for resin production extracts,
[SPEAKER_04]: how loud it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some people will smell this as a
straight up skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some people like, I, I smell more
burnt rubber with that backend.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to a lot of people, this is going to
be one of the skunkiest things they've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strangely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the skunk comes out stronger in
the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that happens with a
number of amplified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the skunkiness is amplified in
hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really, it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, I love my hash, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good hash too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what else we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, talk about the, uh, um, premium
rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Premium rubber is one of my pride and joy
creations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that is both of my rubber city
selections crossed together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you still there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the four and the 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The four and the 10, uh, cross together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are my two favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I, I, you know, I smoke silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke, I throw a mix other stuff in,
but my daily smoke for the past four
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has been pretty much the rubber city 10 or
the rubber city for the rubber city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 10 is more of a high, like higher
yielder than the four, like as far as like
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger buds, I shouldn't say, I mean,
it's slightly higher, higher yielder,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more along the sour side of the
spectrum, but it's still got all the gas
[SPEAKER_05]: and skunk and onion and rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all that stuff in it,
but, um, and it's like the high yielder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like the all-star.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look at that as like the,
my commercial, the commercial all-star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have the number four,
which is the which is like my headstache
[SPEAKER_05]: all-star, even though I smoke them both
the same, but the headstache one is a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit less sour diesel more like,
uh, uh, it's got the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got all the gassiness, all the
skunkiness, all the everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's got a lot of, uh, aromas and
potency from, um, the four way cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's got, it's very, very hashy,
like it burns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it, when you take a hit off a bowl and
you set the bowl down, that bowl just
[SPEAKER_05]: keeps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Burning a little trail of smoke off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you're smoking hash out of a
bowl, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but with just the weed, it like
that's, you know, and it tastes like hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and it is just one of the most potent
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it right there next to the death
star, you know, it's, it's, it's just,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, it might surpass it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, it's so, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my favorite plant that I've ever made
and I've ever selected and I'll probably
[SPEAKER_05]: have it with me till I go to my grave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still partial to the Pearl,
but this stuff for people looking for like
[SPEAKER_04]: those volatile sulfur compounds,
this is such a special plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a special plant, but don't forget
about his Pearl S ones that he's got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause those are pretty phenomenal too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no doubt, uh, people are going
to find some extremely nice plants in,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, not all of this, of course,
but especially the premium rubber,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, with that four being crossed in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, the sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there could be some, some serious
unicorns pulled out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, uh, and, um, so that's kind of
one that I, that I really, I really take a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of pride in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have the, the last one would be
the good year, which is the rubber city
[SPEAKER_05]: number 10 S ones as well, uh, cross to
cross to itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and those will be, those will be
extremely high yielding.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be more along the lines of sour,
but a lot of them are more, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: the rubber city 10 is more, it's more
dense than a sour, but it's not like
[SPEAKER_05]: dense, like indica dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not as loose as like sour is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and it's easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour is a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I mean, you can grow it and get it to
come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to get it to come out 110%,
like you really got it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really easy to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of bad sour that was
actually sour, but just bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guilty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it before, you know,
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it's just, sour is just such a
tough plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of one of the reasons I
wanted to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's just because it's these plants
are, I feel like better than sour and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they are easier to grow than sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not as finicky and sensitive and
all that kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like, you know, people say
clones lose vigor over the years and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have sour diesel in the nineties,
so I don't know what it was like back
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, today it's still a nice plant and
vigorous and it makes a good yield,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's gotten nothing on the,
on the rubber city 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just this, the reverse,
like we were talking about how alludium is
[SPEAKER_05]: like the new bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the, the rubber city number 10 is
basically like how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the new upgraded version of sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the guys in our group are running
it like that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're using it and working it into
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a new sour of bitter and crybaby
in those guys?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing maybe that I thought we should,
we could mention real quick before we run
[SPEAKER_02]: out of time here is that the, when Pip was
just talking about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these hybrids, he actually did
something that I think is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of, it's actually super
rare, which is most times when people make
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized hybrids, they're either out
crossing it to a totally different line or
[SPEAKER_02]: they are S wanting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the rarest things is to make
feminized seed from two different examples
[SPEAKER_02]: from the same line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making something like the RC 10 by the
RC four is actually something that's super
[SPEAKER_02]: rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a feminized rubber city
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for it's further work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the rarest things that
you'll see on the market because almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all feminized reversals, like I said,
are either S ones or out crosses to
[SPEAKER_02]: something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It not line work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very little feminized line work in
a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know exactly know what you'd
call RC 10 by RC four, like how you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly F1R.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what we call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What F1R F1 reversal just F2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it can't, it's the second
generation of reverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a, it's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the same line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's in crossing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a sense too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a pure rubber city line
F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it's not an F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be an F2R F2R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it is a totally different clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: F2R.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to point out that in,
in, in feminized seed, it's that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that line is one of the rarest things,
which it's line work, but made feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: style.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an outcross and it's not a,
an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not inbred.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's too full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full sisters crossed to each other,
which doesn't happen that often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen quite a bit lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are finally starting to
catch onto stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, if my theory is correct about the
super skunk trade, the Afghan T trait
[SPEAKER_04]: being a, a, a, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Double recessive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then every time you cross to the Afghan T
types together, you're reinforcing that
[SPEAKER_04]: trait and you're getting those volatiles,
sulfur compounds, like just stack it and
[SPEAKER_04]: stack it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I think is going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, this is that ultimate example of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you want some of its parents or
some of its, some of its rarest stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be in the line to pop up,
that would probably be the line to look
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, Matt, there is going to be,
I mean, I haven't done a ton of that line
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just done small populations,
but the, uh, you know, eventually I would
[SPEAKER_05]: like to throw down a couple hundred seeds
of, of, of premium rubber and the good
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, even some of the, the,
the BC work, you know, um, and just really
[SPEAKER_05]: go through them like the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, like I, in my position,
you know, up until this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only been able to test like 50
plants, around 50 plants of each line that
[SPEAKER_05]: I make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that's done me pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's given me some really nice
selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, surprisingly, uh, you know,
I really didn't think it was at first,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I first started all this,
I didn't think it was going to be that
[SPEAKER_05]: easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured I'd have to look through a
thousand seeds to, to find that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and sometimes you do,
I feel like, you know, you, you probably
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're popping Hayes maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to troll Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes you get lucky and you
find it in five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you find it in 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it takes multiple rounds because
you didn't find exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just is, you know, it's,
it's a lot of, it's a roll the dice and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of averages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 has been good for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I have found some amazing
seeds and are amazing plants and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and 50 seed populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, uh, you know, you do 50
seeds of premium rubber or the good year
[SPEAKER_05]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, we're talking, you're going to
be seeing everything those lines have to
[SPEAKER_05]: offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I mean, you're going to find,
you're going to find some really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to pop a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even really need to pop 50,
you know, like you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: get a few packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's another thing I'd suggest if
anybody's interested in like figure out
[SPEAKER_05]: what line you want and, um, and buy
multiple packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a mistake I made early on in my,
in breeding is, uh, I would go to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam and I would buy like 20
different things instead of buying a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of packs of a few different things and
having more to look through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I got excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so sometimes having more seeds of one
line is better than having, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one pack of eight different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also from a breeder's perspective,
when I get orders in, and since I'm the
[SPEAKER_04]: one filling orders and I think,
you know, it's going to be too,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we see someone old order multiple
packs of one line, like 99% of the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hook them up with like
multiple packs of other lines too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I know they're doing serious
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they're being serious about what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm more likely to do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, surprisingly it's, it's,
it's kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not very many people do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it is that rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely that rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, when I see it,
I'm like, yes, I'm going to hook this dude
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're serious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know the strain they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know they want to find the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they drop the money on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the investment and you know,
it doesn't matter what it costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you get the plant, that plant,
you can make the sky's the limit,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, however much money you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, cause you have that plant for the rest
of your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it doesn't matter if that seed
costs $20 or $30 or $40, whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, hell at the plant will pay
itself back when you grow it from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then you have it forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's always nice to find that special
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, if you, if you're going to,
if you're looking at the menu,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, just, uh, just pick a line or
two or whatever that you're interested in
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, and get a few packs of it,
you know, two pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to, you're going to be happy
with all the plants, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a lottery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a numbers game when you grow seeds is
everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like I said, I got lucky with my
number 10 and number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in the first 10 seeds of,
uh, of a larger progeny, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just the roll the dice sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but, um, but you're going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're going to be happy with
anything you get that's crossed to the
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber city 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all going to be really nice
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's always some better than
others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but like I said, it's just a numbers
game, grab, you know, two, three packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that should, that should be enough for
most people.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're like extremely serious,
you know, um, and you really just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: guarantee you're going to find like just,
you know, one, two or three or more
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome, like insane blow your mind stuff,
then, uh, you know, make the investment
[SPEAKER_05]: and get you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you at least like, yeah, 30 seeds,
40, something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can afford it, but it's not for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to get me to these,
how do they get ahold of you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they, I will be, uh, doing the release
this Tuesday at, uh, what time did I say
[SPEAKER_05]: it was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me check my notes here real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, Tuesday, January 31st,
6 PM Pacific and 9 PM Eastern time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday, January 31st.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the wrong date on the back bumper,
but thankfully we're covering it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will be able to get those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you can go to the link in my bio on,
on either on my souvenir Seedco page or my
[SPEAKER_05]: pips weed page.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a link there to take you to a
URL where you can view the menu and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything and read all the instructions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you made your, uh,
your choice, then you'll just email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I believe it was, I just made the
email souvenir Seedco.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually not souvenir Seedco.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any questions for me,
but the people running the sale and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything is not me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's only order related questions on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that email or, uh, yeah, that,
that email will be the rubber city drop at
[SPEAKER_05]: protonmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rubber city drops at protonmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you're, uh, once you've looked at the
menu and you have your order ready,
[SPEAKER_05]: then all the instructions are on that URL
and you can get ahold of us and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, and we'll get you set up nice and
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you also have your Instagram,
your Instagram page where you can find all
[SPEAKER_04]: these pictures of all these amazing
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, what's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, my Instagram, personal Instagram is a
pips weed, all one word.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my other seed company Instagram
is souvenir Seedco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, thanks for coming on and talking about
all these old strains and, and what you
[SPEAKER_04]: got going on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to have you come back on
sometime soon, you know, to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the shenanigans we've all gotten
up to this went so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured, you know, there's so much
more we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll tell my supporters out there and
everybody who's supported me through this
[SPEAKER_05]: venture and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I put a lot of care and passion and
love into what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it brings me a lot of joy to see other
people be happy from, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing my work and, uh, and, and my
strains and to hear all the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it just, it just brings me a lot
of joy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love doing what I'm going to do,
what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'm going to be taking a break for a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any plans in the near future,
but I will be back at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming on and, uh, letting
everybody hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on the show,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I'll say to that is that
in addition to the history part that Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did, uh, one of the, one of the main
reasons why we did this podcast was to
[SPEAKER_02]: give people a chance to listen to how like
weed nerds like, like to chit chat about
[SPEAKER_02]: various different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Pip is a, is a very good friend,
uh, who we've been chatting for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, uh, in private years and years,
uh, chatting about different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's cool to bring, uh,
personal friends on who have get a chance
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about their passion, their work,
what they're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think that like the way he
breeds is pretty neat because he doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really do any hype stuff too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of like, if you listen to this
podcast, he kind of like collected strains
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years and he picked favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he decided what happens if I mix
these favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is sort of like the basis for
what he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very personal approach in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he bred things he liked, which is
something I always tell people to do pick
[SPEAKER_02]: things you like and try to find things you
like, you know, and don't care about what
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of the world thinks, find things
that you think are interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this list, uh,
definitely represents that in a big way.
