[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_06]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_06]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_06]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry when seed
[SPEAKER_06]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bit of a tangent, although Dan,
I think, touched on it somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, what are your opinions on,
like, mother care?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's kind of like its own topic in
many ways, but let's just spend a few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: How different is your approach to treating
like your mother versus like your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, you're about to maybe
flower?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, one of the main differences is
you're not, you're completely training
[SPEAKER_06]: them differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're training them for clones
for the most part, as opposed to for
[SPEAKER_06]: something that you're going to flower out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're feeding it much differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not feeding it the heavy PK.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never going to bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give it a nice round regimen.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times what I'll use the moms to
do, like seed plant moms, is to make
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: More seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's such a
different mindset.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, realistically, like, it's a lot
easier to run a veg room of moms for
[SPEAKER_06]: clones than it is to ever flower anything
because, you know, most of the fuckups
[SPEAKER_06]: come in flower, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody can grow and veg pretty well for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more the practical side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do people give their moms like less
light and stuff as well, just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, you know, don't need as much or,
you know, are there other things you can
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like skimp on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, you could throw them under
T5s and have them grow even slower,
[SPEAKER_06]: but still stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of different things you can
do to maybe, quote unquote, retard growth
[SPEAKER_06]: without affecting it or hurting it too
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was running the 600 watt double
ended CMHs, I would always run them at
[SPEAKER_06]: 300, like just half strength, because it
never needed to be more than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They could stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't eat too aggressively.
[SPEAKER_06]: That meant I didn't have to do as much
training, as much cleaning, as much
[SPEAKER_06]: maintenance, because that's, that is the
other side of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's constant maintenance and
cleaning when you have a bunch of moms in
[SPEAKER_06]: a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if we wanted, at some point we
could do a little episode on like mother
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys want to see us do an episode
on mother care, leave a comment below and
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe, maybe we'll do it even though I
fucking hate grow shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still stuck on the fact that you're a
house and garden boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like, I like housing and I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met the owner of house and garden US.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve Geerder.
[SPEAKER_06]: He, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Steve Geerder?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure it was the dude in San
Diego who owns the hydroponic stores down
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He owns, what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the main hydro stores down
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally blanking right now,
but he also was like the house and garden
[SPEAKER_06]: duty always hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very, I'm a little biased when
it comes to house and garden, because they
[SPEAKER_06]: did treat me very well, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's important to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to be treated well by a company
that I support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I was nobody when they were
treating me well, you know, I still am
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody and they treat me well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to buy cases of shooting powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's the one product I've
never used.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never used shooting powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll like make your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got some PGRs of some sort
in it because it makes your flowers reset
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll be in like week six and
you'll get a full flush of white hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you, what are you meant to use
it for?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to shoot instead of root.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's supposed to convert the plant
over from shooting to rooting or rooting
[SPEAKER_06]: to shooting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like enhanced flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can like, up your yields like
10, 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a packet of powder to like a 50
gallon res once or twice in week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else on Vedge in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any weird stuff that comes to mind that
people do that you're like, why?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk to you in one weird thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of people, like I'll see it in
forums, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people see red stems, they
automatically assume it's a deficiency,
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are a lot of genetics that one
of the traits is red stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't assume just because you're seeing
red stems that it's a deficiency because
[SPEAKER_06]: there are a lot of genetics that are red
stemmed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I care to have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get on every single plant regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume it may not be genetic,
but that's something to eliminate too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else for anyone local?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any last thoughts on this before we move
on to cloning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Local fell asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the mic's not working again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, hand it over to Earn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of similar to the germination one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, like I said earlier,
Earn just does a really good job of like
[SPEAKER_01]: accounting for the things he's seen as he
was learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, also, Earn has actually filmed a
little cloning tutorial for us and might
[SPEAKER_01]: be the first of more maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one that we will probably release
next week or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't talked to Matt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's specific to what he calls Cali or
what we call Calis Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a few other names, but anyway,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a way to introduce Earn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so I've talked about this in a
bunch of different episodes or a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different, a few different episodes,
but I have tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried BWC and stuff and I've done those
kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've also tried cloning that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the owners and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me and myself, I just found that
like the most consistent way for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: clone and like cheapest and easiest and
just all around like lowest maintenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works every time for me,
has been this Calis Tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that I found out about it was
through that slow nickel on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, when you cut your clone,
the end of your clone goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sticks out in the bottom of your cube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just have this clean, dry area
where the end of your cut, like the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: end can form a Calis and heal it and like,
you know, close itself up and it like
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps bacteria and pathogens and stuff
like that from getting up inside there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was like, duh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I get a cut on my finger,
I'm going to leave it open to air and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to let it like form a scab and then
it's going to heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that was just made so much
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I started doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a bunch of different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used a ton of different like rooting
hormone solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've used Clonix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used Dip and Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used the stuff they sell at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sold, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I've kind of settled on using
Dip and Grow just because it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's super cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's and it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I use Rockwell cubes because
they're cheap and easy for me to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the way that they dry back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think having dry backs is important for
like it's important for clones too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have your cubes soaking wet all the
time, you know, it's not going to be good
[SPEAKER_02]: for the tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's I don't know how this you
want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we can loosely say that dry backs
are useful when you are trying to pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that seems to be a general principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is a good point to pass it to
Dan just because, Dan, in your mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the kind of other parameters that
you should consider when you are cloning?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Erin, obviously, like just described a
specific piece of tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are you thinking about when it
comes to like, you know, environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had two different types of setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most people that are home growing are
going to need to use like a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different humidity domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the Mondi domes I think are
the most common ones that everyone gets
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually found some cool ones on
Amazon that you can get like stacking
[SPEAKER_00]: height extensions for, which I want to try
out and just start taking like mega clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like super heavy duty
plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like ever like I break those
Mondi domes all the time, like the edges
[SPEAKER_00]: start fraying and they can cut your hands
up and same thing with like the 1020 trays
[SPEAKER_00]: that people clone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 by 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break and they rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have rough machined plastic edges and
you can cut your fingers open all day long
[SPEAKER_00]: if you work in a clone house or a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got a lot of opinions on this
shit because it was like my first longest
[SPEAKER_00]: gig was like working in black market
nurseries and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've tried literally all of it,
you know, like at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I personally like clonics,
but I do appreciate dip and grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is way cheaper and more cost effective
and it's alcohol based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're actually kind of cleaning up
that cut edge too, to a certain degree and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that in a little more,
you know, like fungal and bacterial free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really like the Aero cloners,
especially when you're just doing like big
[SPEAKER_00]: batches of single cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fastest way I've or I mean,
I've gotten root roots about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: speed in Pete plus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Aero cloners are just cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just think it's a cool piece of
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a massive amount of work to
keep clean because you have to just like
[SPEAKER_00]: gut it and bleach all the internals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of pain to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a really great success just
rocking protect and kale in from Dyna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a while back,
I can't remember what the dude's name was,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was on IG and he's the one that
taught everyone to use pool shock bleach
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the bleach they use for swimming
pools and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually works really well if you
have the dilution right to just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everything really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, you don't have to change out your
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but you sometimes you have to run
chillers with those two because the pump
[SPEAKER_00]: makes heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to like burp the excess
heat out of them like they're kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like as far as like rooting media,
you have like the three main options of
[SPEAKER_00]: like grow Dan, Oasis cubes, or Pete plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like Oasis, I think is like a
plastic type material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you only see dudes from the triangle
using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the only time if I ever get
clones from dudes in Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino, they come in a fucking Oasis
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a San Diego too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like them too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they definitely drain like free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drain the most like, you know,
I mean, you can just tilt it on its side
[SPEAKER_00]: and that water pours right out versus like
a grow Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you have to like stack a
few of them and like drain the water out
[SPEAKER_00]: and then flip it and even it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They use a lot in like traditional
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I used to when I worked at the flower
shop and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how I was first aware of them
that they were even a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they have their own like
compositional differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like Pete plugs them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have like a what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The riot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they are they the root riots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root riots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the most air space and like that
I've seen in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they be sponsoring me by now for
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like those the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to get roots faster and just
healthier, more vigorous cuts with that
[SPEAKER_00]: media for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also noticed a massive difference
in quality depending on who you get them
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because like sometimes you open up
the case and they've got like aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: like blue green molds and shit growing all
over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, huh, I don't know if this
was added or if it's just growing because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like humid and sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what took me to Rockwell was
my local hydroponic store has got those
[SPEAKER_02]: root riot cubes and I would get them all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they started just like the shape of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like there was not enough heat in
the cube, like in the mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like they didn't have enough
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got one batch and I opened them
up and they smelled weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's like super.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like they smelled sour and I was
like, OK, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got rid of them and then switch
to Rockwell just because like I just never
[SPEAKER_02]: had that issue with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I don't have a strong
opinion on those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell is really nice because I feel
like if you get the cube saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect, you don't have to water until
roots emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't at all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, you're kind of
just vegging in the tray, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that's how I kind of feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oasis cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have to do one to two small
water additions like with those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rock like Grodan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put right into a 1020 tray
and you can drain off the water or put
[SPEAKER_00]: like a slotted tray, the cube in the
slotted tray and then that one inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: no holes tray and drain off water that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to have perlite underneath the
Oasis cubes and that kind of keeps them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing your water additions,
they're not just like completely
[SPEAKER_00]: submerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wicks up from like a nice you need a
fine perlite, though, not the big and
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like a number four, number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so depending on the media,
the watering scenario may be like
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically, drastically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're switching those up constantly
and like not adjusting other parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably why like someone may be
having trouble like in their early cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like the cleanliness of the cuttings
that you're taking, like when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor and you don't have bug issues and
you're on point with your IPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're taking cuts off of like
outside plants, like that actually almost
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked me recently because I had bugs that
just came from the environment and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like ruined my whole growth that I was
just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it set me back like three or four
weeks of like having to douse everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in sulfur and like let it grow back to
healthy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's so much easier to like,
you can apply some like tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: tech that we'll get into next about like
how you initiate cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that involves like soaking it
in a mild bleach solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rinsing that off and putting it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that when I was trying to save
other people's genetic collections where
[SPEAKER_00]: they had like root aphids and spider mite
infestations and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just no way to do it other
than like literally soaking the cuts in
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach before you plug them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, before we move on to the tissue
culture section, I want to see if local
[SPEAKER_01]: has any thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slash if his mic is working now on
cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my wife, I kept disconnecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, cloning, I got to say
environment and plant health, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure these guys touch a bit on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, right now, for example,
it's a new house first winter,
[SPEAKER_03]: not like a new house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I mean, like a new
winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like I'm getting used to the like
temps of the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like ambient temps are just
way too cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of just got to figure out how to
keep warm, you know, the space heater
[SPEAKER_03]: makes the room too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even on the low settings, I might have
to get a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you keeping warm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got my two cats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something I was going to throw in
there to that local mention, but we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we fully touched on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just like mom health,
you know, obviously, that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the plant that you're taking the
cut from should be healthy, well fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you don't want to be taking
cuts from like a, you know, a wilted
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, obviously you can and
you can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you start with like the
most healthy plant to take cuttings from,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to set you up for success as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Matt, anything to add to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother health, everything for cloning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, like with with the obsolete
and thyroid, you know, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of other techniques for cloning that
a lot of people have kind of started
[SPEAKER_06]: doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess that all changes on if you or
hinges on if you trade clones or bring in
[SPEAKER_06]: clones from nurseries or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we covered that previously in
another season.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely check out that episode,
the tissue culture one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or HLV episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, Dan, we can talk, speak to what
we can invite you to speak to one of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of those topics,
tissue culture, as we have gestured
[SPEAKER_01]: towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you want to start this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think might be interesting for
our listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just kind of like an overview of
the process and then like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different texts and like phytohormones
involved in the different steps that may
[SPEAKER_00]: be useful, because you can do this stuff
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of like home tissue
culture guys and home mycology guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working out of like invert,
like, you know, they're literally totes,
[SPEAKER_00]: clear totes on their side, you know,
and they spray them down with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you don't always need a hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be, you know,
like mindful of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can have maybe one thing
here is like, are you able to kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: indicate like precisely which things can
be done at home versus things that like
[SPEAKER_01]: are definitely not doable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I think like we'll break it
down into like three sections is how I
[SPEAKER_00]: have it kind of like broken down in my
head is like there's micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more advanced techniques like
Maristem culturing and like embryo rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few other like more theoretical ones
that people don't use very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like how people develop SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the only thing that might
be more troublesome at home is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced techniques because you're
just dealing with cleanliness and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: transfers, like every time you transfer
something at home is like, or even in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, that's like when you're going to
contaminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's all possible to do at home
though, like I know people that have done
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit and just like garages and tents
in their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm no expert in this either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did a senior year in a tissue
culture lab in college, and I've been like
[SPEAKER_00]: on the outside looking in and like talking
with people that are doing the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of keep up on the current
topics and like the players involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so I'm like, you know, current with
the times, but like I don't do tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a really close colleague
that would like, he would could speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: this like leaps and bounds, but I don't
think he wants to like out himself or be
[SPEAKER_00]: very public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing that like most people
are doing is just like multiplying cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: and storing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's three to four main stages
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like your first one is just your
mother plant, like your ex vitro in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room plant, and you have to take a
cutting off of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to try and surface sterilize that
to the best of your ability, you soak it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a 10% bleach solution, and you rinse
that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: With sterilized water, which is like
something that you put through like at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, it would be a pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a lab and like work with a
group, it'll be your autoclave,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just a fancy pressure cooker with
more controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to rinse that off with
everything has to be sterile first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like you're working in a nice
clean environment with no draft,
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally with a laminar flow hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get those I've seen them
people are 3D printing them nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can buy those on Etsy now for
like 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually get a 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend that does 3D printing that
I work with and he's an absolute G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I kind of want to buy one and
then like reverse engineer it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and make a better cooler one or
just a bigger one for myself, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'll keep you guys posted on how
that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so yeah, there's initiation,
you soak it in bleach, and you try and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get that into culture and played it
on to a gel medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be gelled with like a product
called gels and or a seaweed product
[SPEAKER_00]: called auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally, you don't really need too
many hormones to initiate it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really want to root that plant right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to get it into culture
and have it be sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if you surface sterilize
properly, there are a lot of like
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic endophyte that just live in the
plant and a lot of them are bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see these like milky white
contaminants that like erupt out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut edge that's sitting in the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't really always stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like what a lot of people do is
they use antimicrobials in the media to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of make it look like they're doing
better than they actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've seen it routinely with the
work that I've been like watching what my
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues do is that like they it happens
all the time and you can have it in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: for eight months before it even expresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's actually you can find them
on Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up cannabis tissue,
culture contaminants and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some public papers that have
been published that have like
[SPEAKER_00]: categorization, like visual charts to like
point you in the direction of like what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of contaminants you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you actually get past that
initiation stage, then you go on to stage
[SPEAKER_00]: two, which is multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, you're going to be
replating your initiated plant on a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different cytokinins,
depending on like what your goal is for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking those and like doing
phytohormone research and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where you're just trying to see what
the plant's going to do with different
[SPEAKER_00]: additives and chemicals added to it,
then you may not want to elongate it that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just really depends on what your
goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are just looking to
multiply plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now there's this cool dude
called Connor Stevens, who's a friend of a
[SPEAKER_00]: colleague of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's out of Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently started a company called
Polymorphisms here in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a tissue culture lab and like
genetic preservation lab for the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial industry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he identified two IP publicly as the
[SPEAKER_00]: most productive cytokinin to use for shoot
elongation and multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually go and look up his
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually just published recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that stage, you can either send
it off to more multiplication on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: media, or you can then take it and you can
try and do Maristem cultures on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to initiate on Maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to do it once it's
already in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a comment on which
one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, if you are rooting,
that's when you would take it to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and change the hormones to something
like an IBA or an NAA, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredients in products like clonex
and dip and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can then root your plant and then
wash that gel off and take it ex vitro and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've been seeing some really
cool stuff like using Paclobutrazol in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research isn't done, so I don't want
to speak to it too much, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try all kinds of different
phytohormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all available through Sigma Aldric
and all kinds of suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That research is pretty still largely
unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are doing it privately,
but you're not going to be able to read
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm very interested in just doing
very basic research like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, hey, I put this many
plants under this varying concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: NAA versus IBA, and let's see what they do
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super, super basic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how you develop your own SOPs
because nobody's really sharing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found is the publicly
researched ones, they're published that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't all work the same in all
environments with all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are done with hemp,
which is not a one-to-one correlation with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything cannabis related for THC
production and those types of chemo bars
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you'd like to call them,
type ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've noticed that they don't really
readily work all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that you really develop these
SOPs and the model to think about it is
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like basic research, like plot
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so say I have 12 plants, or let's say
16.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a four-by-four grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in their little Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have it a gradient of IBA on one
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom left is zero micromoles of
IBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then an increase in quantity,
one micromole, five micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other axis, you have it
with NAA or a different phytohormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're actually using the spatial order
to help you index the different
[SPEAKER_01]: gradations.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything in between on that
axis is the combinations of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can test multiple chemicals and
their effects and the combination of their
[SPEAKER_00]: effects all in one little experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even stack it vertically and go in
a third dimension too, and add a third
[SPEAKER_00]: phytohormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can take it to 4D,
but I guess you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have this big, huge grid and
having it go all the way up stacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that type of research is
because people don't do it and people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't share, but I'm very open with the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't contracted away from you guys
that I can't share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I pause you here just to invite
questions from anyone else at this stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Matt, have you had any interactions
with any of these kind of chemicals or
[SPEAKER_01]: experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naphthalene, acetic acid, indole acetic
acid, indolebutyric acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all basic, different types of
breeding hormones, but not in like agar
[SPEAKER_06]: medium, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried it at home and been a big
failure at it because I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_06]: fully clean environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to do it in the house with
dogs and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a lot of success with tissue
culture, but I do have a lot of failure
[SPEAKER_06]: dealing with tissue culture people.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody else has anything they want to
add.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much direct experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked in collaboration with labs
that have done like TC and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I've seen it be performed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm familiar with the process and stuff
like that, but I've never done it myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm definitely interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a lot to get into at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've noticed is that it kind of has
to be a focus, like the main course for
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I haven't like deep dived.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like, I just, I don't really have
the time to hang out in my lab in my
[SPEAKER_00]: basement for six hours a day right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe in another year or two,
I can like start going down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you kind of do need like a
project, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To frame and constrain what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you're kind of just holding and
making a ton of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really am curious and what I want to
get into when I do build my little setup
[SPEAKER_00]: is, um, uh, getting into embryo rescue,
because I feel like that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like one of the key things that's like,
if you have these old seeds, like what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way that you could possibly do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking about earlier and
like the best way is in the hands of a
[SPEAKER_00]: really experienced, um, tissue culturist
that is like done that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't personally know that person.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, I just sent someone off to
someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's one of the most experienced tissue
culture people I know of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so he, even he said like, I'm not sure
how far along this is, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: give it my best shot, which when he says
that to me, it tells me there isn't anyone
[SPEAKER_06]: like renowned out there for that
specifics, but I know if there was,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were so many breeders that would pay
good money to have certain old seeds at
[SPEAKER_06]: least attempted to be bought, you know,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and what I see is like people always
want to, you have to like sell plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the nursery, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like the, the profit motive to
like start a tissue culture lab and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you get people to give you money to do
that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it costs an insane amount of money
to want to do this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time that directly gets in
the way of people wanting to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: their oldest stuff that actually has
provenance because they think that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to turn around and use it and profit
from it and sell it to other people maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: against their wishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I think there does need to be
room in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone that genuinely is just a
preservationist and their little setup is
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively for genetic holding for
specific clients that doesn't ever sell
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll, that'll be who's trusted
enough for, for serious people to trust
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it would take something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of going to be more of the
angle of like what I want to do with my
[SPEAKER_00]: work is like, I don't need to make
thousands and thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want an easier way to hold more
good stuff that it's like, I don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: water it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maintenance it once a month,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to see where embryonic rescue
goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, there was a lot of promise about it
just a few years ago, people making claims
[SPEAKER_06]: that they could take any old seed and do
it with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, it's, it's a lot more
complicated than just having an old seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have living cells in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be totally, you know,
dry stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before we get all the questions,
yeah, you can't do it with any old seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not every old seed will do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes living cells in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, are you allowed to disclose what you
set off with now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to who.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything old enough,
but I think it is something that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: needed in the community and needs to be
focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan, I did have another, a kind of
different angle on this, which is in your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, like with tissue culture,
what have you witnessed as like successes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just as far as like techniques and
like what's common or like, I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I just want to hear about like
some, like some stories, some anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them my story.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of scammers and TC and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that have like
the most base level understanding and like
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishments in it that like want to
sell courses and sell you that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy that can hold your whole library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they've all popped up more
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all pretty young cats and like,
I don't trust any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I know people that like do this,
um, at like a doctorate level and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't claim the things that these other
people claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been doing it with cannabis
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that research takes a lot of time and
a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't think that it's like
hidden knowledge to any extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Maristem culture is just Maristem
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you've worked in any TC lab,
you've probably done it on other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, um, it's definitely totally all
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like whether, those people have
actually put the legwork in to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, teach you how to do it and how to
optimize for what you're going to interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with in the real world versus they're
like, like there's always one plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: does what you want it to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I may be like rooting a dozen plants
on the same media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one will always like do really like
pretty well, unless it's like some weirdo
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's just like a run of the mill,
like MS media is like the most common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then like there's going to be
something that, that responds well to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rest won't, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I think is happening is
that these people find, um, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, recipes and methods that work for
one plant in particular, their little like
[SPEAKER_00]: model research plant, so to speak for
their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they teach that to other people
and they're like, yep, it'll work every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how do you pronounce the N S
word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Marshall edge and skew scooge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Japanese name and then like,
uh, like a Scandinavian name, like
[SPEAKER_06]: something weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always want to hear someone pronounce
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's actually knows how to pronounce it,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to like look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I read it, I think I can say it,
but yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds better than my mercy and
scooge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's like all science words,
honestly, like depending on where you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to school, people like, like there's no
accents in English, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, there's a common way to
like say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, people will throw like the
accent, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weirdest parts of like long,
like multi-syllable scientific words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, um, uh, like heterogenous
heterogeneous, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people that I've heard that said like
four or five different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: From like professional teachers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's cannabinoid or
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cannabinoid, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it, when it comes to intonation like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very much like a local thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a regional thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at like three syllable words,
the British and the Americans just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminium.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even spelled that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys spell it differently too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or am I, am I, am I trolling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the thing that I tried to,
it was about where the birds are mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to tell you that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not hard to fuck me on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I had to take specific courses
to know that shit in college and I still
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I took a whole mammology course that
I got like a fucking D and I was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there in my senior year and you
like had to take an upper division zoology
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a botanist, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why do I need to be like memorizing
animal skulls and like all this stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: shit just to graduate?
[SPEAKER_06]: All you need to know is the monkey and the
baboon song.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't Google it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you need to know about monkeys
and baboons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned it from my grandpa when I was a
little kid as a side name.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my grandpas taught me the monkey,
my step-grandpa taught me the monkey and
[SPEAKER_06]: the baboon song.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever look it up, it's more funny
when you see the lyrics for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone off the rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're kind of done guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, does anyone else have anything to
add about any of these topics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Diging in general, any broad advice for
newbies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we, this was pretty comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd say so for at least this far.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we covered it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said, can probably break out into
like specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talked about mother care and yeah,
they're probably a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this is probably a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, if there are things that you want
us to cover, please leave questions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we read them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it so hard to come up with new
ideas sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the stuff like it,
you know, like I've covered it in past
[SPEAKER_06]: episodes, but only so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like sometimes I'll feel like,
okay, well that's covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: No need to do it again, but maybe we
didn't cover it that well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's stuff that you would like us
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely leave that in the comments
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I just assume it's covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other thing is that people
don't, a lot of people don't go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, if we've got new viewers,
when you subscribers, a lot of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: people may not actually go into the
archive and just kind of pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some, there's some okay stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one guy in the last comments
from the Q and A and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know Dan, we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the fuck is he
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I listened back and I counted like
fucking like it's like 47, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I said, I was like, you know,
you know, the curse, the curse hits you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what's strange?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like different episodes will have
different, like we'll have different
[SPEAKER_01]: tendencies as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if one of us starts saying like a
lot, it actually spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I see it a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And local says a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, I think there was a common
comment that was like, how many likes does
[SPEAKER_01]: it take to get to the center of a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple people said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, are these guys bots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's so strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just said it twice in that sentence.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we just talk like girls from LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm a literal Valley boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I have every excuse to talk like
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am from California Valley, Southern
California Valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to say like, fuck them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by proxy, you guys all get to do it
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually knew someone who would like end
his sentence.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people who do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a friend who would end every
sentence with a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are you, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he'd say something and it would just
every, everything came off is totally not
[SPEAKER_06]: confident.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause everything sounded like a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really like, you want to go to the
store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Zealanders do this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inflection goes up at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to kind of like not, not seem too
assertive or too aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that with the personality of
this person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to stop myself when I was like,
there was like a period of time I was such
[SPEAKER_00]: a NorCal bro that I ended so many sentence
with like, you would be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had the Seattle girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seattle girl was like, why do you
always say butt fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's really obvious, like all our
tendencies when I tried to do transcripts
[SPEAKER_06]: of shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just, that's a hot mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a hot mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up hating myself personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, we're humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have glitches and like repeat ourselves
in weird ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you, if you don't like it,
leave a comment and then comment who you
[SPEAKER_06]: hate the most.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's the instructor you hate the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us next week on the linguistics
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone will just say they hate the Brit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that fucking Brit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fucking Aussie guy is didgeridoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my fault I'm Scandinavian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you were born in Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where Scandinavia is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scandinavia is a well-respected nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to try to rescue
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor and earn might actually cover some
of these like grow topics and maybe like
[SPEAKER_01]: more practical detail in the series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't seen it, it has been
unfortunately 18 plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go and look for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool one for, for newer
growers, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, for anyone they've got their
own vibe and it's, it's sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the other thing I'll point
to is that by this point, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to the show, we'll have had
both, both parts of the Shabbat 707 seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank episodes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely go check those out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good reveals in part two, I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things not well known, they weren't
covered in other shows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, big, big reveals in some cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, you know, there's,
um, lifted genetics, lifted seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: L LFTD on Instagram dirt by seeds in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we have, uh, Riot Seed Co Europe,
our good buddy, gold cut over there for
[SPEAKER_06]: all of our European seed needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have riotseeds.com for all your spray
seeds, uh, all the Cantaluminaughtii gear,
[SPEAKER_06]: all the Breeder Syndicate gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our discord with our Patreon,
which is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, you guys got me thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you want to plug.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did the bar plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll say something to booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, so booze are good by seeds,
uh, distribute seeds for us for Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently I spoke to booze and he
mentioned that, um, he is open to trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get stuff to New Zealand as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in New Zealand, you might
want to hit him up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, local earned.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys got anything you want to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Get off your chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just want to shout out my new,
uh, reversal spread directly competing
[SPEAKER_00]: with yours listed on your site.
[SPEAKER_06]: You listed on my site, former Dan's
reversal spread, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a riot sex reversal spread.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, realistically, realistically what,
what I'd like to do it because Dan's doing
[SPEAKER_06]: really good work with reversal stuff and
he's actually doing really good
[SPEAKER_06]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if his does turn out to be more
effective than mine in a, like in a more
[SPEAKER_06]: general sense, as far as applying to more
plants, then we will definitely carry
[SPEAKER_06]: farmer Dan's and we'll be doing something
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's just the most important thing
to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it my spray?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that people get the most effective
spray for the best dollar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's really what's about the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think Dan's about that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm going to be trying to just like
specialize my stuff in the future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's kind of the goal is like,
it's like, Hey, this is the G spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this is the smart,
this is the, you know, like whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like, we haven't quite gotten
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like a nice general spray,
but no, no actual commercial intentions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a spray for like lady turp,
um, lady potency type, uh, strains like
[SPEAKER_06]: skittles and, and tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They need their own special spray cause
they don't get people high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't say lady potency dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that not allowed anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the little girls out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the little ladies.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I meant.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the big ladies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not saying that all ladies are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a new term for this,
which is actually dad weep, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dad, we pack, pack taught me a dad turps
for Turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our dad turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause anytime I show a bag of like
Turpinoline Dom stuff to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, Oh, that's some old school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dad turp, dad smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, thank you guys for like helping us
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, earn local Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting us hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys all said this
already, but, um, go to riot seeds to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your blueberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the day gear is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where everybody's getting the good
seeds and everything to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for them in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I don't plug blueberry enough on
this show, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I do love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do love the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out DJ short, even though he
probably doesn't like me too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout him out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I guess, are we done local?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't have any shout outs this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No shout outs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: None.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one deserves it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out my two cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been that kind of week for local.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
