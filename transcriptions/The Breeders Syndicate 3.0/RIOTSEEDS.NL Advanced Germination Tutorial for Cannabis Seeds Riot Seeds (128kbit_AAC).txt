[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Riot Seeds Advanced
Germination tutorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a pictorial up a long time
ago, the pictures disappeared off the
[SPEAKER_00]: site, so I decided to do a video and keep
it updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: First part here, I'm showing you all the
components you'll need from beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there, antibacterial soap,
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't necessary, but I like to use
green soap to keep my hands super clean
[SPEAKER_00]: and ensure that everything in the
environment is pretty spotless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you're not seeing, I clean the
counters with green soap just so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no potential contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to avoid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there, that is 200 milliliters of
distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may or may not need, depending on what
you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a hard seed to crack and it won't
crack on its own, it won't let water in on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own, we're going to use the scissors,
but if not, let it be a ziplock baggie,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dropper, a sharpie, a paper towel,
and some tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tape will be at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, let me get a new piece of paper
towel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have a piece of paper towel on
the counter just in case anything goes
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, in case any little bit of
contamination is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that one extra barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I fold the paper towel into I
think eighths is what it is, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's into quarter, quarter size right
now, and then one more time into eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a part nobody ever fucking talks
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest reason seeds don't,
quote unquote, germinate, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do germinate, but what's
happening is a bacterial process is
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping it from completing germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shit, first, before all that,
before all that, wash your fucking hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did this, so I'm not going to
show that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be too hard to show it anyways,
but wash your fucking hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash it with antibacterial soap right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I use green soap right after
that to make sure that my hands are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely fucking spotless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't want bacteria getting to
the taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in the germination process,
a lot of people think seeds don't
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate if they come out a little bit
and get mushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if they're germinating, bacteria is
getting to the taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you are almost there,
but some kind of contamination happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use 3% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide, you can get any.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Walgreens, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a dropper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's 2,000 milliliters,
give or take 100 or 200 milliliters in
[SPEAKER_00]: this pitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pitcher's been thoroughly cleaned
with green soap, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little old, so it looks beat up,
but trust me, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we get our dropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can, let's see,
do this so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our dropper, put a little bit of
hydrogen peroxide in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that got any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, hydrogen peroxide right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put three drops in this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dump out the remaining shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this little wand, just so you don't
have to have an extra tool available,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stir that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the hydrogen peroxide's in there
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this goes in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything needs to be washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I just spray everything with
green soap at the beginning, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then wipe it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now we can take the paper towel,
put it in there, put it in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to wring it out, because this is
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is just enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sopping wet, still pretty moist,
so the water has enough water to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not excessively dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second, I have to put you down while I
grab the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're going to be using
Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the last few seeds I have of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only going to be a few seeds in
here, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Williams Wonder seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pat that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take the seeds in my hand,
there are three, and you place them evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's enough room when you fold this
paper towel over on itself to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapirou grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take this, fold it over the top to
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get your Ziploc baggie,
label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I would just put WW, but my brain
might force me to think that's White
[SPEAKER_00]: Widow, and I wouldn't know I'd be cracking
some White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to write this while looking
through the phone, so I'm writing like a
[SPEAKER_00]: half-tard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that, bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys like this all one-handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, did any seeds fall out?
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to fuck around, and that's what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the seed back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put it in the baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to put it down to put it
in the baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll bring you back and show you
what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people question this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part, but there's a good explanation
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I will take tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it to the top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to put it in a dark place
where it can be suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't work out so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is so gravity can act on the seedlings and
the taproot will grow downwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, if you leave it flat on its back,
like if I were to place it right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: downwards, the taproot sometimes grows in
a circle, you know, trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: downwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to try to grow down with
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you won't have curly Q
seedlings that are really hard to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just shut the cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voila fucking law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works, folks.
