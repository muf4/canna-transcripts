[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_05]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_05]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_05]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_05]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry when seed
[SPEAKER_05]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an old video from the Neville's
Cannabis Castle, and I didn't want to just
[SPEAKER_01]: start it without an introduction,
so there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an old video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ripped a long time ago digitally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just an inside sneak peek into
Neville's Cannabis Castle, and I know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard for some people to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know it exists,
so I decided to put it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me be the special guest for tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling kind of red, kind of red.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of freedom to my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mood is very right, very right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me be the special guest for
tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, follow me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of a smokey word now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling kind of mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you put me in the mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't you looking very right, very right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me be the special guest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling kind of high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the reason in the sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the stars are shining bright,
very bright.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me be the special guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere on the peaceful spot in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stands the legendary Cannabis Castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the 1994 Cannabis Cup, a tour was
organized to this famous place for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone who was interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the bus trip, the guests were
welcomed by the noble hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were treated with delicious food and
drinks, and of course, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the visit, everyone also got a
guide a tour and a chance to see all those
[SPEAKER_00]: famous water plants from which all seeds
originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about that mysterious appearance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here follows an impression of that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am feeling high.
[SPEAKER_07]: High, high, high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only January.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling kind of mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you put me in the mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ain't you looking very right, very right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me be the special guest for the
night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling kind of high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the reason in the sky.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the stars are shining bright,
very bright.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me be the special guest for the
night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on and rub, come rub, come rub,
come and rub with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said to rub, to rub, to rub,
rub and rub with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am feeling high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, we have something
very special this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already announced it at the
Cannabis Cup award that we have a variety
[SPEAKER_02]: that is very dear to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The existence of this variety is a long
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a story of the phantom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a real phantom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the phantom of this castle exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here, it's there, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a brother of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's someone in the spirit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We produce many varieties in this castle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time again, it is from all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something from Australia, something from
America, something from Ireland,
[SPEAKER_02]: something from Poland, Russia,
Italy, from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect it, and we brew, and we brew,
and we come out with strains that are very
[SPEAKER_02]: famous in the world, like Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Northern Lights that come from this
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real Northern Lights, as you see it
now these days, that is the place where it
[SPEAKER_02]: is being brewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that with greenhouses,
but especially with the phantom,
[SPEAKER_02]: the spirit of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I can call the spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to do it now because we produce
a new variety of grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new thing that many, many people
will talk about it for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure of, because I work with the
phantom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I call the phantom.
If I call the phantom, if I'm lucky,
and if you've got the spirit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, maybe it's there, maybe you come
out, then it can show you something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then we can open the magic safe,
the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: See bank, where's it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of the window, get out of there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's take a seat.
[SPEAKER_10]: What
[SPEAKER_02]: is no game?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's an open world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should not be a game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he allows me to open the safe,
the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you see, since you see the bank,
all we got inside there is the spirit of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new variety, Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm out of the panel.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't show the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just for smoking, not for taking
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, you will get some new grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, just take for the bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it for the bones.
[SPEAKER_10]: And smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let go of it, smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you fuck it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Smoke it, smoke it, smoke it,
[SPEAKER_10]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got that on my hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to do rock wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you have to think
ecologically as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a year from today, we'll have a
plan, a medium based on hemp herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've done some testing for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first results look real promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoke in houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually use this in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you can work with the
lights as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two different systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the light system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the blinding system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do five crops a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do about three because of the winter
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't need actually the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also we have some goose.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fly on to our house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feed them hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, you know, they came three.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about eight now or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very happy and they want more
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a greenhouse with just some
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just again mother plants,
some varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a flow system and it sprays
on top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: No spray water on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep the humidity around 80 to 90
percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't keep it on too long because
otherwise the water will hit the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's already doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the rest it's not so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back to the other side of the
castle.
[SPEAKER_11]: Room
[SPEAKER_12]: number four is our main flowering room in
the castle.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has always been a place where we
checked out different varieties and look
[SPEAKER_12]: what they did.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we just flowered testing quality and
different strains.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I don't always listen.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's go back.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?
I'm feeling kind of high.
