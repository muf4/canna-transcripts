[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to bring Colonel Stevens up
to get the thing going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be a joint
presentation with
[SPEAKER_03]: Wendell and with Randy Winters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wendell is the modern treasure for all of
us in ufology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wendell has been knee deep in everything
we are talking about since the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I mean he is a live, living treasure
chest and encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have never met anyone in my life
that is more open to everyone,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone that has questions and desires to
know about the phenomena.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in his home.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets phone calls literally from around
the world almost non-stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: By people wanting information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he doesn't turn anybody away.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a treasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A real treasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Wendell Stevens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well it's a pleasure to be here and I'll
try to stand far enough back from this
[SPEAKER_05]: microphone so I don't get all of those
bloopers on getting too close to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably best known for my release of
the material in the investigation of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Billy Meyer case.
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens to be the 20 year anniversary
of the beginning of those contacts with
[SPEAKER_05]: Edward Meyer in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not the beginning of his contacts
however.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the point where his contacts
began with human beings who told him that
[SPEAKER_05]: they came here from a star group we call
the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we called them Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what he called them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what they call themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got into the case through my collection
of UFO photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lusine Stag who was a niece of Carl
Jung in Switzerland, a multilingual
[SPEAKER_05]: journalist, wrote articles in four
languages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also one of the earliest UFO researchers
in Europe and published the first UFO
[SPEAKER_05]: magazine in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Published it in Basel in German.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was began in her area not too far
from where she lived in Basel.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Hinwell south of Zurich.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she heard about it as soon as word got
out of the small group there which took
[SPEAKER_05]: several months to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: She went to meet the man and she found him
to be very honest and sincere.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the poorest of poor.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was living in a at that time he was
living in a renovated chicken house on a
[SPEAKER_05]: property that belonged to absentee owners
living out of the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was living there as a watchman for
a living.
[SPEAKER_05]: A time came shortly after the information
got out locally and people came from
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He became a liability rather than an asset
and the owner of the property told him
[SPEAKER_05]: he'd have to go and put another guard in
there that didn't have so many visitors.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point the friends around Meyer
pooled their small resources and made a
[SPEAKER_05]: down payment on a property where they
could bring Mr. Meyer and his family to
[SPEAKER_05]: live with them all together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they began modifying a barn on the
property and they made six or seven
[SPEAKER_05]: bedrooms and they all lived on it
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they worked on it for many months and
years building it into a livable facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not a group of people that had
a lot of resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of assets and a lot of material
to work with Mr. Meyer had a camera that
[SPEAKER_05]: had been given to him by somebody else
because it was an old camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good Japanese camera but it was
an old one had been dropped.
[SPEAKER_05]: The viewfinder or the the focus adjustment
had been jammed just a little bit short of
[SPEAKER_05]: infinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mirror in the viewfinder had and it
was beside the lens viewfinder had fallen
[SPEAKER_05]: over been knocked down.
[SPEAKER_05]: He couldn't look through the viewfinder at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just held the camera out like this and
shot his pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was not a very good photographer
although he had taken a number of pictures
[SPEAKER_05]: before he just loaded the film in the
camera and shot the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: He shot all of his pictures on ASA 100
slide film positive slide film with a
[SPEAKER_05]: setting of F11 and one to one hundred and
twenty fifth of a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't make any changes in the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just used it all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had also been shooting pictures before
in another contact series with other
[SPEAKER_05]: extraterrestrials in India with another
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was before he lost his arm and
could use the camera effectively.
[SPEAKER_05]: The camera that he was using that I found
amusing when I got there was a type that
[SPEAKER_05]: he could roll the film snap the picture
and everything all with one hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: By this time he had lost one arm in a bus
accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here was a man that was seriously
handicapped had a broken camera didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have any money had some good friends
around him but they were all very close
[SPEAKER_05]: friends all talking to each other that was
taking these remarkable pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that impressed Lewis in stock who had
a sizable collection of photographs at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time when I got there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since we had been exchanging photos
for some time and she now had Mr. Mark
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad gladly gave her a dozen of the
pictures right out of his his box there is
[SPEAKER_05]: they were prints made from the slides
positive to positive which was a process
[SPEAKER_05]: that was current then in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a year or two later here in the
states we can do it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she thought the pictures were
remarkably good.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was able to talk to a number of other
witnesses there with my or some of whom
[SPEAKER_05]: had seen the craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was able to view some of the landing
sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was convinced that the contacts
were going on but she didn't like the case
[SPEAKER_05]: because they didn't have a Jesus Christ
and she was a born again Christian and she
[SPEAKER_05]: thought that if you're not with him you're
against them and they must have been
[SPEAKER_05]: representatives of the signs of the times
mentioned in our revelation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she brought me the pictures anyway to
show them to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her and Timothy Good were coming to the
United States the following month to do
[SPEAKER_05]: some investigation in the Adamski case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now lose in stock was the lady that George
Adamski stayed with when he was in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the translator that took him to the
Hague to talk to the king and queen of
[SPEAKER_05]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the one that accompanied him to the
Vatican to talk to the pope.
[SPEAKER_05]: She accompanied him on other official and
state visits that he carried out when he
[SPEAKER_05]: was in Europe at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she knew Mr. Adamski quite well.
[SPEAKER_05]: She also was his translator for his second
trip to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now with Mr. Adamski's death she wanted
to confirm come to the states and confirm
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the earlier information that she
understood but had not seen personally and
[SPEAKER_05]: she went to Vista California where he
lived where she contacted Mr. Glenn
[SPEAKER_05]: Steckling at the time who ended up with
Adamski's property and material.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now lose in stock calls me and said
she's coming to the states with him and
[SPEAKER_05]: that she's going to bring me some
remarkable pictures that I'll surely want
[SPEAKER_05]: to see if I would meet her at the bus
station when she gets in.
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd be happy to let me take a look at
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I told her to call me when she got
there and she did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a month later I picked her up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I happened to have in my house at the time
Lee and Britt elders visiting from Phoenix
[SPEAKER_05]: at the time that I picked lose in stock up
and I brought her home and I introduced
[SPEAKER_05]: her and Tim good to lose it to Lee and
Britt elders.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a private investigation
organization in Phoenix called Intercept
[SPEAKER_05]: and the organization's business was to
look at computer systems bank intelligence
[SPEAKER_05]: systems bank master five miles and things
like that electronically looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: penetration for somebody else trying to
get information out of the banks out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the mines and out of a number of places.
[SPEAKER_05]: They they were doing fairly well at their
business because everybody was paranoid
[SPEAKER_05]: about everybody else it seems like and
they were successful in finding the bugs
[SPEAKER_05]: and so they were doing well in their own
private intelligence network.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried to interest them in going to
Switzerland with me to look the man in the
[SPEAKER_05]: eye and they were not interested in UFOs
and could care less about the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: They thought they were remarkable and all
but that ended it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They drove on home that night and I didn't
see them again for some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to get lose in stock to leave me
copies of the pictures and she said she
[SPEAKER_05]: had promised not to but finally she let me
photograph five of them in dim light in
[SPEAKER_05]: the kitchen of my house so I could
remember what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she offered to translate
communications between too close.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: She offered to translate communications
between myself and Mr. Meyer which by now
[SPEAKER_05]: that I've seen the pictures I've got
they're the best I've seen anywhere at any
[SPEAKER_05]: time and I've got to get to the bottom of
this myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact I thought they were too good to be
true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wrote letters to Mr. Meyer asking
questions and she'd translate my letters
[SPEAKER_05]: to German send them to Billy and he'd
write the answer back in German.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'd translate them to English and
send them to me after three or four quick
[SPEAKER_05]: exchanges in one month.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said this is getting to be too much
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to bring somebody else
into this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she brought in a lady Ilse Von Jacobi
another German journalist who was also
[SPEAKER_05]: multilingual was writing articles in
Italian French German and English and Mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss Von Jacobi also translated several
letters for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and by this time I've decided that
it's too slow taking too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to go look him in the eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: And about that time I got my income tax
refund on my tax on my home.
[SPEAKER_05]: My and it was enough to make the trip to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought a ticket and I wrote Ilse Von
Jacobi and asked her how to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said I'll have to go with you
because he doesn't speak any English.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I said fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I arranged to take her.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to pick her up in Wiesbaden
and go to Switzerland which we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally got to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I got interested into got
introduced into the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just developed from there kind of I
never intended to get as deeply in it as I
[SPEAKER_05]: am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably best known for my release of
information out of the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I should tell you here that the
information that was being given to Mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meyer was never intended for public
release.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was intended for a small group of
people around him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that it would be wise to let
the rest of the world know what was going
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I released it against their will and
without their permission.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wrote three articles for Saga
magazine which brought the house down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got visitors from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that many people read Saga
magazine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they they had so many visitors that
enables neighbors complained about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got the village that the district
police to issue a an order prohibiting the
[SPEAKER_05]: assembly of more than eight people on the
property at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course 18 lived there and just
harassment like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He survived by this by the time I got
there the first time which is several
[SPEAKER_05]: months after I'd written the article.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had survived four assassination
attempts already.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the time I got there the second
there the second time had gone to seven by
[SPEAKER_05]: the time I had the third time had gone to
twelve.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he now has successfully survived
17 assassinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has successfully survived 16
assassination attempts on his life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the 14th one I happened to be with
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was was we'd been in the house trying to
correct some translations of hit the
[SPEAKER_05]: contact notes that I had had arranged for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wasn't satisfied with the English
translations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to redo it paragraph by paragraph
to to get him to to agree that it was
[SPEAKER_05]: reasonably correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at about 10 15 at night after hours of
this he said let's go outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted to go outside and smoke a
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said why don't we go out and get some
fresh air and we can do this resume this
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did and we walked out the back door
of his house.
[SPEAKER_05]: The kitchen went out to a lean to and a
lean to went to the end of the lean to and
[SPEAKER_05]: out into the street in front.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had an old car seat sitting to the
right of the door as you came out and we
[SPEAKER_05]: came out there and sat down on a car seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got out of cigarettes and we sat down
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was right beside me like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we sat down and I moved to pull my
pencil up a little bit so they wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_05]: tight on my knees always bothers me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I did that he was jerked across the
front of me like that and came down across
[SPEAKER_05]: my lap and he started to get up and again
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we heard a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We first felt debris falling on us like a
rat in the rafters.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was rafters above us which that's
what I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was raised on a farm in the
rats and the rafters kick dirt off on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we heard the shot and he said
that was a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he turned around and put his finger in
a bullet hole in a wall a cavity left by a
[SPEAKER_05]: bullet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it's still hot the bullets behind
the chair.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we pulled the chair out and sure
enough there was a 30 caliber dumb dumb
[SPEAKER_05]: bullet there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he said let's get a flashlight and go
see about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we went hands and knees into the house
got a big long flashlight like this came
[SPEAKER_05]: out with that and a rifle and went out
searching in his garden for somebody that
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like the idea because the guy had
the other guy surely got a rifle out there
[SPEAKER_05]: too and he can see us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got flashlights and he's in the dark
but Billy Billy was determined to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was trooped along with him and we
found a spot where a man had stood in his
[SPEAKER_05]: garden long enough to leave a packed
circle footprints on top of footprints
[SPEAKER_05]: like this where he'd been out there
shuffling his feet like this waiting until
[SPEAKER_05]: we came up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he had plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He must have had a night scope on his
rifle he had had plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about as far away as from here to
the lighted doors on the side other side
[SPEAKER_05]: of the room there and he had a night scope
and if Meyer had not been drawn across my
[SPEAKER_05]: lap at that time it would have gone
through his forehead the bullet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if they're playing tricks to give me a
thrill it sure did because that could have
[SPEAKER_05]: got me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think Meyer was playing those
kind of games.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now I know for sure that what he's
telling me about the assassination
[SPEAKER_05]: attempts and many of them are witnessed by
other people there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that some of them are really
happening because I just witnessed one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me characterize the man a little
bit for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a man of destiny from birth to now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came into this world at the beginning
of the Great World War 2 and from his home
[SPEAKER_05]: in Bullock Switzerland he watched the
American bombers and the German fighters
[SPEAKER_05]: battle it out over the river across from
him in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was baptized a strict Lutheran as a boy
but was subsequently led through all the
[SPEAKER_05]: great religions of the world in where he
experienced or for experience rather.
[SPEAKER_05]: He enlisted in the French Foreign Legion
in France when he was in his early teens
[SPEAKER_05]: or late teens and he was sent to the
French outpost of Algeria for training.
[SPEAKER_05]: He completed that and deciding that the
Legion wasn't the place he wanted to spend
[SPEAKER_05]: the rest of his life decided to leave it
and he managed to escape from the Legion
[SPEAKER_05]: by walking across the Sahara Desert feet
unequal before his time and he was joined
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He joined a desert caravan.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had three men with him two of them died
on the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: He joined a desert caravan working his way
to the Red Sea where he was captured by
[SPEAKER_05]: pirates Red Sea pirates and enslaved
aboard their Dow working for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was favored by putting him ashore in
Iran.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Persian Gulf because he did what
he's told to do and they liked him and
[SPEAKER_05]: from there he made his way to India where
he studied literature a great teacher in
[SPEAKER_05]: the Ashoka Ashram at Marali India in near
just north of New Delhi.
[SPEAKER_05]: That teacher in the great teacher in the
Ashram was known as the Cambodian monk and
[SPEAKER_05]: he still lives today and he's 106 years
old and he says his words are Mr. Meyer
[SPEAKER_05]: was a spiritual man.
[SPEAKER_05]: From there from the age of five let me get
this thing out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The light is I don't think I can raise the
light so I'll just tip this a little
[SPEAKER_05]: better here.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the age of five Meyer was guided and
educated by ET intelligences preparing him
[SPEAKER_05]: for the role that he now plays as the head
of a spiritual research and development
[SPEAKER_05]: center in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is surrounded by others chosen to share
in his present role there where the center
[SPEAKER_05]: is created and designed to endure and
survive for at least the next 700 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is a long-term UFO contact.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to end overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to end in your or my
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is certainly not anything like the
run-of-the-mill type.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meyer's first contacts were with an old
man in a pear-shaped silvery gold ship who
[SPEAKER_05]: educated him in many ways using a big
helmet that he put over his head with
[SPEAKER_05]: wires or going into the helmet and
blinking lights on it and he would leave
[SPEAKER_05]: in there for 15 or 20 minutes at a time
where it filled his consciousness and his
[SPEAKER_05]: subconscious mind with myriads of ideas
and vast knowledge that he could not begin
[SPEAKER_05]: to describe but which came back to him
later in life as he needed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he was he had to leave school when in
the sixth grade because he couldn't afford
[SPEAKER_05]: to go anymore and he was the poor child in
the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have shoes to go to school.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have new pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have new shoes or new shirt and
he became the butt of jokes and pranks
[SPEAKER_05]: played by the more affluent members of the
school and he became disenchanted with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He quit going to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They promoted him from the fifth to the
sixth grade to get him out of the fifth
[SPEAKER_05]: and then he didn't go back but two or
three days in the sixth grade and left the
[SPEAKER_05]: school.
[SPEAKER_05]: This education was being conducted by
another extraterrestrial entity group who
[SPEAKER_05]: told him that they came from the doll
universe, D-A-L universe and he didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: know what it was at the time and later
with more questions on where they came
[SPEAKER_05]: from and how they lived they told him that
their universe was a balancing counterpart
[SPEAKER_05]: of our physical universe that we perceive
and experience and that it exists because
[SPEAKER_05]: ours exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh thank you Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Meyer had after the training
session with the old man which lasted
[SPEAKER_05]: almost a year that stopped for several
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: He earned his living in a routine way and
then a new series of contacts began with
[SPEAKER_05]: another female who said she came from the
doll universe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could call her Asket and it was Asket
that led him through the various religions
[SPEAKER_05]: led him on his trips across the desert,
some adventures that took him to death's
[SPEAKER_05]: very door on a number of occasions where
his survival tested his ingenuity and his
[SPEAKER_05]: control of fear which he had to learn for
other reasons but above all he learned
[SPEAKER_05]: faith in himself, vital training for the
events to come.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was she who prepared him for his future
contacts with the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edward Meyer observed and photographed the
doll ships of several different varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: for years, more than nine years and he
went aboard the doll ships many times even
[SPEAKER_05]: before meeting Semyasi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we knew all this when we were
investigating the case and we knew we
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't tell it all at one time,
it's too big.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we decided to start where the contacts
with Semyasi, the Pleiadian team began,
[SPEAKER_05]: that team was changed in his language,
customs and habits and could discuss
[SPEAKER_05]: things at great length with him and we
terminated our reporting of the case where
[SPEAKER_05]: that team left for other assignments in
another solar system so we capsized what
[SPEAKER_05]: we released but we had a great deal more
on the case that we have never released.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went aboard the doll ships many
times before meeting Semyasi.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took over 300 photographs of the doll
ships singly and in different groups of up
[SPEAKER_05]: to eight craft together at a time in the
sky while he was in India and in the mid
[SPEAKER_05]: east, near mid east.
[SPEAKER_05]: These photographs and all of his
possessions were taken from him by
[SPEAKER_05]: Jordanian secret police when he was
working his way back from India where he
[SPEAKER_05]: had been persuaded to infiltrate a drug
smuggling operation for US agents to make
[SPEAKER_05]: a living and make money and when it was
intercepted they dumped him, they let the
[SPEAKER_05]: Iranians have him along with the drug
smugglers and it took them some time
[SPEAKER_05]: before they obtained a release for him but
when the Iranians released him they just
[SPEAKER_05]: turned him out and told him to go and they
didn't give him his possessions,
[SPEAKER_05]: money, pictures or nothing, don't know
whatever happened to those.
[SPEAKER_05]: His personal things were not returned.
[SPEAKER_05]: All he has now of those photos and contact
reports are copies of a few that he had
[SPEAKER_05]: sent out to friends before his loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those pictures photographed before
thousands of eyes at the New Delhi
[SPEAKER_05]: railroad station were published on the
front page of the New Delhi daily
[SPEAKER_05]: newspaper the next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The local villagers around the Ashoka
Ashram at Morale according to Fobal Chang,
[SPEAKER_05]: a ten year old girl at the Ashram at the
time who knew Mr. Meyer very well because
[SPEAKER_05]: of his pet monkey that did many tricks,
said that the villagers were suspicious of
[SPEAKER_05]: Meyer because of his contact with a
celestial woman, a woman that they saw
[SPEAKER_05]: come from the sky in a silvery ship,
get out and talk to Meyer, go back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: ship and leave and this was observed by a
number of the villagers who also watched
[SPEAKER_05]: Meyer photograph the doll ships from a
distance sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on the 28th of January 1975 when
Meyer experienced his first contact with
[SPEAKER_05]: the Pleiades and that's where I began my
reporting and so for those of you who are
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar with the case that you know about
it from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Semyasi's small team of six Pleiadians was
especially trained in the language customs
[SPEAKER_05]: and habits of Meyer and the people around
him in his area and so they were able to
[SPEAKER_05]: carry on extensive dialogue on science,
history, many cultures, our relationship
[SPEAKER_05]: with our past and our future.
[SPEAKER_05]: They told him they would come from a
common ancestry that we are no more than
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleiadians slowed down in our evolution by
our own actions and that we could be where
[SPEAKER_05]: they are today if we hadn't done this.
[SPEAKER_05]: She actually posed her ship in the form of
flight demonstrations for Meyer to
[SPEAKER_05]: photograph for very special reasons which
mostly failed and you know the rest of the
[SPEAKER_05]: story from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that I'm going to run you some
photographs taken by Meyer but first of
[SPEAKER_05]: all I want to tell you how this developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: After I published the article in Saga
magazine, the first article in Saga
[SPEAKER_05]: magazine people started writing me,
reminding me or telling me of other
[SPEAKER_05]: alleged contacts by Pleiadian humans with
earth humanity and they kept coming and
[SPEAKER_05]: the contacts were, when I started the
investigation in the Pleiadian contact
[SPEAKER_05]: studies in 1976 which is the next year
after the contact began, they'd already
[SPEAKER_05]: been going on for over a year and a half
and they'd been kept in relative secrecy
[SPEAKER_05]: within the very small closed group up to
that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very few people knew about them except for
a few local UFO researchers that had
[SPEAKER_05]: picked up the rumors and gone to find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up to that time I had never heard of UFO
contacts from the Pleiades before and the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole idea was fascinating and very exotic
and quite possibly not even true at least
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what I thought then.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a time I thought these Pleiadian
contacts originated with Edward Meyer on
[SPEAKER_05]: the 28th of January, their first contact
with him and I didn't know anything about
[SPEAKER_05]: any other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got on scene and began working
directly with Meyer and the other
[SPEAKER_05]: witnesses there, there were a lot of other
witnesses, I interviewed 18, I discovered
[SPEAKER_05]: that these same UFOs had been using
another contactee before Edward Meyer by
[SPEAKER_05]: the name of M.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rashid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rashid was a Greek Orthodox priest of the
little church in Jerusalem who had been
[SPEAKER_05]: their contactee for a time before picking
Meyer up for the first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the contact notes being kept by the
Swiss group showed that Meyer had been
[SPEAKER_05]: told that this group had at least two
other active contacts on Earth with Earth
[SPEAKER_05]: humans going on at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They told him that theirs was not the only
inhabited planet in the Pleiades,
[SPEAKER_05]: a comparatively young star group and that
other similar humans from some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: other planets were space travelers and
some of them were even coming here to
[SPEAKER_05]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: They told him that their group had contact
operations going on in the Orient and in
[SPEAKER_05]: the western part of North America but
would not reveal any more saying that it
[SPEAKER_05]: had nothing to do with their relationship
with Mr. Meyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I released that amount of relevant
information it stirred up a real storm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the next three years my attention was
called to several other UFO contact cases
[SPEAKER_05]: where the UFOknots said they came from the
Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first was the discovery that a
well-known Argentine UFO researcher,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Fabio Zarpa of Buenos Aires was
investigating a case involving Pleiadian
[SPEAKER_05]: contacts with engineer Enrique Rincon of
Bogota, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also a profound series of ongoing
contacts that began in November 1973 now
[SPEAKER_05]: this before Mr. Meyer's contacts began in
November 1973 and was still going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought his was the only such case also
although he had been told by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleiadians visiting him that there were
other Pleiadians in that star group,
[SPEAKER_05]: other humans in that star group and some
of them coming here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in 1979, that's four years after Mr.
Meyer's contacts began, a correspondent
[SPEAKER_05]: who had read my magazine article in Saga
called my attention to another contactee
[SPEAKER_05]: case involving Pleiadian extraterrestrials
who were visiting one Senor Guillermo
[SPEAKER_05]: Torres of Hacienda Las Cruces in Venezuela
and this had been going on since 1974.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a year before Mr. Meyer's contacts
began.
[SPEAKER_05]: These Pleiadian ETs were also entirely
human as with the ones visiting the
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombian and those that were visiting Mr.
Meyer but these contacts were centered
[SPEAKER_05]: near El Tocuyo on the north coast of
Venezuela in this hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: These ET visits and contacts were still
going on also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all of these are going on
simultaneously while I'm doing this and
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of pages of notes and technical
dialogue had been recorded by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Venezuelan group including extensive
discussions of scientific subjects,
[SPEAKER_05]: the history of our planet, the history of
humanity on it and a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also kept highly confidential
within a small select group there in
[SPEAKER_05]: Venezuela, a group of participants who
were not letting the star story out of
[SPEAKER_05]: their group either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then in 1983, Lou Farish of the UFO News
Clip Service sent me some notes on another
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleiadian contact case that began in July
of 1974.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also before Mr. Meyer's contacts
and was also still going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involved one Charles A.
[SPEAKER_05]: Silva who was repeatedly met by an
extraterrestrial human woman who said he
[SPEAKER_05]: could call her Ramatis and that she and
the other UFOs associated with her came
[SPEAKER_05]: here from their home in a star group we
call the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those contacts were taking place in
southern Peru and they also are still
[SPEAKER_05]: going on at this time, the time is
investigating this, they were still going
[SPEAKER_05]: on and up to that time, Silva described
those contacts in a 411 page book
[SPEAKER_05]: privately published which he called The
Date with the Gods which got little
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution, very few people ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another correspondent who had purchased a
copy of our preliminary report of
[SPEAKER_05]: investigation on the Swiss case wrote me
and gave me the address of another
[SPEAKER_05]: contactee whose extraterrestrial visitor
told him that he came from the Pleiades
[SPEAKER_05]: and more specifically from the Alcione
system, that's the brightest star we see
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: His experiences began with that,
with the UFO sightings that led up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: later face-to-face contacts between him
and those extraterrestrials and long
[SPEAKER_05]: discussions of scientific and technical
subjects and the history of the human race
[SPEAKER_05]: here on this planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these were discussions carried out
with a Mr. Delmar Duveres and that's a pen
[SPEAKER_05]: name adopted by that man in favor of his
contactor said that he could call him
[SPEAKER_05]: Delmar Duveres and he didn't want his own
name used so he used that false name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those contacts continued both face-to-face
contacts and telepathic contacts for some
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They continued for many years as a matter
of fact and we're still going on at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time I was doing this and a whole
philosophy of life and being an earth
[SPEAKER_05]: man's relationship to the greater plan was
imparted and in 1973 Mr. Duveres published
[SPEAKER_05]: this information in a 214 page book called
The Golden Read.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's a lot of information being
imparted here by these human
[SPEAKER_05]: extraterrestrials who say they come from a
star group we call the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: About that the time I received that book I
received a registered letter from
[SPEAKER_05]: Argentina from another old friend senior
Pedro Romniac of Buenos Aires who had seen
[SPEAKER_05]: something concerning my activities with
the Swiss case and he was writing me to
[SPEAKER_05]: telling me that he had been in contact
with ET beings who told him that their
[SPEAKER_05]: home was in the star system we call El
Sion and the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: I received scores of letters from sincere
people who claimed that they had observed
[SPEAKER_05]: UFO craft that were very similar even
identical to some of the craft pictured in
[SPEAKER_05]: the preliminary report which were the
pictures taken by Mr. Myers and some of
[SPEAKER_05]: them were quite accurately the same
pictures very similar craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the UFO clubs were receiving these
two which infuriated them to the extent
[SPEAKER_05]: that none of them ever told me what they
were receiving.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to get my information from those who
were put down by the clubs were even
[SPEAKER_05]: reporting anything to the clubs in the
first place about the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all became or nearly all of them
became incensed because I didn't take them
[SPEAKER_05]: in on the contacts that I was studying in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very close friends with the
Lorenzins, with Hayden Hughes,
[SPEAKER_05]: with other researchers that had come and
gone over the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never tried to ally myself with the
NYCAP group because they were a government
[SPEAKER_05]: agency the private organizations were at
the time were APRO out of which MUFON grew
[SPEAKER_05]: and Hayden Hughes over in Oklahoma City
and a couple in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were angry because each one was
angry because I considered myself good
[SPEAKER_05]: friends with the directors of them and
they considered me a good friend and I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't take the case to them so each one
of them separately became disturbed
[SPEAKER_05]: because I hadn't brought the case to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll tell you why I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got there and found out how big the
case was, how many witnesses were
[SPEAKER_05]: involved, how many photographs were
involved, there's over 800 photographs and
[SPEAKER_05]: how many sites?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was more than 20 sites and that it
involved police, it involved the Swiss
[SPEAKER_05]: Army, it involved communications people,
it involved the security guard in the
[SPEAKER_05]: area, it involved Swiss intelligence,
West German intelligence, Russian
[SPEAKER_05]: intelligence, Czech intelligence,
East German intelligence, and Italian
[SPEAKER_05]: intelligence were all involved in pursuing
Mr. Meyer, all trying to collect as much
[SPEAKER_05]: information as they could for the
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So realizing that it's going to take a
number of trips back and forth to
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland, that it's going to take
staying power.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't be somebody that works for a
living, draws a salary, has only a weekend
[SPEAKER_05]: off and can only spend a half a day on
Saturday afternoon investigating the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have to be somebody that can
go there several times, maybe a dozen
[SPEAKER_05]: times, maybe 25 times, going to have to
stay for two to three weeks at a time
[SPEAKER_05]: which means if you're working you're going
to lose your job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that meant that automatically excluded
almost all of the clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have such investigators,
they didn't have money, they didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: resources, there was no way any club in
existence at the time could do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I turned back to the folks that were in
my home at the time that Luz Instag
[SPEAKER_05]: brought me the pictures, Lee and Britt
Elders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had the intercept group and they
were doing fairly well and they had
[SPEAKER_05]: staying power.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were doing jobs all over the United
States, all over the Western Hemisphere
[SPEAKER_05]: and also Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had a job coming up in London for
a big banking system in London looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: penetration of the bank communication
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were going to be in Switzerland
at the time that I was going to be there
[SPEAKER_05]: on my third trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked them to join me and see what I
was looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when they got there and we went
over the sites again and I showed them how
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be impossible for anybody to
stage this even with elaborate equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of money, a lot of resource and a
whole lot of Confederates.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They became convinced that the case was
worth studying and they began to put their
[SPEAKER_05]: own money in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put mine in, we went back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there 14 times, they went 12 or 13
each and it kept going on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we didn't take the clubs in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why the clubs were basically
why the clubs were upset about what we
[SPEAKER_05]: were doing and because we hadn't taken
them in from the beginning, we didn't go
[SPEAKER_05]: anyplace with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as I said, I was good friends with
Jim and Carl Lorenzen and I used to brief
[SPEAKER_05]: them, I began at least in the first stages
of this, briefing them on everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: happened each time and I'd bring them the
pictures and show them to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they realized they couldn't do
anything but take what I had because they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't have any way to follow up on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, Carl Lorenzen began to get
the idea that since I was hanging around
[SPEAKER_05]: the APRO office all the time that Lou
Zinstag was really coming to APRO with the
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures and I intercepted her and stole
the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she told me that one time and I had
keys to the office and I worked there for
[SPEAKER_05]: them and everything although I was not a
member of APRO.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she took my keys away, changed the
locks in the office and ordered the people
[SPEAKER_05]: there to not let me in the door anymore
after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that didn't stop my contacts because
Jim Lorenzen was very interested and he
[SPEAKER_05]: used to call me early on Friday morning
and suggest we have breakfast together at
[SPEAKER_05]: the country kitchen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did this almost every other week
and he'd ask me about how the kitchen and
[SPEAKER_05]: the plating case was developing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He even wrote me that statement himself in
his own handwriting that was in the cover
[SPEAKER_05]: of the first pictorial book that Carl
Lorenzen denied that he ever offered and
[SPEAKER_05]: she ordered us to take it out of the book
because it wasn't true, which it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we didn't take it out and she got very
upset over that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why most of the clubs had to
take exception to what I was doing and
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't go along with what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now having examined all of this from a
knowledgeable point of view now with
[SPEAKER_05]: hindsight and with a lot of other reports
on Pleiadian contacts, we can draw some
[SPEAKER_05]: conclusions that seem to be of interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: People wonder how can you tell if the case
is real or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to list 20 points of knowledge
that occur frequently in the Pleiadian
[SPEAKER_05]: contacts with Earth humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you find a half a dozen or more of
these points in a case where the
[SPEAKER_05]: extraterrestrial humans say they come from
the Pleiades, they're probably right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, all of those mentioned here
who claim they came from what we call the
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleiades looked as much human as we do and
were all about our size and stature and
[SPEAKER_05]: build.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, all of them articulated the
language of their contactee speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: fluently of our sciences, history,
and culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all spoke our language, which meant
they either knew it before or that they
[SPEAKER_05]: had acquired it and they knew how to read
our textbooks on the shelf and they knew
[SPEAKER_05]: how to investigate our research and study
live by observing it themselves through
[SPEAKER_05]: their viewing screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all said, this is number three,
they all said that Earth's humanity was
[SPEAKER_05]: descended from their own ancient ancestors
and from whom we had inherited an unusual
[SPEAKER_05]: aggressiveness.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also argued that both our creationist
theory and our evolutionist theory are
[SPEAKER_05]: equally untenable and that we really
should be talking about or thinking about
[SPEAKER_05]: a migrationist theory because we all came
here from some place else.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were brought here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, all of them said that their
ancestors had been here many times before
[SPEAKER_05]: over the ages coming and going as
conditions changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we thought that our history began
4,000 or 5,000 or 6,000 years ago back to
[SPEAKER_05]: our earliest written form or symbol form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's just our modern reemergence
from an other state of society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number five, they all claimed that they
participated in some of the great events
[SPEAKER_05]: of our religious works and our mythology,
sometimes even being adored and worshiped
[SPEAKER_05]: as gods, which they said they were not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they were humans just like us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number six, they all claimed extensive
lifespans at least 10 times what is normal
[SPEAKER_05]: for us now, all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all, this is number seven,
they all without exception deplore our
[SPEAKER_05]: misuse of our sciences today saying that
our mind has outrun our spiritual
[SPEAKER_05]: development and that we have already
prepared the end of our planet and our own
[SPEAKER_05]: species as we know it and that we have
done this before over and over and still
[SPEAKER_05]: have not learned this very important
lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: For this, we are a valuable laboratory
study and many ETs come here from far and
[SPEAKER_05]: wide to observe us and how we might
survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number eight, they all travel faster than
the speed of light as we know it in their
[SPEAKER_05]: interstellar ships.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not plagued by the speed of light
limitations as our science understands it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number nine, there was no conclusive
evidence that any of the groups mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: were in direct contact with any other of
the Pleiadian groups mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all coming here from the Pleiades,
but they're coming at different times and
[SPEAKER_05]: on their own business doing their own
thing and there was no evidence at least
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't mention other Pleiadian groups
visiting here other than to say that there
[SPEAKER_05]: were others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 10, they all mentioned other
inhabited planets in the star group we
[SPEAKER_05]: call the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 11, they all mentioned other
extraterrestrial beings from elsewhere in
[SPEAKER_05]: the universe coming here to observe and
study Earth and its life forms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three mentioned actual contact and willing
cooperation with other ETs of other race
[SPEAKER_05]: types and systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three of them used robotoid, part
mechanical and part organic, created
[SPEAKER_05]: beings in limited operational functions in
their societies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 12, they all used organic computers
that could be controlled telepathically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 13, they all foresaw great changes
in our planet in the near future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 14, none of them had any money as
we know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have any religion as we know
it and they had no competitive political
[SPEAKER_05]: system as we know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 15, three of them had active bases
operating on the surface of our planet and
[SPEAKER_05]: those active bases frequently hosted other
extraterrestrial species types up to eight
[SPEAKER_05]: in a group or up to eight other types for
each of those who were hosting others
[SPEAKER_05]: coming here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 16, they all were capable of under
ocean operations and used our oceans to
[SPEAKER_05]: great advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: The water is no more hostile in deep
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 17, they all used a variety of
different spacecraft in their operations
[SPEAKER_05]: and they all had distinctive styles of
ships and equipment, yet there were many
[SPEAKER_05]: similarities in many respects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 18, three groups that we know of
used very large carrier type motherships
[SPEAKER_05]: in deep space near our solar system while
they were here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't come into the solar system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 19, in each case to the group of
individuals who formed around the
[SPEAKER_05]: contactee, the new contacts and
information was so mind boggling and so
[SPEAKER_05]: profound and so far exceeded their
knowledge of what was going on elsewhere
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world that they carefully guarded
their secret within their own immediate
[SPEAKER_05]: circle for a number of years and then only
confided it to a very few trusted friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 20, and the most important point of
all, up to 1979, none of these groups had
[SPEAKER_05]: ever heard of each other and there was no
cross correspondence between the ones I
[SPEAKER_05]: just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, with that characterization and those
points in mind, I would like to show you
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the pictures taken by Mr. Meyer
and to give you an idea of what is being
[SPEAKER_05]: challenged as a lot of fraudulent
photography and you can judge for yourself
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we'll show you some other
pictures taken by others and let you make
[SPEAKER_05]: your own comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be the decision maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you all probably have heard or many
of you have heard of the program put on
[SPEAKER_05]: by, I think it's Laura Lee or something
like that in the Northwest where they had
[SPEAKER_05]: a popular Pleiades basher by the name of
Cal Corp on the program and he argued a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of things against the Swiss case so we
don't encourage argument.
[SPEAKER_05]: If people have a better explanation,
we are wide open to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should listen to his arguments and see
if they make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do, they're going to be better
than my arguments.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't, you can see through some of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Cal Corp also appeared on the Art Bell
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a lot of listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all tuned in and he was doing the
same thing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, let me tell you who Mr. Cal Corp is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a 16-year-old boy in high school
when he wrote me the first time about two
[SPEAKER_05]: years, three years after I began
investigating the Pleidian case,
[SPEAKER_05]: after he'd read the Saga article and he
wanted some pictures and I sent him 20
[SPEAKER_05]: cold slides that I had made from the
pictures I was working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then he wanted some more pictures and I
sent him more and then he wanted more and
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him that we couldn't send him all
the pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't getting anything in return.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the next exchange of mail, I got a
package of 20 slides from Cal Corp.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wanted to exchange them for more
Pleidian pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I put them in a box and sent him
another cold slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't the best ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones that were poor color,
faded, not a good copy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put his slides aside because I
didn't have time to do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then a friend of Cal Corp, who had seen
the Swiss pictures and knew what Cal was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing, wrote me a letter and said,
do you know that Cal Corp is manufacturing
[SPEAKER_05]: those slides that he's sending you?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's faking them up to see if you can tell
the difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put them in a projector and took a look
at them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the slides were a plastic plate
thrown up on the other side of a house by
[SPEAKER_05]: a Confederate.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it came above the roof line,
Cal Corp would snap it with his camera and
[SPEAKER_05]: had it fall back out of sight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were some that he offered.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had others that were faked in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote him back and told him that I
wasn't going to exchange any more pictures
[SPEAKER_05]: with him, that I wasn't interested in
processing the fakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have any room to keep them in my
files.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got over 3,000 photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly don't need fakes in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing I can do with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: He became a little incensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent the pictures that I had sent him
to Saga Magazine as a photo exclusive,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they published Cal Corp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Corp became angry because we wouldn't
take him into the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another high school teacher in
Wisconsin at the time named Bill Moore,
[SPEAKER_05]: who wrote and wanted us to send him copies
of all the pictures, copies of our contact
[SPEAKER_05]: notes, copies of everything that we had,
photographs that we had taken,
[SPEAKER_05]: so he could analyze them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wrote back and told Bill Moore that we
didn't need anybody else in the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were already having them analyzed by
the best experts we could find and
[SPEAKER_05]: qualified in various fields and
disciplines.
[SPEAKER_05]: He began attacking the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: He became first critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Moore is known for poison pen
writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the ghostwriter for Charles
Berlitz.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Charles Berlitz brought the
Philadelphia Experiment material to Bill
[SPEAKER_05]: Moore to be written up in proper style and
punctuated and prepared for a publisher,
[SPEAKER_05]: it didn't have Bill Moore's name on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Charles Berlitz manuscript.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Moore inserted his name on there as
by Charles Berlitz and William Moore in
[SPEAKER_05]: very small letters on the front cover of
the dust jacket.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next time they published it,
he demanded equal billing and the names
[SPEAKER_05]: were the same size.
[SPEAKER_05]: The third time they published it,
the Philadelphia Experiment was by Bill
[SPEAKER_05]: Moore and Charles Berlitz.
[SPEAKER_05]: That gave you an idea of the kind of
personality Bill Moore had at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's faded from the scene by now having
confessed that he was working for the CIA
[SPEAKER_05]: in the first place, getting paid by them
at least for some things that he was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Moore discovered Cal Corp through his
article in the Saga magazine about the
[SPEAKER_05]: Swiss case and a couple of challenging
remarks that Corp made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Moore wrote up a manuscript attacking
the case from his poison pen hobby point
[SPEAKER_05]: of view and sent it to Cal Corp who put
his name on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was published in a yellow covered
magazine paid for by a man and wife who
[SPEAKER_05]: were also disenchanted about something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called the great Billy Meyer hoax
or something like that and they accused me
[SPEAKER_05]: of perpetrating the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bill Moore and several other people in
agencies used Cal Corp as a mouthpiece
[SPEAKER_05]: because he was still a minor.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was only 17 years old at the time,
couldn't be pursued over slander or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything else so they had him making
slanderous remarks about us and doing a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of things and we failed to rise to the
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't even try to answer about it when
Mufon for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you are Mufon members here and you
remember this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When his first article was published in
the Mufon Journal it occupied three or
[SPEAKER_05]: four pages and so I wrote and you know
when a charge is made it can be a simple
[SPEAKER_05]: one line charge and it takes a half a page
of explanation to explain it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It usually has a foundation in some fact
but it's been distorted.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wrote back about a nine page letter
to Mufon rebuttals to the Cal Corp article
[SPEAKER_05]: and the answer I got from Walt Andrus was
they only give a half a page for
[SPEAKER_05]: rebuttals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't rebut even one of the comments
on a half a page.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all had some merit but they had to be
explained.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we never attempted to rebut any of
those arguments since.
[SPEAKER_05]: You notice we never rose to the challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never argued with anybody and we don't
feel impelled to lay the case on anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't care whether you believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're offering the information that we
know that we have experienced and it's for
[SPEAKER_05]: you to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not important to us and we found that
this was not important to the people in
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't care whether we believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_05]: They let us have access to their
information to do what we wanted to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with it to evaluate it the way we wanted
to and they never tried to persuade us to
[SPEAKER_05]: any point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're not trying to persuade you to
any point of view.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're offering information and that's what
I'm trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm going to show you about a page
of slides here real quick so I can bring
[SPEAKER_05]: on a man here who has been investigating
another new case developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually it's not so new but it's new to
us because we only heard about it a year
[SPEAKER_05]: ago that's developing here in this country
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sort of a continuation of what I was
just describing with respect to the Swiss
[SPEAKER_05]: case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now if you bring up the slides and cut
down the lights please I'll try to
[SPEAKER_05]: describe them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first picture you're going to see here
is the full moon rising over the sand
[SPEAKER_05]: dunes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they need that one for their
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay the first picture you see here is a
full moon rising over the sand dunes at
[SPEAKER_05]: Yuma and I am showing you this because I
want you to remember that that's exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: the size the full moon appears in a slide
film in a positive slide made by an
[SPEAKER_05]: ordinary 35 millimeter camera with a
standard lens spread of 49 millimeters I
[SPEAKER_05]: think it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anything that you see in the pictures
that I'm going to show you that are
[SPEAKER_05]: relatively larger than that will have
appeared to the photographer as being
[SPEAKER_05]: larger than the full moon rising.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's the first one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh this is Mr. Meyer and his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the uniform he is wearing as the
guard at the facility he was guarding.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was he was making his living with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also a watchman at that time for the
railroad and that's his railroad uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is one of the pictures taken in India
at the time he was in the ashram.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's five balls of light in the sky.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was published in the New Delhi
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a number of other pictures
taken in time and that thing goes out the
[SPEAKER_05]: ceiling at the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way to tip it down at all art
or is this what we are going to have to go
[SPEAKER_05]: with?
[SPEAKER_05]: The object image is at the top of the
picture here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture is taken in the Frick Nature
Preserve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now remember if this appears larger than
the apparent size of the full moon you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to see that the apparent size of the
photographer it looks about four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: times as big right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So to the photographer taking the picture
that would have appeared to be four or
[SPEAKER_05]: five times as large as the full moon
rising.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay thank you Art.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another picture in the Frick
Nature Preserve here number two.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hovering over a tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually that's about number five just
before it departed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I put in here on that
particular case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a series of four pictures taken
over Jacobsburg, Allenburg, Switzerland on
[SPEAKER_05]: 27th of February.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just one month later at 10 o'clock
in the morning and there are four ships in
[SPEAKER_05]: formation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two remote drones being
controlled by the two motherships the
[SPEAKER_05]: lower ships of the motherships.
[SPEAKER_05]: About seven meters that's about 21 feet in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_05]: The drones are about four meters or 12
feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the four ships wheeling around and
coming back overhead here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see some of the bottom detail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were accused early on when they hadn't
released this picture yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the pictures seem to have dark bottoms
so what the arguments offered was that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're all fakes, that they're all models
because the bottoms are black.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well you can see the bottoms are not
black.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see detail on all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture taken of those four
crafts and there's two out of the scene at
[SPEAKER_05]: the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go by them quick because we want to
bring the other gentleman on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now remember if that's bigger than the
apparent size of the rising moon in the
[SPEAKER_05]: picture we saw that was that much bigger
to the photographer when he took these
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Jacobsburg, Allenburg again 27th
of February.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is an interesting picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to tip that down because we
can see enough of it but you see the rays
[SPEAKER_05]: being reflected from the dome of the craft
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are called crepuscular rays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crepuscular rays are like a rainbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're formed at a distance from the
observer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can never get up to a crepuscular ray
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can catch up to a rainbow.
[SPEAKER_05]: This means this is one of the points
demonstrating that this is not a model
[SPEAKER_05]: close to the camera because it has to be a
certain distance away before the
[SPEAKER_05]: crepuscular rays can even be seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we put this one in here for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture taken in the same
series to show you what it looks like up
[SPEAKER_05]: close when it's so close that it's
obscuring the sky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now remember if that's bigger than the
size of the rising moon that's how much
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger it was in apparent size to the
photographer at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to back up to that one I just
had here because I think my friend Randy
[SPEAKER_05]: Winters has a picture similar to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to show you where his craft is
doing something very interesting and I
[SPEAKER_05]: want you to remember this one just for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll mention it again when he comes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here are two craft a 21 foot diameter
mothership or shepherd ship controlling a
[SPEAKER_05]: remote control craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case the remote craft had a safety
seat for a single pilot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could be flown by one pilot aboard or
they could be flown under remote control.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 21 foot diameter craft had two pilot
positions aboard seat positions aboard and
[SPEAKER_05]: a third jump position where they could
carry a pilot or another person aboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not very big.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ships really are not large in size.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are close to the camera because they
and their apparent size is large because
[SPEAKER_05]: they are close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is another picture following the one
just before we go back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can see it going overhead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It appears to be higher in the sky only
because it's closer to the cameraman and
[SPEAKER_05]: as they move away they appear to descend
to the horizon only because they're going
[SPEAKER_05]: away from him and appear to be going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an optical illusion.
[SPEAKER_05]: This next series of pictures and there's
several in here was taken at Oberseidelig,
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland on 8 March 1975.
[SPEAKER_05]: The object was seen coming up the hazy
valley there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Slowly and his first picture was taken
over the log pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took about 13 or 14 pictures in series.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it's running to his left over the
tops of birch trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are tall birch trees growing down
the hill from where Meyer is standing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not bushes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a second following picture in that
series and it moved along beyond the
[SPEAKER_05]: incinerator here to curve around a stand
of tall pine trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you can see again that that's about
four times the visual diameter of the
[SPEAKER_05]: rising moon so it's quite large to him
visually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not that far away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about 280 meters as a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it's further back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about 300 meters, 320 meters away I
think we measured for this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's turned and it's following the stand
of pine trees there coming to the left and
[SPEAKER_05]: here it's going around the end of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is a bit of an enlargement here
to get to see some detail in it so in
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective it would have been about half
that size.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it is going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last picture in that series.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another series that was
photographed over Winkle Ratt,
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland on the 18th of March 1975 at 9
o'clock in the morning under a heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: cloudy overcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: The object was flying under the clouds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It flew back and forth over an area there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The building that you see over here in the
side is a sanitarium of some kind for ill
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that it's shown edge on,
tilted, both directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's a lot more in each of these
series.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just showing you some examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the series taken over
Berg-Rumlikon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Berg-Rumlikon means it's between the
little town of Berg and the little town of
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumlikon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some place in between over the countryside
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 June 1975.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was invited to this photographic event.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was often told when to bring his camera
because if he wasn't told that he could
[SPEAKER_05]: take pictures that he brought to camera,
they wouldn't give him an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_05]: take them anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they were going to pose the ship
for pictures, they invited him to bring
[SPEAKER_05]: his cameras and in this case he took two
35mm hand cameras and an 8mm movie camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: A keywound 8mm movie camera, set the movie
camera on a tripod, turned it on
[SPEAKER_05]: automatic, took his hand camera and waited
for him to appear and it appeared just
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, came right out of the distance,
rapidly approaching, making S-turns coming
[SPEAKER_05]: up to the camera and he simultaneously
filmed this picture, these pictures on 8mm
[SPEAKER_05]: film as well as 35mm slides, positive
slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: This picture was taken near the same area
at a time when they brought three ships
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them hovered in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: One landed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the third seat empty.
[SPEAKER_05]: They invited Meyer to go with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first two ships have taken off now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The high one there is number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's number two and he's in the third
one and they're just leaving the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a second picture taken when they
were about 1,000 feet in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see the ground very well but
it's down here in the haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a good picture you can see buildings on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that they are in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a series of pictures that we have
never released anywhere before and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing them for the first time taken over
back to Hornley on the 28th of March 1979.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1976 where he is using the tripod as a
foreground reference.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had been telling him craft in the sky
don't mean a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing around him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't tell how far away they are,
how big they are or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get foreground, get background,
get objects alongside them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's trying to get the legs of his tripod
in the foreground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Later he tries to get bushes and things
like that in the foreground.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a series you're seeing for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably have four or five of them in
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here he's shooting through the legs of his
tripod.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it's apparently to the left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's moving around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The craft is moving slowly and he's moving
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to sit down with these
pictures and do some geometry you can find
[SPEAKER_05]: about how much the craft is moving and
about how far away by how he's changing
[SPEAKER_05]: position around the tripod.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture in the series.
[SPEAKER_05]: On that day he had two photographic
events, one in the morning and one in the
[SPEAKER_05]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: This picture was taken over back to
Hornley also, same day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to notice the detail under the
ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the 35 millimeter slide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture in that series.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if I can do something with the
focus here.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to look carefully at the amount
of detail you can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see some trees, a tree line under
the craft and a little point of trees that
[SPEAKER_05]: rises above the horizon line.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a notch there in the top of the
hill where there are no trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't see much in it now, can you?
[SPEAKER_05]: We took this picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was one of the clearer pictures they
took because there was very little motion
[SPEAKER_05]: in the camera and very little motion on
the ship and we got nice sharp edges.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took it to a graphics processing shop
in Basel where they had a Helchromograph
[SPEAKER_05]: 300 laser scanner, an Argon laser scanner.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put it through the scanner and
created four color separation negatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amber, cyan, and red negatives and a black
and white negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took those negatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the negatives made, poster size.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took them to a poster printer and had
them printed on poster paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now remember what you're seeing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the detail that came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how much it improved the picture by
just laser scanning it and printing it
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first time we saw detail like
that in any craft anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good process for testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We stumbled onto it accidentally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know how it was going to come
out when we started.
[SPEAKER_05]: This next one was photographed over
Haassenboll and you see that he is doing
[SPEAKER_05]: what we said.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is getting some foreground in his
pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's moving to the right as the craft is
moving to his right also.
[SPEAKER_05]: He keeps bringing bushes between him and
the approaching craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's descending to a position behind a
bare limb tree there where it's hovering
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you look closely you can see
some crepuscular rays on that craft there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see them just below the rim flange
shining down a kind of a V of rays like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are also crepuscular rays from the
sun reflecting off the dome of the craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can only be perceived at a distance,
eliminating the possibility of that being
[SPEAKER_05]: a monster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a picture in that series after the
contact.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a contact on the ground with the
craft hovering beyond the tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they boarded the craft and left he
took pictures of the departing craft as it
[SPEAKER_05]: circled out over the valley, came back
around, and then ascended vertically
[SPEAKER_05]: overhead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a series of pictures taken at
Schmarbühl where the Swiss Army was
[SPEAKER_05]: holding army maneuvers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big army maneuver.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had aircraft, they had tanks,
they had infantry forces, they had
[SPEAKER_05]: paratroops, everything there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Swiss are always on some kind of an
exercise but this was one of their bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in the middle of the exercise Meyer
was summoned to a contact in the middle of
[SPEAKER_05]: the exercise area.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to go across fields and around
ditches to miss the checkpoints to get to
[SPEAKER_05]: the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he got there the Pleiadian craft
approached from beyond the ridge line.
[SPEAKER_05]: The army is on the other side of the ridge
at this present time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unknown to him they're watching this on
their radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it coming through the smoke
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: As it gets closer you can barely see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it came up at an angle overhead.
[SPEAKER_05]: He turned on a tape recorder he was
carrying with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He began recording the sounds that he was
hearing from the spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't always hear sounds but this time
it was making a sound.
[SPEAKER_05]: He began recording the sounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a half hour tape in his record.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just let it run.
[SPEAKER_05]: And took pictures as that Swiss army
mirage now vectored in by the radar made
[SPEAKER_05]: 22 passes on the alien vehicle in the sky
at low level around him there.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 22nd pass the mirage broke off
contact and went back to its base and
[SPEAKER_05]: landed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We learned from a mechanic at the base
that the mirage returned with a story of
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to intercept it to get gun camera
pictures of a ship and as soon as he armed
[SPEAKER_05]: the fire control system which also arms
the gun camera so he could take the
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures the electronic system began to
smoke and melted down in the cockpit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all had to be changed out at a very
great expense to the Swiss army.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while this was going on and while it's
making passes Meyer was observed on the
[SPEAKER_05]: hillside with his camera and his tape
recorder and his moped and they sent a
[SPEAKER_05]: police car to find out what he was doing
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The police car provincial police car drove
up two policemen got out started walking
[SPEAKER_05]: towards Meyer the craft hovering overhead
there and started asking what he was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pointed up they looked up and then the
craft that was already making a humming
[SPEAKER_05]: sound turned on a real loud humming
whining sound that was ear piercing
[SPEAKER_05]: screeching and the cops ran back jumped in
the car put it in the gear and raced off
[SPEAKER_05]: in a cloud of dust and never came back.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this is recorded on the tape.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we took the tape when we took that
tape to the Naval Sound Research
[SPEAKER_05]: Laboratory Groton Connecticut for analysis
they identified the make or the model of
[SPEAKER_05]: the airplane.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also identified the sounds of a
Yonkers J-252 German transport plane
[SPEAKER_05]: dropping paratroopers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They identified the sounds of Pilatus
Porter observation airplane flying
[SPEAKER_05]: overhead.
[SPEAKER_05]: They recorded the sounds of the police car
coming with a siren on before it entered
[SPEAKER_05]: the scene there getting keeping its
clearance in traffic as it raced in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They recorded the sounds of a European
train all these things they found in the
[SPEAKER_05]: sound bank and they could tell us which
train they could tell us the make of the
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a car that it was everything but
they couldn't tell us what was the source
[SPEAKER_05]: of the sound from the spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no match in the sound bank from
buzz saws to anything that they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't get a match for the sounds
being made by the spacecraft that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the part of Switzerland in the red
oval there where much of this is taking
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is a Pleiades star group.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they look like when we see
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: How close are we, Randy?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got?
Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how close are we now?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many minutes are we into this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to run through real quick
through these slides and not bother.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the disk of Phaistos and it's a
story in linear A on an ancient artifact
[SPEAKER_05]: from Crete.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousands of years old describing from the
center out if you can see it
[SPEAKER_05]: in several mythologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we see it on the tomb at Palenque in
Mexico a Mexican figure of a man riding a
[SPEAKER_05]: rocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the plains of Ica, Peru where a
speaker just before me here showed you
[SPEAKER_05]: some scenes from the stones of Ica.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the plains of Nazca right
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plains of Nazca are just to the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here in the desert is where those
stones found by Dr. Cabrera are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's what the stones look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a hemisphere of a planet probably
ours on the cover of Cabrera's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: What this shows is metallic birds with men
riding on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means airborne vehicles of some kind
with men in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And notice that they're using tubes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means extended vision, viewing
screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: The little Aborigines, you see one down
here riding in the back of a dinosaur
[SPEAKER_05]: there, little squat round men that wore
knee length grass skirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: The visitors were dressed in elaborate
body fitting costumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is one of the stones carved with
astronomical figures that shows a probable
[SPEAKER_05]: origin for the people coming here from the
stars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this indicates that they're coming
here from the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a book written by JJ Benitez,
Does Another Humanity Exist, describing,
[SPEAKER_05]: a full book describing the stones of Ica
and the interpretations made by Dr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cabrera and others that they are probably
coming here from the Pleiades and had been
[SPEAKER_05]: coming here since the time of the
dinosaurs that observed indigenous earth
[SPEAKER_05]: humanity living in harmony with the
dinosaurs, even domesticated some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a painting made by Peter the
Frenchman, Piero de la Francesca showing
[SPEAKER_05]: disc shaped objects in the sky during a
religious event.
[SPEAKER_05]: He painted 12 stations across for the
church at Arizo, Italy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in five of those stations across these
dome disc clouds appeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a painting taken from a famous
church in Italy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I got it on my card here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where if you notice in the painting,
in the box up in the upper right hand
[SPEAKER_05]: corner, there's a shepherd with his dog
looking at a bright object in the sky
[SPEAKER_05]: behind the Virgin's head.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Madonna and Saint John.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's the object down here in that
enlargement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's clearly a structured object radiating
a great amount of light painted into that
[SPEAKER_05]: religious picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very famous painting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hangs at a big church in a shrine in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a place, St. Cloud, Minnesota,
where one of the contacts with Mr. Lloyd
[SPEAKER_05]: Zerbes, also being carried out by human
beings from the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't even discuss that before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the cases that came to my
attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I spent a lot of time with Mr.
Zerbes on that case.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those points, 20 points that I
mentioned fit the case, including curing
[SPEAKER_05]: his son of an incurable disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a book written by Delamar Duveris
on the contacts, his contacts with
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleiadians called The Golden Read.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned that such a book existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in the circle there is a place east
of Bogota where Enrique Castillo Rincon,
[SPEAKER_05]: an attorney from Bogota, was led to the
first rendezvous with the human beings
[SPEAKER_05]: that told him that they came from the
Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is what that ship looked like,
the one that Enrique Castillo Rincon was
[SPEAKER_05]: taken to.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was picked up by a smaller shuttle ship
and taken to a larger craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smaller shuttle ship was operated by
human-like beings, little humanoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the environmental gear worn by the
humans aboard the spacecraft when they
[SPEAKER_05]: came to the surface of the planet for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when they got aboard the ship,
they took the suits off and this is how
[SPEAKER_05]: they were dressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wore shoulder-length, light hair,
had light eyes, light-colored eyes,
[SPEAKER_05]: one-piece body-fitting suits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the Pleiadians outside of the
environmental gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a star map they brought up on a
screen to show him exactly where they came
[SPEAKER_05]: from in the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't make any sense to him,
but he was allowed to trace it on a piece
[SPEAKER_05]: of paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the little dark spot in the lower
right-hand corner is the position of our
[SPEAKER_05]: son on that screen display.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a picture taken in Bogota,
Colombia by two young boys that one of
[SPEAKER_05]: them had gotten a camera for for a
birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're taking this at the time that
Enrique Castillo Rincon was picked up by a
[SPEAKER_05]: small shuttle craft and taken to the
mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll show you, it's up here in the
right-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a shuttlecock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a silvery white flange with a
reddish dome on the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture of the same craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it a little better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's high in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the rosy dome there and the
silvery white flange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is the thing that's moved around
to the sky into a silhouette position.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is where Juan Kyle Peru is where
Charles Silva was having his contacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Charles Silva was the man Shirley MacLean
called David in her book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ramatis is the woman that Shirley MacLean
called Rama in her book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those contacts were going on at the
same time as investigating the case in
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Charles Silva's book, A Date with
the Gods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is the place, you can see Tocuyo in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: El Tocuyo, that's the place in Venezuela
where the contacts were taking place in
[SPEAKER_05]: the sugar cane field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these contacts, as they began and
developed, the word got out around the
[SPEAKER_05]: countryside and cars came from everywhere
until they had as many as hundreds of cars
[SPEAKER_05]: blocking the roads to the cane fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd get in there so densely crowded
and jammed in that the police would have
[SPEAKER_05]: to come and unscramble the cars from the
outside in to get them all out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happened a number of times and we
interviewed police that were involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: that particular operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They even reported seeing the objects
performing over the cane fields
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I'm showing you a gulf breeze here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You all know where it is just off the
coast of Pensacola because when I spent
[SPEAKER_05]: some time with Ed Walters and his wife,
Francie, in a condo one time in Orlando
[SPEAKER_05]: where we were doing a weak thing like
this, Ed told me that the controllers of
[SPEAKER_05]: the little robot beings that he saw told
him they came from the Pleiades and that
[SPEAKER_05]: when he was aboard the mothership,
the dish shaped craft that controlled the
[SPEAKER_05]: little robotoids, he said that they were
humans just like us and for that reason he
[SPEAKER_05]: was very interested in what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the book that Ed wrote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he didn't say in this one but in
the next one here he described,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he mentioned one time that the
beings aboard the ship told him they came
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went into some detail with it with me
because he was interested in the Pleiades
[SPEAKER_05]: case.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the little robotoids that
operated the shuttlecraft that picked Ed
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also the creature that he saw on
the porch of his, the veranda of his home
[SPEAKER_05]: in Gulf Breeze, Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the area of Buenos Aires where,
forgotten his name, the man from Argentina
[SPEAKER_05]: was having his contact with the Pleiadian
humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I do just a couple of slides here,
Randy?
[SPEAKER_05]: While you change the carousel back there,
let me tell you that a time came in the
[SPEAKER_05]: discussions that Mr. Meyer had with the
Pleiadians and Randy, when he was living
[SPEAKER_05]: there with them, Randy had long
discussions with Meyer hours and hours
[SPEAKER_05]: into the night and so I'm sure that this
came up in his discussions with him too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the German militarists were frequently
mentioned and at some point in the
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion with Ta, the Pleiadian man,
he said something about, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: just hold that there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said something about that the Germans
were developing this shaped craft during
[SPEAKER_05]: the war and that they had succeeded in
developing operational vehicles that had
[SPEAKER_05]: to be evacuated before Germany collapsed
and that they were taken elsewhere and
[SPEAKER_05]: suggested that Ta said that some went to
Antarctica and some went to the Amazon and
[SPEAKER_05]: a number of other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't pay much attention to that at
the time because everybody knew that they
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't in the Amazon jungles until we
started doing some research on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a man in the audience here that
has done a lot of research on this and has
[SPEAKER_05]: come up with a lot of information and with
his kind permission, I'm gonna show you
[SPEAKER_05]: several pictures here that show how far
the German research got before it was
[SPEAKER_05]: evacuated.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the white corridor escape plan
that was allowed as Germany was falling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that somebody has marked the
positions of nine Saturn-shaped disks on
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the locations of research
facilities controlled by the German SS.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the responsible authority for
the V7 weapons research program in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: and they successfully evacuated seven of
them and destroyed two before the
[SPEAKER_05]: Americans captured.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one of the research vehicles though
that the Germans produced and it certainly
[SPEAKER_05]: is a disk shaped craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an early one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two, when the war was winding
down and we were overrunning the German
[SPEAKER_05]: territory, we had a sector, the French had
a sector, the Australians had some,
[SPEAKER_05]: the English had some and whoever captured
a factory went in with trucks and hauled
[SPEAKER_05]: off all the factory's documents,
sent them back here to the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: so we could figure out what they were
doing and see what we could learn from
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In those documents, it took years to sift
through all the documents but in the
[SPEAKER_05]: documents, the Australians found a 16
millimeter video documentary prepared by
[SPEAKER_05]: German technicians describing or outlining
their research program and they published
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Trudewski encountered a copy and he
has told us about it for a number of years
[SPEAKER_05]: but after Mr. Trudewski's release here and
the Australian release down there,
[SPEAKER_05]: the KGB started searching their files,
they came up with another one made by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Germans also and you can tell which ones
are from the Russian film because they
[SPEAKER_05]: have the time code on the right-hand side
when they were transferred to videotape
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Australian film does not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is from the Russian captured film
footage.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the film footage captured by
the Australians and here you see a large
[SPEAKER_05]: craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a disc-shaped craft with a dome on
the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you see a truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big German truck and there's a
gantry crane on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft so you can see that this is probably
around 100 feet in diameter there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could see it better, there are three
men working under the craft almost
[SPEAKER_05]: standing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one of that type in flight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is from the Russian film.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can see that there are some
appendages underneath there's some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: structure on the bottom that they're
working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another version.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a version where the Germans have
mounted a tank turret inverted on the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottom of the craft trying to give it some
cannon power, firepower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a view from the bottom of the
craft, the German craft directly overhead.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the German insignia on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another view of the one with the
tank cannon pod mounted underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one in flight in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are from the Russian film.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a drawing from the German files.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also shows the German insignia on the
side of the craft there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a large craft intended to be
hundreds of feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was supposed to be 300 feet
in diameter and this was being considered
[SPEAKER_05]: as a Mars expeditionary craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is back in the 40s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a German suggestion for a flying
dreadnought disk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another expanded version of that
and here's one that reached some
[SPEAKER_05]: considerable design sophistication where
they have located facilities and equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: aboard the craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see notice the SS symbol on the top
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a paper that I am told by some people
that it's hoaxed but it came from
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia along with the film and I don't
know how much hoaxing there's done to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the writing is in German.
[SPEAKER_05]: The craft is quite similar to the one that
was photographed by George Adamski back in
[SPEAKER_05]: 1953 and this was allegedly evacuated from
Germany sometime in the 40s, the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: 40s, 1943 or 44 and taken someplace else
for development.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one that Mr. Adamski happened to
photograph.
[SPEAKER_05]: Notice the similarity between the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture taken over England
at Coniston Moors by two young boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight, seven and eight years or I believe
six and eight years old with a pinhole
[SPEAKER_05]: camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't even have a lens in it but it's
similar in shape and when those are
[SPEAKER_05]: projected together by Leonard Cramp in
England he got similar profiles suggesting
[SPEAKER_05]: that Adamski and the boys in England
photographed the same or very similar
[SPEAKER_05]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a schematic of a proposed German
mothership that would carry one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: large Hanabu type craft and three of the
smaller Vril type craft aboard the
[SPEAKER_05]: mothership and here's a picture of a
mothership in flight over Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another picture taken by George
Adamski of what he considered called the
[SPEAKER_05]: mothership in his contacts and if you'll
notice those little blobs of light,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you look closely at the middle one
there you'll notice that it's made up of
[SPEAKER_05]: spots of light.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just a blob of light,
it's bright spots of light, a bar of
[SPEAKER_05]: bright spots of light with a curve on the
top and a curve on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is a craft that was photographed,
this is probably not extraterrestrial,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a vehicle photographed over South
Africa which is just off the coast of
[SPEAKER_05]: Antarctica, New Schwabenland in
Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a piece of Antarctica claimed by the
Germans and staked out by them and they
[SPEAKER_05]: have a fairly large facility down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a picture taken over Queensland,
Australia by Mr. Hall of what looks like a
[SPEAKER_05]: jungle hat shaped craft with three
hemispheres under the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite similar to another drawing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here's, notice the shape of this
drawing with the reverse curve in the
[SPEAKER_05]: upper dome and here's a photograph taken
over Italy of three craft in formation
[SPEAKER_05]: with the very same shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one has to wonder a little bit about
where these shapes are coming from and how
[SPEAKER_05]: much of this fits together and with that
and that slight introduction I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring Randy on because he is investigating
a case in Miami that involves all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Including the German connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, Randy are you ready down
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show you today, we may be
full circle on really unraveling the
[SPEAKER_02]: mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has always been believed by most all of
us who have known about the Meyer case,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly back in the early 80's that
we were given what we were told,
[SPEAKER_02]: that someone was coming from the Pleiades,
they probably were our ancient ancestors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know any different than that and
we had no reason to really suspect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendel is just giving you some information
about the development of the German
[SPEAKER_02]: situation back in the 20's and 30's
because now 20 years later the answers are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to come out in kind of full
circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got involved in the case quite a little
bit differently than Wendel.
[SPEAKER_02]: My interest was really in kind of the
spiritual and historical information and
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first heard about the Pleiade in
case over at Myers I said well you know if
[SPEAKER_02]: human life is really coming from some
place else and is that advanced imagine
[SPEAKER_02]: what we could learn from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a few hundred questions I wanted
to know about you know life and creation
[SPEAKER_02]: of the universe and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I eventually found my way over to Myers
house and wound up painting the bar and
[SPEAKER_02]: taking care of the chickens and all that
and living there for a long period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I spent a lot of time with Billy,
I had him all to myself for about four
[SPEAKER_02]: months just he and I hanging out every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I drained his brain pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did that I got together a
collection of all of his information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out that his contacts had gone
on for about three years on a weekly
[SPEAKER_02]: basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had 115 contacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had over 2,000 pages of his own
personal notes that he had taken of all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these conversations which he turned over
to me and we went all through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eventually put those into a book called
The Pleiadian Mission which some of you
[SPEAKER_02]: may know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it here with me if you'd like to
get a copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My interest was trying to put this
connection together with who we are on
[SPEAKER_02]: this earth and if someone is coming from
another world and they're saying our
[SPEAKER_02]: ancestors is that true is there really a
connection here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pleiadian material tells us that our
forefathers were their forefathers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That human life from the Pleiades has been
coming here a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That their forefathers were from a place
called Lyra.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they descended from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the seed of human life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I studied all this information and I
was traveling about a year ago down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida giving a talk on this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually it was at the request of a
young lady in Florida asked me to come
[SPEAKER_02]: down to speak to her group which spoke
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had an interesting afternoon being
translated and speaking very slowly and
[SPEAKER_02]: explaining myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the talk a young
man came up to me and introduced himself
[SPEAKER_02]: and told me his name was Audrey Ame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says do you remember an evening
about six years ago when you were living
[SPEAKER_02]: at Billy Myers' house and you were hearing
voices in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of yeah I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've told a few people that so that
didn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says you heard your name called out
and then you got up went over and answered
[SPEAKER_02]: the door to see who was there didn't you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I says yeah as a matter of fact I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've told that to a few people too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was getting intrigued with how we
would know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says well after you looked up
and down the hall then it occurred to you
[SPEAKER_02]: that somebody might be trying to send you
something and you laid down on the bed and
[SPEAKER_02]: listened to the thoughts that came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those next thoughts told you to study
here learn what you can but don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the situation and move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I says yeah I never told anybody that
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you didn't listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead you got involved and stayed there
anyway didn't you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says I was on board a craft over the
top of the house that night when the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleiadians were sending you that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been having contacts with them for 29
years and they told me in six years they
[SPEAKER_02]: would start contacts in America to
continue the process that they started in
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they were going to do that that
you would be the person that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: contact with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about that time my mind was kind of you
know getting a little unraveled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thought that hit me was if
someone's been reading my thoughts and
[SPEAKER_02]: putting them in their head for all these
years that they still wanted to talk to me
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of amazed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we usually try to keep most of our
thoughts you know to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate he says I know you're
going to want some validation of this and
[SPEAKER_02]: some proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever you're ready you could start the
high eight camera and just kind of let it
[SPEAKER_02]: roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: As validation of what he was talking about
he says my contacts have been going on for
[SPEAKER_02]: about 29 years but they're quite different
than the Meyer situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meyer was chosen as a contact person at
birth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says I was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says I am a Pleiadian soul transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are about 20 of us on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way I'm going to let this tape run.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tape I made down at his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where he lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a photo book of pictures he's been
shooting for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see a lot of similarity in the
craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the remote disk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that he hangs out with them
because he's family.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has no interest in being a contact
person but they had asked him to do it to
[SPEAKER_02]: start getting new information and new
photos out into the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is by the way is one of the kind of
pie pan remote disk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to the one that Wendell
just showed you over Meyer's home.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says those are very common down over
Mexico City that they have quite a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: them stationed down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a beam ship type one of those 21
footers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the little antenna on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 21 feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can carry three people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has interdimensional capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: This picture was taken from inside a
craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it for a second you'll
notice that you're in the clouds kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: looking down at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one we have the original negative on
it and has just been analyzed and given a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good clean bill of health.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is taken through his screen door.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a very busy patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Miami in the middle of the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on his patio most of these pictures
are taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a large screen door there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one he took very quickly through
the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he's in the craft again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look at the top left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably hard to see but there's a
green line up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a mother ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we would call a mother ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time we've seen anything
cylinder in reference to the Pleiadian
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's green and has kind of a bright
red flare right around the middle of it
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's a little hard to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just several disks over some
treetops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him why his, what were the
Pleiadians going to try to make known
[SPEAKER_02]: through him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me that they wanted to continue
the situation that they had started with
[SPEAKER_02]: Meyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell showed you an overhead picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one that he was making
reference to.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes most of these pictures with a
Polaroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look at the clouds right through the
hull of the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he took the picture it took a 30th of
a second to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craft was disappearing,
dematerializing as he took the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the shot it was in kind of in
various stages of being invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the clouds right through
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he's on board the craft he says you
can't tell anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this is happening they power up the
field around the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by so doing it distorts reflected
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craft could be floating right over
your head and your eyes cannot see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can be sitting there checking you
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: These next two or three shots are at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had asked him after I met him if he
could get some video for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He obliged.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got him a video camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones you're looking at right now,
these are still shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took some Polaroids at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let this run just here for a
few minutes while I explain the things to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him about, notice this Polaroid
here because a little later there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: video of this same action and you'll kind
of want to remember this shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrienne told me that there was a very
unusual situation going on here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That years ago, in connection with what
Wendell was telling you about,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the late 20s and 30s that there were
several old spirits born into the German
[SPEAKER_02]: plane that were of leering descent who
were far older than most of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of their vast knowledge,
their spiritual knowledge from previous
[SPEAKER_02]: lives, it was a fairly easy matter for
them to get onto the idea of building
[SPEAKER_02]: these disks.
[SPEAKER_02]: With very little help, they were able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had disks flying, he said,
in the early 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't flying very well,
but they were also making connection with
[SPEAKER_02]: the ETs who were watching them.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time World War II came along,
the Pleiadians and other races saw what
[SPEAKER_02]: was happening in the German situation and
did not want the technology involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: World War II to throw the balance of power
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they invited several German families,
Italian families, and English families who
[SPEAKER_02]: were involved in the development of this
technology to leave that situation and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring their families and kids with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they brought them to a station that
Adrienne calls the Space City down in
[SPEAKER_02]: South America somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that's the ground the morning
after the craft was there where the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground's all burnt up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought these people down to South
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they had them down there,
they weren't too sure what to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a couple hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they offered to educate them and seize
the opportunity to start educating people
[SPEAKER_02]: from Earth about what life is like on
other planets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrienne told me that he frequently goes
back to the home planets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's shown me pictures of the home
planets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's shown me pictures of the Space City
in South America, which we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get some copies of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tells me that there are communities
now on a Pleiadian world with Earth people
[SPEAKER_02]: living there, with their families,
learning and studying from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He believes there's approximately a
20-year program going on where these
[SPEAKER_02]: people may start returning to help out the
situation here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He feels that it's his mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taking it on personally to start
finding other people that might want to
[SPEAKER_02]: start coming in connection with the
Pleiadians themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's teaching his own method of
meditation and helping people find their
[SPEAKER_02]: own mantras.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Adrienne.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look closely at the bottom of the
picture, this is last Thanksgiving Day,
[SPEAKER_02]: a year ago, in 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are his Pleiadian parents coming to
pick him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: His girlfriend is with him and is taking
the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the top, you can see the
craft coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also four or five other craft in
the area in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little hard to see, I know,
in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: They picked him up and picked up his
girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gets to go on all the rides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky girl in the Meier case, his wife
Poppy never got to go anywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she gets to go along.
[SPEAKER_02]: She takes most of the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hung out for that afternoon,
she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked her if she'd been on other trips
with him, and she says, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to go all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, I don't ask many questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sit in the craft and be quiet,
but she takes most of the photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little hard to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four or five disks over his
apartment building there, and I can't see
[SPEAKER_02]: them from over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now check, these are six disks that are
just beginning to materialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is off his patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a common thing for him to stand on
the patio, which you'll see next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take notes, they send him telepathic
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he is standing on the patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice the disk in formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, he didn't even notice they were
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: His girlfriend grabbed the picture while
he's taking his notes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the very next picture, a helicopter
flies in.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the helicopter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flies over the apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look at the first three disks.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they see the helicopter, they begin to
power up the field and dematerialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the camera caught him just in various
stages there of dematerializing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Art, is there any chance we could hit the
rewind and kind of let him see that last
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds again?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is his spot out on the patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can let go anywhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He spends a lot of time on the patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, they talk to him all the time in
his head, and he writes down all of his
[SPEAKER_02]: notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't hear a voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets a stream of visions, like watching
a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he has to translate it, and then
later they come and he cleans up his
[SPEAKER_02]: notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Art, if you don't mind, doing that one
more time back to the same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you, excuse me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't know how good it pauses,
but I wanted to stop on that one if I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now take a close look at this picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell just showed you some disks that
look almost exactly like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: The original, what's called Vril
levitation design that was designed by
[SPEAKER_02]: these Germans back in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're looking at are nine Vril craft
made in South America by Earth people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are learning from the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not Pleiadian craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next picture with the helicopter is
also made here in South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been to the Space City,
and when he will let me have them,
[SPEAKER_02]: he has a nice group of beautiful photos
walking around down there with disks
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he got down there, he had his
Polaroid with him, and they told him they
[SPEAKER_02]: were going to be there for a while and let
him hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got out of the craft with his Polaroid
and turned around and he was very
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised because he had not been there
before, but he said it looked like an
[SPEAKER_02]: airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were rows of disks sitting on the
ground parked all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are Zeta disks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zetas are down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are Pleiadian, very large Pleiadian
disks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole score of German Vril
craft, even some old Honobus down there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and pretty much all the craft that we've
seen throughout the Meyer case are all
[SPEAKER_02]: parked down there also.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was about 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In his photo book, if he'll let me have
them, which I'll get them yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sitting right on the ground with
people working on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he's concerned about is he says that
when people begin to find out that a
[SPEAKER_02]: select group of people from Europe have
had some extra privileges over the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 40 years, they've gone to other
worlds, they've had children on other
[SPEAKER_02]: worlds, they no longer speak German,
Italian, or English, they've learned on a
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleiadian world, and now they're coming
back here to help their own planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having contacts with people all
over the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they say they're from the
Pleiades, sometimes they say from
[SPEAKER_02]: Andromeda, sometimes they say they're from
Orion, but it's all pretty much coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from the same source, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to help people out all over
the planet by raising our consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very aware that in the near
future we have some very difficult times
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel if they were to come out and
say, our parents were Germans,
[SPEAKER_02]: that no one's gonna pay much attention,
and the huge amount of prejudice and hate
[SPEAKER_02]: we still have on the planet would distort
anything that we might learn from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more and more we're going to find
out in the near future about the contacts
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crafts are starting to look the same,
the message is starting to be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, there's over 100,000
people right now from Earth and their
[SPEAKER_02]: descendants living on Pleiadian planets
learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the people that are starting to
come back here over the next few years
[SPEAKER_02]: that are probably going to make a major
difference in the way our civilization
[SPEAKER_02]: goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Art, let her go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you watch this one closely as the
camera goes by, two pictures down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see one of those honeyboos that
Wendell was talking about that was just
[SPEAKER_02]: taken a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought they were extinct, but they're
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at the bottom, see them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try it one more time,
Art?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it has a, you can freeze there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at the bottom right, we'll try it
one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wham.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a German honeyboo parked at the
Space City that's about 30, 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built them to last, and you can see
two men servicing them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has probably 30, 40 pictures in this
caliber walking around down at the Space
[SPEAKER_02]: City of all different types of craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a serious connection going on
between different people on our planet and
[SPEAKER_02]: the extraterrestrials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Art, let her go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Audrey Ain has a special study group that
he's starting now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He feels that the way that he could
possibly be a benefit here was to find
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people that he thinks are ready
and guide them through meditation in their
[SPEAKER_02]: own awareness and help them find
themselves spiritually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the people that are,
most of the people anyway, that are making
[SPEAKER_02]: the connections with them are people that
through meditation learn to get into a
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced state with clear thought so they
can receive information from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another shot where the craft is
just dematerializing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, he shot a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Polaroids with a little cheap 1995
sure-shot camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a 30th of a second plastic lens
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like in the Meyer case, we have a man
here getting the shots of a lifetime,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's taking them with a very
inexpensive camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've purchased him a new 35 millimeter
zoom, autofocus, auto-line, and a case of
[SPEAKER_02]: film.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully he will start getting some
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just recently, yesterday, I had
someone volunteer to buy him one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: new $4,000 triple chip Panasonics to take
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think our quality of our pictures
will increase a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This next section is a little slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a night video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know where the fast forward is,
Art, fast forward for about two minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll move on down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd ask him to get some video for us so we
could see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he obliged.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a, Audrey's situation is a little
different than the Meyer situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Meyer's contact started, it was like
going to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came by almost on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was almost a classroom situation
where he would ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would give answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would teach him things about history,
philosophy, and spirituality that they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Audrey Ains' situation is quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never knows when they're coming by.
[SPEAKER_02]: They treat him like a lost relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they do come by, they pick him up,
tell him to be quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got things to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hangs out with them for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't usually ask for any favors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even for the summer, they told him
they're kind of busy and they just left
[SPEAKER_02]: him alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't even sure when they were coming
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a little different situation
going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never sure exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I ask him to get some video,
he says, all right, I'll try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got the camera and he went out at
night to take the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: This video, by the way, is just south of
Miami on the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was directed for him and his girlfriend
to go down there, which they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: First there was just one craft until they
parked the car and got their bearings and
[SPEAKER_02]: set out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then two came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Art, you can fast forward a little bit
more and then we'll get a little group
[SPEAKER_02]: thing going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, now we're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is similar to some of the shots we've
also seen down in Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that area down there, there's quite a
bit of shots being seen at night with
[SPEAKER_02]: groups of them coming and making
formations like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually ran the camera for about 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we're fast forwarding a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, it gets a little more exciting
here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, Art, roll it on forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take it down to where the screen
will suddenly kind of go bright red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be about another minute or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've put together a collection of most
all of these pictures, quite a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't on here today, too,
have a new videotape called the Miami
[SPEAKER_02]: Contacts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be out next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a table somewhere over here in the
exhibit room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to see it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll have some forms there for
anybody that wants to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these pictures and quite a few more
will be on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've prepared a tape tomorrow night,
which we'll have quite a bit more on
[SPEAKER_02]: there, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what time it's showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 8 o'clock?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing it at 8 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up right after this, there's two
sections here where there's three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right after that, there's a
pretty interesting daytime shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of his contacts, since he's quite
telepathic, he says they get in touch with
[SPEAKER_02]: him and let him know they're around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since he lives in a centralized area
in Miami, it's common for them to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: cloaked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just communicate with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then occasionally, they'll let him
know they're outside if he wants to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on this particular occasion coming up
out here, he was actually in the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told him they were outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he wanted to get some video,
he could.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he grabbed his camera, ran in the
living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see it here in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craft's outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's taking the picture through the
screen because he just noticed that
[SPEAKER_02]: outside there's a bunch of people playing
golf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he doesn't have any clothes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's telling them to hang on for a
minute while he gets some pants on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the camera's jumping
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he doesn't want to open the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's throwing the focus off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they came back later that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he walked out on the patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they let him get a little better shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you'll remember from the earlier shot
there's water right in front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say those are a good quarter mile away
on the other side of the park over there
[SPEAKER_02]: in those buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can see the lights coming out
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got a second generation copy
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to inform him that we like
originals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was concerned about tape costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he took his original, copied it over to
a VHS, and then redid the original because
[SPEAKER_02]: he only had one tape cassette.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to educate him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd educate him a little bit about saving
all those originals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that craft up in the clouds again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the antenna coming out the top
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, by the way, one of the ones we
have the original negative on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got them now on several of the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just beginning to get them
analyzed by some independent imaging
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far they've given this shot anyway
a real clean bill of health.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't find anything wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything matches up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no tampering with the film.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't have too many negatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these pictures, unfortunately,
were Polaroids with a rubber band around
[SPEAKER_02]: them and his dresser.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't really expect to ever show them
to anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's most unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shadow on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got a telepathic message, looked
outside expecting his Pleiadian friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was a life form out there in
some sort of environment suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went outside with his camera,
and the bean forced his hands down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and made him take a picture of the
shadow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as he raised his arms back,
up to talk to the bean, he vanished right
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't have any clue at all where the
life form came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's a couple of shots on the patio
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's lowered the camera down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the disc there through the
bars on the patio, trying to get something
[SPEAKER_02]: in the foreground so you can see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look on the far left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just barely in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the German Hannibus from the
Space City.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 40-year-old craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three on the right are crafts made
in Space City down there by American
[SPEAKER_02]: people with the aid of the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're teaching them their technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking them back and forth to
other worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their philosophy seems to be to take a
small percentage of us, educate us in
[SPEAKER_02]: matters of spirituality, higher
consciousness, how to live a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: quality life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can stop the tape there,
Art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start the VHS whenever you
want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their philosophy seems to be to educate a
few of us that could come back and then
[SPEAKER_02]: educate the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They realize that it would be rather
futile to try to make a landing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: White House lawn or to take over the
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: See it disappearing?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that craft you saw at night,
and it's a frame-by-frame shot of it
[SPEAKER_02]: disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how they power the field up and
how it disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always wondering why you can't see
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that ability, and there we've
got it on film, frame-by-frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craft is still setting right there,
and you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a series on here now of several
nighttime shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see he's panning back to show the
foreground, how far away that he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where he lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a pretty interesting patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm just going to go down there
and, you know, rinse space on his patio
[SPEAKER_02]: for a few weeks and kind of hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe one more time we'll get to
see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is another one of the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have time to edit all these
together properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This talk came a little quicker than I had
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't found anybody else that has seen
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found two other people in his meditation
study group who've gone out with him and
[SPEAKER_02]: seen the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ladies just during a meditation
asked him how to see the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave her some clues on what to meditate
on and when she left that night,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the craft followed over her car all
the way home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Wendell and I discussed that one
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendell's guessing Southeast Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a guess at all, and Audrey
doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said it really wouldn't do you much
good if you did know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to get to it, and with the
technology they have, they wouldn't let
[SPEAKER_02]: you in anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are no roads to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhere in South America,
but I really don't know where.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is some new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a call about a week ago from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said they came by again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This next series now for about three or
four minutes was all shot on October 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, he's on his patio, and you can
see the telephone pole is off in the
[SPEAKER_02]: distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three or four blocks away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in the middle of the telephone pole,
here comes the disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll move to the left, and they're
talking to him in his head now telling him
[SPEAKER_02]: to get ready, and they're giving him some
instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've asked him, basically they've asked
him if he can leave the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked if we could get some more video in
some area where the craft was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more obvious, other things to compare it
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said they would, and that's what
you're going to see next.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to lead him around town and
down the freeway and follow him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can see the apartment building
is down at the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now where the clock on the VCR is running,
we're 10.03 on October 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got the things zoomed out about
as far as he can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how far away it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to fake something like these next
shots, you'd have to have some serious
[SPEAKER_02]: cooperation with somebody in a helicopter,
some sort of large illuminated object that
[SPEAKER_02]: half the city would see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting that watch this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see it now for a minute or
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flickering.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a light flickering off the bottom
of it and going around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is very similar to video taken by
other people in Mexico and other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen video shot down in Mexico,
and probably somebody here at the Congress
[SPEAKER_02]: may have something that looks very similar
to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my belief this is happening all
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we have one group down in
South America that is somehow coordinating
[SPEAKER_02]: contacts with people all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are keeping them all separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not allowing the contact person to
know who the other individual is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meyer always believed he was the only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he really believed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't turn out to be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people having contacts all over
the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell them they're special.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell them that they're unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: In almost every case, too, they all have
been told that there is some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual connection through past lives,
which may be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meyer had many beliefs of who he had been
historically in past lives connected to
[SPEAKER_02]: the growth of our civilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrienne is the same situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also believes that he has been several
rather important historic people involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in the development of life here on our
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite possible that's exactly
what they've been doing, pulling people
[SPEAKER_02]: off on the other side, bringing them into
physical life at a time when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And causing great change in our history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 10-14.
[SPEAKER_02]: This went on for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tape goes clear to 10-58.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just sent me copies of it,
brief little excerpts that you'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at 10-14 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We jumped to 10-40 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any second now, we're going to be out on
the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a jumpy tape.
Anybody else see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him if they did, especially when
you see the stuff on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you'd think everybody had a wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That particular night, October 20th,
he knew they were coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, he did tell me about a week
earlier that he would be having a contact
[SPEAKER_02]: that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that certain characteristics in
the magnetic field of the planet itself
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitate having contacts better on some
times than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the Pleiadian disk that we're
looking at here, he says, have to convert
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves from fine matter into solid
form so that we can see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here we're on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the disk is floating over some
buildings over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it's over the Miami airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him, did anybody else see them?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says no, that they opened the dimension
door, brought the craft in, they tuned it
[SPEAKER_02]: to his wavelength, his brain wave,
whatever, and he's the only one that can
[SPEAKER_02]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I understood that technology
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says even on some occasions he doesn't
see the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tell him where to aim and he can only
see it by the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he looks through the camera,
he can see it and not with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is rather baffling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly a technology that's a
little bit beyond our understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can control reflected light,
that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how they could narrow it down to just
one individual is something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have people and it's flying right
along down by the freeway now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it's jumping around a lot and it
didn't before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you're doing,
Art?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well this is a slow-mo that he did of the
thing where it's moving behind trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned it up a lot on the tape so you
can see it frame by frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting a real good
representation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well they seem to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That situation happened several times in
the Meyer case where several people that
[SPEAKER_02]: drove him out to context took cameras and
were not able to get pictures themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: while Billy was nearby getting a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they somehow managed to confine it
out to the individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: These next pictures here on my last trip
down there, I was flipping through his
[SPEAKER_02]: photo book again and he had inserted some
pictures in here I hadn't seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the top of one of those disks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my camcorder with me and I just
added them on here so I thought you'd like
[SPEAKER_02]: to see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, this disk here, the Pleiadian
disk, has time travel capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the early craft, the levitation
craft, that the Germans were designing in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 30s could travel 30 to 40,000 miles an
hour and they were able to visit all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the planets in our solar system even in
the late 30s and were building craft in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 40s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of their association with the ETs,
they've kind of disconnected themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: for their concern for our day-to-day
living as you might well imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have built a variety of different
types of crafts and have been very
[SPEAKER_02]: involved now in their own interplanetary
discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we've got a picture from the top of
the top of the cupola of one of those and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can almost see the framework of the
craft and here's one right below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how these pictures were
taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hasn't explained them yet, but we're
obviously pretty close or else somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: had a pretty good zoom lens when they got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks as though the air or the clouds
right below the craft is somehow being
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbed by the field of the ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes they are and apparently, I've been
told anyway, that's my job here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he asked me to do this because
he doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've asked them if I can, you know,
we turn about, it's fair play,
[SPEAKER_02]: could I go aboard the craft and meet them
and he's been him-hawing now for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just trying to get me a ride,
but it hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my camera ready though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have one sighting about a week or
so ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I were driving back here from
Vegas and down by Zuzik's Road by Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a large one come right by us and go
right down behind the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something sitting on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Audrey says it's a type of remote craft
and he didn't take the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave him the picture, but he was not
familiar with it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well up until he told me they were
building him here, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one here, which is a beam ship type,
is very similar to the style that the
[SPEAKER_02]: Germans were building years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tend to think that that one is
probably designed and still built here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells me even the BMW is still involved
and makes parts and sends them down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: space city for some of the disk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You believe that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is a view from the top of the
Pleiadian disk, which is quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have to begin to consider,
I asked Audrey anyone to ask us,
[SPEAKER_02]: well perhaps we should consider the idea
that there are no Pleiadians at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're just looking at continued
advancement in the German situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, oh no, there's a vast difference
in the Germans and the Pleiadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the tape, Art.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bring the lights up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells me that the main difference is
between the Pleiadians and the Germans,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Germans when they visit are no
different than you and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look just the same as we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the same size.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Wendell gets many reports of the
same thing they could pass in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells me at the space city when he was
there a Pleiadian craft came in and he
[SPEAKER_02]: says the place gets like church.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crafts are larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the craft sets down everybody gets
very reverent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pleiadians are larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seven to eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says you can best describe them as like
perfect beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no flaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no lines on their skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says for the most part they are so
incredibly spiritually advanced that just
[SPEAKER_02]: being around them, he says, puts you a
little bit in awe because you can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: they know everything about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can sense your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel you and there's nothing that you
can hide from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says they're very peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately you feel tremendous sort of
love and compassion from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't talk much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says you might ask them a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pretty much know what you're going
to ask before you ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pause for a second, scan your
thoughts to see how well you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with the answer, decide to tell you
what to tell you, give you the answer very
[SPEAKER_02]: succinctly and quietly and stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says there's a vast difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says they come in and out of the space
city all the time and he says everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: down there reveres them pretty much like
gods down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So well that's I think our kind of our
latest Pleiadian update.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay we got about five minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything for Wendell or me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you'd like to ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to the mic Bob says so we can get it
on the tape there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they give you any indication which
particular star in the Pleiades system
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: The new contacts Audrey Ains says are all
from the Alcyone area.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the Meyer years Meyer was always
very emphatic that all of his contacts
[SPEAKER_02]: were from one group from Taygeta and he
believed they were from only one solar
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Audrey Ains says that in the Alcyone area,
which is the principal area where they
[SPEAKER_02]: come from, there are hundreds of planets
with civilized life there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the underground facilities here on
Earth have been built and maintained by
[SPEAKER_02]: the Alcyone group for a long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: During one of the previous presentations
by Norio we were shown satellite
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities of the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a possibility the government is
aware of space city and if so what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that the higher levels above
governments everybody knows what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're aware of the space city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do them any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't come in and out anyway and he
says there are people at the space city,
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives from governments and from
the CIA, that the CIA to some extent has
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of a liaison between them and
governments for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vladimir, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: One question, Vladimir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I wanted to make a little note on
the first photograph that Wendell showed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a photograph of the Vril Odin
craft built in 44 across that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first terrestrially built craft with warp
speed capability that departed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: first interstellar flight 50 years this
April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the reason we made the big
documentary for Nippon Television and this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the topic of my little
unauthorized presentation tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
