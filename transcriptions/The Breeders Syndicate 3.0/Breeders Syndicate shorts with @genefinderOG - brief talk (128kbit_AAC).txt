[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a fascinating book,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sequel, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to wait to... It's like the
second album.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, I'll make a great book,
but shit that's happening now is even more
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exceptional, exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot going on now, which is kind
of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this crazy split between all the
people who are trying to run their small
[SPEAKER_01]: operations like we always did in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost all our farms in California a few
years ago due to all kinds of reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly legal and zoning and all this
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when these larger operations are
going, there seems to be a big split in
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I'd rather work with some of
those guys who want to do bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then keep them real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather be in it than out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, everybody should be able to
grow whatever the hell they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: To put the pressure on those big guys,
there should be product everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone should be able to grow
whatever the hell they want, in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everyone's freaking out about these big
grows coming on, the only way is to have
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% of the production come from small
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the pressure back on those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the people that have been making
the community run the whole time,
[SPEAKER_00]: get together, do a Voltron grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the only way to fight
corporations is to become the opposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not necessarily be cutthroat like
them, but you just do it right yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: with the guys who have been pushing it all
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you're allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also that thing is you can
brew your own beer, but who does,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a place for the other side too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's up to the smaller growers to keep
the bigger growers accountable for what
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes them a long time to turn around
and move and get genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the advantage is always with the
little guy, as long as they're organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though I'm running a couple of
big greenhouses doesn't mean I don't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still where my heart is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd also be nuts not to take that
opportunity to run those big greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: just for the ability to grow out seeds
from you guys, Kama, all those other guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then helping that breeding
process and then pass those cuts back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Carmen told you,
but I'm going to be bringing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: rare African strains that haven't been
grown like outside of Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, you know, have the
Malawis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same strains of Malawi that have
been passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a lot of different stuff I'm
bringing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sitting on them for a long time
because I have zero outdoor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want them to be able to grow where
they're happiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do such great cultivation out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a place for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're yours to grow when you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, there's the R&D space that
we have with Kama and my friend Gordon
[SPEAKER_01]: down at Elephant Head Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy who helped write some of the
laws, the better side of the laws in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the best guy you'll ever meet in any
kind of industry anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wants to grow a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants us to make a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been throwing Claude de Silva
around for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like he's made crosses of Swazis and
pure ties and pure hazes that we made back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generations in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He still doesn't know what he's doing,
but the stuff's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a really good person in Arizona
that we can do research in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also where we can make seeds to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the heart is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we'll put that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it needs to go, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could grow it here, but it just
wouldn't be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be no point in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't see it at its best expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be a loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be selfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, I think it would be selfish
for me to try to grow it indoors and not
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be selfish to the whole weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, I mean, all these genetics,
I mean, I'm helping on four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: operations here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single one needs, they have
different clearances, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how special is the genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to put them there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones I get, all the special ones
are the real down to earth, the real guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't even want, the
corporate guys don't even want that other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really kind of important to put
the right stuff in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of where our angle still
is, you know, like keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Shervinsky's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably, he's the only guy I got,
if I'm being honest, he's the only guy I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a ton of respect from that isn't
involved with the cookie guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the only one doing real work out of
all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of respect for that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool to see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Jigga too, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think Jigga does a lot of
good work too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, they're the only two that I've
met, but I haven't met Jigga yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't met Jigga yet, but yeah,
a lot of people like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're both, it's an amazing
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I got that cookie clone really,
really early on when, as I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you put this in your greenhouses and
you'll have no problem, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what's the major appeal
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Sherv, the Gelato, all that
stuff's really easy to grow, but
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin production is next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since there's no pistols to rot in
high humidity, there's like, it's solid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and as long, as long as you,
you're able to like, you see the inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowers, you know, that's,
that's the only thing like we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about monsoon season here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I have to be, I do not have
anything hiding inside any flower that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what's in it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So during monsoon, it's the case of I'm
only going to grow stuff I can look
[SPEAKER_01]: inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients don't get a surprise,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cookies and OGs are off the menu
for 12 weeks and then full force again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a bunch of Nigerians.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of hazes, a bunch of amnesias.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like 13 weeks of solid sativa runs
coming up, which will be... That'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All selection, you know, all our own
selections and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in, back in Amsterdam,
what was, what were some of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: strains you were growing when you were,
when you were out there and, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to grow and do other stuff with
cannabis in early nineties, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis college in 97, we mostly worked
with all the skunk bands, F1s,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we later developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first serious seed stuff was there,
some Adams THC stuff, Sagamata,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a show grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody had a little section.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 150 plants in the garden and a big
stake next to it, which, which seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've planted 30 seeds of each
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would go for a tour and then
they'd go across the streets by the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: because they'd see a grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most, more interesting ones
where we crossed all the skunk band stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with all the different Ingemar's
widows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the whole, the whole line all with
widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a super widow line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew a shitload of those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, that was some pretty
interesting stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original Hayes with that white widow
came out, you know, like 50% resin weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: no yield, but 50% resin weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the really nice turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was for me, interesting at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the F2s and stuff as well from
Dave's stuff was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherb has a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best strain you've ever grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure anything pops up at the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that you're more partial to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like NL5 Hayes skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we developed our own line of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the super silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Jack Hara.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Esquizia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are legendary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every now and again, a cut came up,
pain cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dream was always anybody who had
beef, I'm going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of hundred of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three way seeds and then just rework
them and cross them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Ingemar's white widow and
Scott's white widow would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I cross them together, I'm healing some
beef, you know, the super silver thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so I kind of like that,
but that that's always been my go to that
[SPEAKER_01]: three way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Delta nine labs did some stuff
with their fruit of the gods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, there was another
skunk or like Hayes and I found some,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I ran a shitload of those,
but there were two or three phenos in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that were fucking exceptional that
stood out among the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that combination just seems to bring
winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never, you never forget those though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still bugs me to this day, because I
mean, Eddie got robbed at gunpoint and
[SPEAKER_01]: they took like 55 gallons worth of seeds
out of his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the stuff we worked on, F3,
F4, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of lost a little bit of hope for
a while then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now, you know, with the help of
gamma and Colorado and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other guys, we're collecting a whole bunch
of new three way stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I still have some of the old
Northern Lights skunk Hayes, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the germination rates kind of shit,
but I'll bring them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to, if we pull it all together
and put it all on the table and we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting around the table, we can start
looking at it and having a giggle,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like these different lines and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, something's going to
come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't wait to go to the facility
and hang out with you guys for a few days
[SPEAKER_00]: and get to see it all and play around and
learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of states to pick
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to go find my drone again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute pleasure and an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to short for coming on attitude
anytime he comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time and fuck guys,
a repository of knowledge, absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: repository of knowledge and the amount of
hands-on work that he experiences with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different strains is a fuck next
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory on the hermaphroditism in
strains today, I think it's more to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with a mass amount of new growers,
not quite knowing what they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite knowing how to feed plants,
going with bottle schedules and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to bring sure bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he still in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fucking love to bring sure bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it has more to do with new
growers not knowing how to feed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them like tomatoes and just really
not knowing what direction they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: and also being the majority of the people
who are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear a lot of older growers
bitching about herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we just deal with it and we
realize that's part of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's not happy in our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We either acclimate it because it's really
special and we know that or we just move
[SPEAKER_00]: on and toss it and it's just whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a herm happen, it's usually
because of something to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment or how it's being fed,
any of that expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everything can be acclimated to not
herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like auto flowering traits and
stuff like that, for me, that's a sure
[SPEAKER_00]: toss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some companies get just scalped
over the years, scalped and raked over the
[SPEAKER_00]: herm thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the ones who ...
