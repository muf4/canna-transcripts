[SPEAKER_00]: and do some, you know, find the recessive
trades, you know, markers on what every
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You collect data points, you collect as
much as you can on turf profiles and noses
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be a pollen checker and still
do that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's like you're actually,
so breeders actually are phenohunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the biggest part too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pheno and genotype hunting goes
on and you basically have to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and get your nose on stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use those things for future
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say you know, you mean like,
you know, you're growing it in Arizona,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's more like geoclimatized
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geoclimatized is different, but basically
genotype would be like the structure or
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the leaf sets are, things that
aren't going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with phenotypical expression,
phenotypical expression can be affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can take the same kind as you,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could grow it in my house and we
could grow it at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to express two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get different phenotypical
expression, whereas the genotype could be
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the way- So like a freak
show, that's the specific genotype of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to spot that genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could smell different and that
would be the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of behind it, you know.
