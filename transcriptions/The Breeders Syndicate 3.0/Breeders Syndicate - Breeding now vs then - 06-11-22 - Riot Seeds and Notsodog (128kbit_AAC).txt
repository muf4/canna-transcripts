[SPEAKER_02]: for this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I think is probably what's
happening indeed Yeah Indeed, so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: do a giveaway at some point tonight and
we'll have to figure out how to run it But
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably leave that up to you because
it's much easier to put it off on you To
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out how to do the giveaway to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already got a hundred and fourteen
hundred sixteen something like that So
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever you want to kick it off we can I
mean the funniest thing is because I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that because I do this shit a lot
Yeah Like if I sit back this far,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't see any other comments You
also could potentially be getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: blowjob off camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could happen I suppose but then they
you know, they did but it's so then if I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see what people are saying Then I
have to make my head like take The full
[SPEAKER_03]: frame, you know, it is what it is on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is So we have blue bonnet
available uncle Brizzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a right seat co.com So yeah,
I guess we are getting we are getting up
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah or whatever so Do you know actually I
I don't even know why this stuck in my
[SPEAKER_03]: head But I can't remember what it's called
because it's Russian and I have terrible
[SPEAKER_03]: pronunciation Yeah, but they used to do
they used to do this gambling thing We're
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's a bunch of dudes sitting
around like a huge table, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's like One chick underneath
giving head to someone uh-huh,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to figure out who it is And
if they can tell you're getting it you
[SPEAKER_03]: lose a bunch of money So there's all these
dudes with their pants off and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: to sit there like all stoic Yeah,
I think that's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one under the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, like balls indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a trust situation It's a trust
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I often speaking of
Russian I often refer to when you Go to to
[SPEAKER_02]: expel a fart and you're not sure if it's
fully loaded and you're gonna have some
[SPEAKER_02]: blowback I call I refer to that as Russian
roulette Russian roulette.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope I know the chambers loaded I
hope that I I make it to old age where
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just not a worry Yeah, not everyone
has the same worries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have I have that worry at this age So
this ain't no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a unique collection of worries
that are just yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they might not pertain to
everyone else You know Anyway,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we got enough people here we can
start or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for joining again on
Friday night we have kind of like a Little
[SPEAKER_03]: collection of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were gonna talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came up on our on our our discord this
week like some breeding expectations and
[SPEAKER_03]: Just seeing what people commented about
breeders today versus breeders yesterday
[SPEAKER_03]: or yesterday Last year, we figured like we
could chat a bit about like even what
[SPEAKER_03]: people expected Yeah, like what
expectations were and how expectations
[SPEAKER_03]: like have always sort of shaped what
breeders do Yeah, even from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had a comment come in that I
thought was kind of interesting that like
[SPEAKER_03]: Could sort of tie into that which is like
people wanted us to talk about beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Really boosters indeed, which we
actually have some We actually have some
[SPEAKER_03]: good friends that could talk a lot more
eloquently probably than we could on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But What I thought was interesting could
be interesting is we could talk for a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about Like how it affected America?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like how to change things here how
it changed the homegrown scene here how it
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just certain aspects of it,
right so I don't know we We could start we
[SPEAKER_03]: could start any any which way because I
guess I guess maybe two beats There's
[SPEAKER_03]: would be sort of like the The first like
commercialization of kind of yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right Yeah, because everybody else
was getting it usually from some there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't really commercial scenes then Sure
now and and you couldn't really call
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican brick beasters necessarily No,
there was commercial Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously that had been commercialized for
a long time Yeah, but like there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: situation in most parts of the country
even in the West Coast where there wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: enough good Kind bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I never even got it a whiff of BC
Beasters ever in my life never saw them
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't make it down all the way down
to Bakersfield or San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never saw any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean it it permeated all over the place,
especially the East Coast Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet and it had it had different effects
strangely enough in different places I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess we'll start talking about this
because we're already into it but like so
[SPEAKER_03]: you take beasters and somewhere like The
southeast right or certain like that that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be the only non Mexican bud you
could get Yeah, like it might have been
[SPEAKER_03]: all and like what people don't get is like
in the 90s and stuff like that You know It
[SPEAKER_03]: was still super prohibited, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they you know, so it kept it
really small.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was way more demand than there was
supply Right and that's kind of what made
[SPEAKER_03]: everything easy to sell because you could
always always sell whatever because it
[SPEAKER_02]: like it so I mean for example in a place
we have here called cottonwood a type of
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed was going around called nade.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was old commercial not I mean,
but Mexican brick Sprayed with raid and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd call it nade and that was a thing
and they could sell that and move that You
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything could be built in some guy
all upset like he's like fuck beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got fire here on the southeast I mean
the era that we're talking about is the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s and so there wasn't enough fire
anywhere Yeah, like fire was hard to get
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know and people had it but and
fires relative Fires relative and for like
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the reason why and people if
someone even asked I'm 22.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are beasters?
[SPEAKER_03]: beasters literally is indoor indoor weed
grown in Canada and Shipped to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah at scale Right that was in the 90s
and into the into the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_03]: right and so people think people laugh at
it now, but the reason why it was so
[SPEAKER_03]: successful was because For most people I
mean, you know your access was like green
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican brown Mexican Oh, you know or like
you had a buddy who had a buddy who had a
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy who maybe every once in a while
could get you a quarter a kind of Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so beasters filled that void,
you know, and now it's like You say the
[SPEAKER_03]: word beasters and people have all kinds of
comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making right now, but in the
beginning None of that was no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Right, like it was like so in a lot
of parts of the country It was the only it
[SPEAKER_03]: was the only kind bud regularly available
Right and even in California California it
[SPEAKER_03]: fucked us up Right because and it asked in
a way I actually feel like it it sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: started the purple wave in California I
almost yeah, I almost I I I think it had a
[SPEAKER_03]: big play a big part of it how so What
happened is is that back then,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know most indoor or most outdoor or
whatever even outdoor and stuff There
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't a tons of depths.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't tons of outdoor and stuff
like that Most people were growing were
[SPEAKER_03]: growing pounds in the in the dozens of
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the hundreds of pounds Yeah outside
and then most indoors were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know four to twelve lights or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so You know, there was an aspect
where all that stuff was expensive Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, and so people So, you know what
brokers are like, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So you have this choice where you can
come to Mendo and you can get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: fireweed for like 42 Yeah, right or You
can talk to these Canadians and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get a bunch of beasters for 23.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the brokers gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nine times out of ten pick cheap So
nine times out of ten, they're gonna pick
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so and they're gonna make a hell of a
margin, you know And so what happened is
[SPEAKER_03]: is that there was a in California there
was good weed to be smoked but what the
[SPEAKER_03]: brokers tried to do which is what they
tried to do forever is like It's no
[SPEAKER_03]: different than like can I make these
depths look like ends?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are these outs good enough to look
like depths?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they good enough to look like
something better than they are because
[SPEAKER_03]: then I can make the profit difference
Between like what those sell for and what
[SPEAKER_03]: these sell for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so in like, you know, and you know a
lot of parts of the country Beasters was
[SPEAKER_02]: all there was so it was like fuck you take
it Yeah, I mean if one dude was the only
[SPEAKER_02]: plug-in town and he decides to take
beasters over some kind But then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna get to smoke beasters and
that's that yeah, or you're gonna buy
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly Those are your issues,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So but then in California they had to pass
it off a lot of times As homegrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Because other California people were
edgy the West Coast and Oregon and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew enough That like they weren't
gonna pay that kind of pricing for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they had other options.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could find somebody that had
homegrown Yeah, so then the middlemen
[SPEAKER_03]: tried to make beasters look like homegrown
Sure, right and it worked for a time
[SPEAKER_03]: because everybody's commenting right now
and I see all of you right and now it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty well known that a lot of Beasters
were grown like too much salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were harvested a little early They
weren't cured as as nicely as they should
[SPEAKER_03]: have been they were packaged in and seal a
meal airtight containers and zipped close
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then by the time that they got
to where they were going they had suffered
[SPEAKER_03]: a quality issue Yeah, it wasn't as nice as
it was where it began Right like sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it could smell like hey sometimes it could
smell a little a little a little weird a
[SPEAKER_03]: little off a little Yeah, people saying
PGRs, but at the time people didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: most of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like you could either get Mexican
or this Yeah That was or like you had you
[SPEAKER_03]: had you were a lucky enough person that
you grew or you knew someone close to you
[SPEAKER_03]: that grew Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that you could get some eighths or
some quarters or a zip every two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: months and you know, there's also Mexicans
that would come up that were like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a red hue and That was a lessee a lot
of people using the word for tentacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really use that So we didn't get
the BC Beasters, but our pretend to kill
[SPEAKER_02]: was the uncompressed Mexican that would
come down Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago pretend to kill was No So Chicago
pretend to kill was in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a ton of ditch weed Yeah,
right and ditch weed is basically like
[SPEAKER_03]: leftover wild hemp from yeah World War two
hemp for victory thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well some of that can look beautiful so
sometimes Entrepreneurs would go out there
[SPEAKER_03]: and and get a bunch of pounds of gorgeous
looking hemp Yeah, and dry it nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd sell $300 ounces of weed that
looked incredible But you couldn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: high off it and I didn't even know what
CBD was back then, you know I'd never it
[SPEAKER_03]: just didn't I I just was shocked because
my green Mexican got me higher Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought that was weird because
the uncompressed brick almost always You'd
[SPEAKER_02]: get higher off the fucking shittier high
compressed brick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost always so there was a weird
thing So what happened what I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is a roundabout way of saying
it's so sorry for everybody but what I
[SPEAKER_03]: think happened in California is that You
had this thing where?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were flooding the West Coast
with all this indoor Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all these brokers are moving this
indoor from kit from Canada and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the margin convincing people it's
It's Californian or it's Oregonian or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know, it's Washington It's
homegrown and then eventually people
[SPEAKER_03]: started noticing the differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started looking for the rock hard PGR
buds They started looking for certain
[SPEAKER_03]: noses Sometimes they started looking even
for like the way it was seal a meal You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, like people would get it and they
would cut open all the seal a meals and
[SPEAKER_03]: they would put it into turkey bags Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah in order to like make it seem like it
wasn't from where it was from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah and and You know,
and so what happened is is that you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: all these brokers trying to pass off weed
that they bought for 22 2300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah into the force and You're trying to
actually find some of that actual cap
[SPEAKER_03]: tally in homegrown Yeah, right and so when
the irk and the and the Mendo P and the
[SPEAKER_03]: granddaddy and all that started selling in
the bay and going for it There wasn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of Canadian weed that looked purple
Yeah, no that no now I get what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you could see it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They would see it They would send up all
these people to Humboldt and Mendo and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's different spots and grab as much perp
as they took Because it was an easier
[SPEAKER_03]: hustle for them because everyone they gave
it to they knew they weren't getting
[SPEAKER_03]: bunked with some fake Beasters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then one sense once that toehold
took place in At least in NorCal once that
[SPEAKER_03]: toehold took place then it was Just like a
self-sustaining thing Yeah, right and all
[SPEAKER_03]: the brokers couldn't pass off Beast as
homegrown Yeah, because everybody wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: like one of these half a dozen purple
strains and you could sell endless amounts
[SPEAKER_02]: of those I Remember, you know growing some
of the Canadian purples in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no way they could be passed
off as Indoor anything I remember that
[SPEAKER_02]: most of them had to be grown outdoor in
the first place and they were just very
[SPEAKER_02]: loose purple sometimes but not very Not
very grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it was one of those things
that it just it just like made it
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctive I mean there was a time to
were like the with the early dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that part of the reason why
the dispensaries could move endless
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts of perps was because all their
customers knew that the dispensary wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: buying cheap beast and Flipping it for the
high They were just buying fucking Mendo
[SPEAKER_03]: perps and flipping it because it won't get
you Well, yeah, I mean it's not so much
[SPEAKER_03]: that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like because Everybody's affected
differently but sure the Canadian weed
[SPEAKER_03]: because it wasn't dried as nicely as we
like to do it Oh, yeah, I'm sure and then
[SPEAKER_03]: it was it was put it was you know And then
once you seal something up for a few weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: wet What you know, it's gonna firm it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me nice and then it's gonna
be compressed lightly So like cuz any kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of smuggling is all about shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about volume and space,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure So you get this weed that like is
like it probably if it would have stayed
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was gonna stay And got dried
really nicely probably would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, but then you you harvest
it a little early You don't flush it you
[SPEAKER_03]: package it a little too moist You put it
into an airtight thing and you scrunch it
[SPEAKER_03]: down on itself You know You know they and
so that and so then there was occasionally
[SPEAKER_03]: some really nice beasters You know,
there was there was some really good weed
[SPEAKER_03]: that came out of there, but just the over
the overall flood Was pretty lowbrow Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the overall flood was pretty lowbrow But
for a lot of places people think of now
[SPEAKER_03]: right where it's like the West Coast is
just sending You know people joke on IG
[SPEAKER_03]: for years about how the West Coast just
sends all their bunk east Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: right and it's like a running joke because
of how much work that gets grown in on the
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast of America would get sent to
other parts of America Yeah, but in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s there wasn't a flood like that Yeah,
there wasn't a flood going east at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just teasing about Mendo perps guys
It's just a lot of people always say it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get them high.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean There's very few strains that
that have everything Yeah, Mendo purse has
[SPEAKER_03]: an unbelievable look.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has an unbelievable set of turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breeds really well It does all this
this cool stuff, but because it's so old
[SPEAKER_03]: it's low THC Yeah You know It is and so,
you know, like one of our buddy,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Caleb I mean one of his better
crosses of it is to the the bubble Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an Obama Kush or whatnot,
you know because the bubba adds frost and
[SPEAKER_03]: density and some potency and The Mendo
adds color and turps and shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah And so, you know and then
different people like I I actually like if
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke Mendo pee in the morning Like it
actually makes me creative rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: couch lock Yeah, that's a good thought if
I like wake up and drink some coffee and
[SPEAKER_03]: eat some food and I smoke some Mendo pee
And I start writing down my list of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to accomplish Yeah, like I my brain
works that are pretty good level Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know a sour dub in the morning and
then I usually am asleep Right after
[SPEAKER_02]: writing that little note of things to do I
mean it's there for the future at least
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is there for tonight,
but so like for so basically like
[SPEAKER_03]: Beasters, too It's like we're not gonna do
a whole show On it, but Beasters affected
[SPEAKER_03]: different parts of the country in
different ways Yeah, right in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did kind of spark the purple
wave Because people didn't want to get
[SPEAKER_03]: stuck with Beasters But in other parts of
the country there wasn't that much choice
[SPEAKER_03]: like my buddies and this is what this is
what's crazy Is that so my friends in
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago that stayed there obviously when I
moved west, okay Yeah, you know how for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people Beasters dropped a price of
what they were able to get to some degree
[SPEAKER_03]: it affected price Points in California,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well in Chicago it made their prices go up
Yeah, because they were like well this if
[SPEAKER_03]: this goes for four then my shit six You
know, yeah and they actually flipped it
[SPEAKER_03]: and they did better because of it Because
their homegrown was their home.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super nice indoor homegrown was so
much danker Yeah, they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well if this is what you can get this for
then ours has to be that yeah So it
[SPEAKER_03]: literally like their stuff before Beaster
went for about what Beaster did Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then when it came in it like created
another grade of kind bud that their bud
[SPEAKER_03]: was obviously better Smart marketing,
you know and so it went up but in
[SPEAKER_03]: California it hurt us Yeah, because it was
like the first flood of cheap fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor It's crazy that it didn't affect so
Cal very much at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just didn't hit down here like
that North yeah, well There's parts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if I should say but
because there's like There is because
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, I was talking about like
just like the weed impact of it but there
[SPEAKER_03]: was obviously like some big groups
involved a lot of money at stake and a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of smoke and you know, there was there's
aspects to it that You know, and it got
[SPEAKER_03]: really honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that we should say is that
you know in the 90s and 2000 and 2001 You
[SPEAKER_03]: know America did not spend very much
energy worrying about the Canadians Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: not at all our border with the Canadians,
especially was super porous Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: right and there was a lot of independence.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of guys like with friends
on snowmobiles With you know with duffel
[SPEAKER_03]: duffel bags and there was all kinds of
crazy shit going on in terms of Getting
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff from Canada to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever see that movie kid cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah that kid was one of those
dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to one of the dudes It was
involved in it before so, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was coming over in truckloads It was
coming over, you know But in a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: places you can just go to the border and
meet up with an American on the other side
[SPEAKER_03]: of the border Yeah, it was all kinds of
shit like that going on right and then The
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking Al Qaeda crashed the planes into
New York and Flying became a lot rougher
[SPEAKER_03]: and they started paying a lot more
attention and heat Censors and all that to
[SPEAKER_03]: the board and the northern Canadian border
not because they were worried about
[SPEAKER_03]: Canucks selling weed in America,
but mostly because they were worried about
[SPEAKER_03]: You know terrorists sneaking in through
Canada So they tell you yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it just I mean I get it,
you know, it's like so they tighten the
[SPEAKER_03]: shit up Yeah, and then a lot of the ways
that and so in late 2001 a lot of the ways
[SPEAKER_03]: that people used to move it across the
border whether it was snowmobiles or
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain bike Or you know just driving
close and hiking it over and dropping it
[SPEAKER_03]: in the woods and having the Americans come
get it You know all that yeah all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden, you know Because we put all of our
money for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put the vast majority of our money into
policing the southern border Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: because there was just a fuck ton of
heroin and cocaine and weed Issues and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know all that and so the Canadians we just
weren't too we just weren't too intense on
[SPEAKER_03]: that and so You know the the and they
didn't even know that there was that much
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd happening either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's an invisibility factor to
something for a minute, right and and so
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they locked all that shit down and
they made it a lot harder Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: they did they made it a lot harder for
like independence to get it across the
[SPEAKER_03]: border so then it moved to like trucking
and Various aspects and smuggling and then
[SPEAKER_03]: what kind of groups does that bring it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course a lot bigger than just
some like independent Dude wanting to work
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever then that brings in organized
groups organized groups of various kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional organized groups various kinds
of organized groups that Existed up there,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is easy to go and read about if you
if you so choose And then like the
[SPEAKER_03]: independence all felt squeezed Yeah,
because they were all hiding from like
[SPEAKER_03]: these other groups that wanted to control
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and You know and then it really and
the reason why that all works Was because
[SPEAKER_03]: there wasn't there wasn't enough Like
people people, you know downgrade Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, California or Oregon or whatever
sends all their booth East But like there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't you know, I had friends that would
drive a bunch of work back East back in
[SPEAKER_03]: the day You know and like there wasn't any
there was almost nobody on the road doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was rare There wasn't that much
there wasn't that much excess Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in the 90s with all the
helicopters and all they have and how much
[SPEAKER_03]: you could get away with doing Or whatever
it was like we could you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: California kind of served California in
the West Yeah, and it really wasn't until
[SPEAKER_03]: 215 and a bunch of other groups got in and
things started expanding on a large level
[SPEAKER_03]: That those waves just started going
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that ended up basically doing
two things that like It it changed the
[SPEAKER_03]: margins for both the Canadians and the
Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah because that Convergence of all that
weed getting sent in You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Mexicans send like 70 80 percent
less weed into America than they used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god Yeah, right and then that's
fucked up for us too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because those guys are You know,
they're criminals You know trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so then they've got to replicate
That lost revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah and all the things that they've
decided to like Replicate that lost
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue with are all way worse than brown
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I know That's the big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well math fentanyl, you know Kidnapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll trap like coyotes moving human
trafficking like yeah, I mean they used a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of those cartels They would make 60 70
percent of their income off of wheat Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so then the way different now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so then two-thirds of that slows
down That's a lot of loot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, you know, it really is And then you
know same thing with the Canadians the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadians were sending a ton of that down
and the Mexicans were sending a ton of it
[SPEAKER_03]: north to like the voracious appetite of
America to smoke weed and Then the west
[SPEAKER_03]: coast of America started supplying
Americans with American weed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's sort of like shaved off the top
and the bottom and made it a lot less
[SPEAKER_02]: likely You know, yeah people are asking
and this is a good one and I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: easy what were some of the Strains that
were being labeled as Beasters coming over
[SPEAKER_02]: the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that probably you know The funny
part is is that I wonder how much accuracy
[SPEAKER_03]: there was between the grower the broker
you know, I would think that a lot would
[SPEAKER_02]: be different and But come over with
similar names because I think that would
[SPEAKER_03]: be whatever's in demand You know,
this would actually be I don't know if our
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy is on here tonight But but a list of
strain names he could probably pump out or
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Kootenai on here And people were
actually commenting too about how many
[SPEAKER_03]: good strains there was in Canada There was
a bunch of amazing strains in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not to diss Canada It's just that the
choices that got made to be grown for
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial consumption in America Wasn't
necessarily the creme de la creme of the
[SPEAKER_03]: choices of Canadian wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was grown for export Yeah,
I remember a lot of hash plant being
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about coming down the m39 the
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah All the stuff that they're naming
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 39 BC big buds things that things that
got them a bunch of shishkeberry things
[SPEAKER_03]: that got them a bunch of weight Yeah,
and didn't take that long, you know and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of times to me I don't know about I
don't know about if other people saw names
[SPEAKER_03]: but Mine was most most of the time that we
saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had letter grades They had like letter
grades Like you know, you're triple a Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay a B, you know B minus they would
literally have it would literally a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: them would literally have just letters on
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course everyone tried to claim
their shit was triple or quadruple a or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever Yeah, I doubt many were saying
yeah, I got some C shit want to try it
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, but sometimes I mean
sometimes it wasn't good enough to like
[SPEAKER_03]: try to play the game Yeah, like I'm gonna
give you some B You know, I'll say this
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this has nothing to do with my
work But one of the reasons why they were
[SPEAKER_03]: able to fuck with us so much as far as
like the price rate Is that back then one
[SPEAKER_03]: American dollar got you about a dollar
sixty in Canadian?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the exchange rate was amazing
Yeah, you know I'm saying so imagine you
[SPEAKER_03]: could sell your weed and you know and and
for every you know for a for in It's like
[SPEAKER_03]: they got such an exchange rate Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean you sell your weed for you
know I mean it so so they were flipping it
[SPEAKER_03]: and for us it seemed low but for them they
were getting a killer price sure You know
[SPEAKER_03]: because and that's and that's and that's
the way it worked and it came You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so it took a while but eventually just
like when I lived in when I lived in
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago I never even heard the word
tweaker You never heard the word tweak
[SPEAKER_03]: never heard the word tweaker there wasn't
tweak in my high school it didn't exist It
[SPEAKER_03]: did not it did not now eventually it it
fucking it permeated and it was all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the Midwest But I straight-up tell you in
the early 90s when I was in high school
[SPEAKER_03]: like it didn't exist So if someone would
have said tweaker to me then Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wouldn't have meant much now It
has like an enormous amount of meaning
[SPEAKER_03]: because you just know so much right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you talk about what I what I mean by
that is you talk about beasters today and
[SPEAKER_03]: it has an enormous amount of meaning to
people Yeah, but you have to realize When
[SPEAKER_03]: beasters first started hitting America,
we didn't have all this preloaded
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge about what it was like Yeah It
was just not weed that wasn't Mexican Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: right You know and Yeah, there's a dude
didn't come to the first tweak I ever saw
[SPEAKER_03]: in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ravers from San Francisco who
brought it Yeah, it was on the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in the mid in the early and mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not in the Midwest Yeah,
everyone pardon me for getting fucked up
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the show the last few weeks have
been past my move shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not not too terribly brilliant or
quick with it my apologies So everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: like fuck you looks high for once the
people said people are still asking what's
[SPEAKER_03]: what's a beaster beaster is Canadian
indoor yeah grown for America and usually
[SPEAKER_03]: it's It's usually it's harvested a little
too soon It's not flushed or dried the
[SPEAKER_03]: right way and then they put it into
airtight seal a meal bags lightly lightly
[SPEAKER_03]: to somewhat compressed and figured out How
to get it into America because there was
[SPEAKER_03]: such a demand for weed Yeah, they could
wait up They could sell endless amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so there was a huge I mean the
New England was flooded with it New York
[SPEAKER_03]: was flooded with it, you know the upper
Midwest You know the West Coast and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that and then you know, it depends it like
it got basically knocked off in In the
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast reasonably fast because of
9-eleven and then because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: burgeoning 2015 movement, right but it
persisted for years in other parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: country I'm sure it didn't is it still
persist now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think I don't know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know I mean, you know it I
couldn't tell you I mean, I bet I bet it
[SPEAKER_03]: does I bet there's markets for it Maybe
somewhere up in the north.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say You know who knows could be it
could go it could go all four Places in
[SPEAKER_03]: this it could be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know Yeah, I mean it's gone in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't see brick weed as much anymore in
California rarely if ever and it was that
[SPEAKER_02]: was like all that was here during my
teenage years I mean I live in Mendoz and
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not fucking 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't You know, I don't I haven't
seen brick weed in forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, no, it went like even the past
maybe 10 years it's still 99% of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd see people smoking at Babersfield
Blunt's and Blunt's and Blunt's a fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: brick Yeah, so people are talking Cali
Outdoors the new Beasters and Cali You
[SPEAKER_03]: know and like there's I live in California
right and there's a lot of there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of weed that sucks Yeah, you know if
there's never there's never been an era
[SPEAKER_03]: where everyone just grew the fucking
white-hot fire and that's all there was
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know I mean how many people really
grow out of everybody that's in this chat
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people really grow like the
banging, you know, I mean realistically if
[SPEAKER_02]: you compare it all it's not all gonna be
the same level And then you know on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: that It's it's like sometimes that shitty
weed is still the best that you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: like so the what sucks Is that the places
with the least choice probably get stuck
[SPEAKER_03]: with the shittiest weed the longest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it gets dislodged in places
with choice You know and you know and so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and there's an aspect too where
it's like there's there's probably a story
[SPEAKER_03]: there we've been talking about it for a
while actually, but there's probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: story there of how like of Where America
gets its wheat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and how that's shifted because in
the because there was an era there for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time where You know all of a sudden a
lot of people were getting weed and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can you can laugh at Cali weed But like
there was a lot of people getting
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonably good quality weed from from out
here There was grown with a reasonable
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of love too Yeah, you know and now
there's an aspect too where people are
[SPEAKER_03]: complaining about where things have gone
legal and the black market is just a
[SPEAKER_03]: exploded between the Asians and the
Eastern Europeans and the Cartels and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that and southern Oregon and the deserts
out by you Yeah, you know and and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: and like now there's a shit ton of weed
being grown by people that don't care at
[SPEAKER_02]: all and People yeah, we might we might
have a resurgence too because of all these
[SPEAKER_02]: people buying fucking skunk one seeds We
might have a whole fucking beast of
[SPEAKER_03]: resurgence can't wait and so, you know
There's there's an aspect too where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of the best California weed is
getting cut off You know people think you
[SPEAKER_03]: know because that's another aspect right
where it's all the it's all the brokers
[SPEAKER_03]: and the people that make it go from here
to there Yeah, they choose what what goes
[SPEAKER_03]: from here to there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they're looking at it from their
perspective of what's profitable sure and
[SPEAKER_03]: just like with the Beasters if they can
send some some Shittier stuff that way
[SPEAKER_03]: that they had a much bigger margin on and
that and that that run makes them a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably What they'll do You know,
so it's like everyone you can all all y
[SPEAKER_03]: 'all on Southeast or East or wherever you
are that like is bitching about California
[SPEAKER_03]: weed It's probably your fucking broker the
person that brought it there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they chose There was fire weed that
they probably tried to tried to fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Tried to lowball or turn down
because it didn't make them as much of a
[SPEAKER_03]: margin Sure, right margins everything's
margin You know, and so, you know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: knew somebody that like their their whole
gig was quality and and fire and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what they wanted to work with fine Yeah,
if you knew people that were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, they're not gonna have much choice
in this part So we're just gonna ship them
[SPEAKER_03]: with this then you're probably fucked
Yeah, you know then you're probably fucked
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know, and so I'm sure you know,
there's I'm sure there's still beast You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, even if it's greatly reduced,
you know I mean right now it you know most
[SPEAKER_03]: people were getting a lot of weed from
Mendo and Humboldt and Trinity and a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of smaller scenes that would all get
aggregated together Yeah, and now all that
[SPEAKER_03]: all that is the Asians and the Bulgarians
and the and the frickin and the cartels
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that growing massive plots Yeah,
and you know, why would a broker go and
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know and and so you're getting
shitty your weed Yeah You're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: shitty your weed You know lots of people
in California have the fire That doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: mean that like every person in the chain
between you and California is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: ensure that that fire makes it to you So
people are yeah and you know people are
[SPEAKER_03]: People Delta 8 is the new beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how many things when when hemp
became legal people started growing hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Spraying it with distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and literally and then and
then moving that somewhere Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's a if there's a arbitrage
opportunity where people can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: big-ass fucking margin Yeah by buying
something shittier and passing it off as
[SPEAKER_03]: something way better They're going to and
they're gonna do that with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a whole thing hash isn't my
thing But you know how much you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys know how much like CRC cheap
extracted hash got passed off as something
[SPEAKER_03]: nicer You know It's always been that way
the most common way in Mendo was I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned it before but these depths are
so beautiful I can sell them as indoor and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get a better price point Yeah,
this outdoor is so fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks at like it like it's a
well-preserved depth and I can get you
[SPEAKER_02]: more money I think that's why Lumpa like
the West Coast dog because he could sell
[SPEAKER_03]: it off his indoor pretty sure I mean
people people are and then and then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's everyone and then even if you're
honorable all it takes is one
[SPEAKER_03]: non-honorable Person in the chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take much, you know And so yeah
people are talking the old OG is around a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of people that have nice OGs
Yeah, it's just a matter of is it getting
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in bulk to come to wherever you are
Probably not is it getting grown with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same recipe they were using back then
probably not probably not you know and You
[SPEAKER_03]: know and so there's an aspect where yeah
hemp sprayed with distillate there anytime
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a way where they can find some
cheap-ass shit and can Convince you that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's nicer shit There's someone in the
middle that's making a bunch of money off
[SPEAKER_03]: that So I mean go up there and they would
fucking buy, you know $200 You know hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds in Oregon and Then they would take
a paint sprayer and they would spray it
[SPEAKER_03]: with distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would get you high and Then they'd
sell it as real outdoor One way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean that's kind of that's kind of
someone just said Athena OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a bunch of I don't know What the
fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a bunch of legal scenes and
there's a bunch of their followers and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that That have decided that the
cheapest salts on earth are of course like
[SPEAKER_03]: automated delivery is the way to grow weed
And their weed isn't as nice Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know their weed isn't as nice and so
You know, there's there's gonna be all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of that with hash there's gonna be
all kinds of that with weed and You know
[SPEAKER_03]: it it because if there's a if there's an
education difference I mean, you know how
[SPEAKER_03]: many times I used to hear up here people
would look at something and they would be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, this is fire But can they break
down some of these bigger buds a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why right, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because indoor doesn't have big buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess that makes and they're trying
to pass it off So it's like you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need anything like this,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make it Yeah, you know because
they're in their mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna they're gonna they're gonna
pass it off at symbol as some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah They're gonna say they're you know,
and they don't and they don't want the
[SPEAKER_03]: customer to be like all these look like
sun-grown nuts Yeah, cuz then they just
[SPEAKER_03]: shaved off X off their percentage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were planning on making So,
you know people California in the West
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast can get a bad rap and there's plenty
of bad weed here But it's also like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's it's it's also a bunch of
choices in between Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Athena is just like fucking lux
lighting Athena's probably owned by Jungle
[SPEAKER_03]: Boys and they and they and they promote
the shit out of it saying that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: tested it against all kinds of different
other other nutrients and it's come out
[SPEAKER_03]: the best and they grow the fire and then
they build up a bunch of sales for Athena
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's cheap and Then they're gonna
offer and they're gonna off the company
[SPEAKER_03]: and make a shit ton of money Possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah when if you want to use something
like Athena you can go buy some real cheap
[SPEAKER_03]: salts It doesn't have the Athena makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the exact same thing just in
a different bag That's how a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient companies are done I mean,
you know, there's one supplier and they
[SPEAKER_02]: ask for certain mixes and ranges But it's
all based out of the same shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that happens a lot Yeah,
you know it happens a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so There's there's an aspect where
it's like I don't dis on all salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's salts I like quite a bit actually
for the application I'm a house and garden
[SPEAKER_03]: sucker in Kana, but I like Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cutting-edge Shout out to my buddy
John You know, there's there's good salts
[SPEAKER_03]: out there used properly that'll do fine
for you, you know There's even even stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like Jack's the main issue with some of
the cheaper stuff is now that they do a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of testing a lot of it has high
heavy metal content or other Additives
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't the jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I like I like the empty
someone's asking for like a good dry salt
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the NPK brand Where you can buy
each?
[SPEAKER_02]: Individual elements separately so you can
run it exactly as you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that A lot if someone's gonna use
something old and basic I would I would
[SPEAKER_03]: almost just say use Jack's Jack's three
two one, you know, it's like a classic,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, wasn't that in the og recipe
Jack's is that might be yeah and You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I said cutting-edge, you know full
disclosure like my buddy John owns
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting-edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started it in oh one He's been a
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was grower up here from the 70s on and
so on in Mendo He knows he it's like one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the first nutrients Formulated for
growers by an old grower Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's real smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a real nice guy and it's supporting
one of us You know and People ask me how
[SPEAKER_03]: do I feel about the new line?
[SPEAKER_03]: I use the new line They're louder powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use that on like a big farm down south
for a year and a half before I left so you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, but There's an aspect there where
it's like they You know Beasters was sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of our first Beasters was sort of like the
first commercial weed that came to America
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't Mexican that was in the first
indoor commercial Yeah, right because
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans weren't really able to pull off
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: lights Like the way the BC crews were
doing at the time and the Canadian crews
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing you know, so it's kind of like
Beast to me like some of that stuff isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: that different than like a lot of these
like big Rockwell farms you see right now
[SPEAKER_03]: and fucking legal scenes It's almost like
we've come full circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just dried nicer You know,
but it's still that cardboard weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and all that, you know,
so People talk about cutting edge talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean nutrients its own whole thing or
whatever, but There's uh, you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients pretty misunderstood but you
know, there's an aspect where You know
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could get people that are Trying
to grow the best weed they can and trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a really nice number for it Or you
can get people that are just in a in a
[SPEAKER_03]: larger group that are just trying to grow
the cheapest weed They can and still get
[SPEAKER_03]: the best price they can get it Yeah,
you know and so, you know, there's a you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, there's an aspect where it's like I
don't know I almost think that probably
[SPEAKER_03]: all that stuff that they like people dis
on California for going east was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: better Than their alternatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think so It was better than it was
better than B.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably better grown than bee stir
and it was certainly nicer than Mexico
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and it got so successful
that people diss it now But why did it get
[SPEAKER_03]: that successful because it was better You
know, there was plenty of famous cuts or
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that were content there were
during the bee stir era Like I was saying
[SPEAKER_03]: before I covered it kind of covered it
northern lights mighty might grapefruit
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey donkey anything that was anything
that was big, you know And 39 was just is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the most associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to say yeah, you know,
and there's an aspect there's a guy a
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I know from Mendo saying I organic
sun grown, you know, there's an aspect of
[SPEAKER_03]: like what's the best Right, but obviously
what people are facing in the in the in
[SPEAKER_03]: the market right now is that You know a
lot of times they're not rewarded for the
[SPEAKER_03]: best Yeah island sweet skunk is fired The
silver pearl is fired to freeze land.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd call that fire That
was a little bit midsy at least as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff that I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but But yeah, you know, there's a
there's a part of it where see now It's
[SPEAKER_03]: like I start reading the comments and I
just like lose track of whatever the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about So I apologize
everyone fucking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I started reading what people are
talking about and then and then all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden I'm like, what the hell was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even just just discussing but you know it
um, they were asking you to do a what do
[SPEAKER_02]: you call those where when someone dies?
[SPEAKER_02]: On for I'm a chief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they wanted you to eulogy eulogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, Jaime was a Jaime was an
interesting cat, you know, I'll say that
[SPEAKER_03]: You know The old-timers like him the guys
in their 60s in their 70s a lot of times
[SPEAKER_03]: the stories they tell they don't come with
a lot of like a corroboration from others
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's like how much do you how much do
you take at face value and Not just him
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville said, you know Sam skunk man Mel
You can name tons of different folks,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know and and and so, you know,
he he was obviously a collector And you
[SPEAKER_03]: know he the last five or ten years or so
probably he started he started spreading
[SPEAKER_03]: his seeds out to lots of different people
You would say right you wanted a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different people to try his stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes You know, and he was pretty free with
sharing seeds with people or sending them
[SPEAKER_03]: things, you know I would say so there and
that's good in the sense that if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep his his work alive A lot of people
have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see if you know,
I'm sure it's already happening who starts
[SPEAKER_03]: to exploit The fact that he's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know But you know He I mean You
know, he claimed to have RKS.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the original DJ short according to
himself He claimed that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had a massive role in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that yeah and that he was the
real DJ short You know, he was the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that was actually responsible for creating
blueberry Yeah type and and he said his
[SPEAKER_03]: they called him DJ short Literally
literally DJ short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so, you know Yeah, he he was an
interesting character because obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he had a lot of claims It's you
know, it seemed like he was He was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing up there, you know Alaska and
spreading his seeds out and they all came
[SPEAKER_03]: with some wild stories And rest in peace
buddy Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just yeah, I mean, I'm glad he liked
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I glad he liked weed We all share that in
common rest in peace and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it wouldn't be the you know,
I could I mean, what do you what are you
[SPEAKER_03]: even supposed to say about comments like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we know The blueberry story to
be what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know and that would be like
somebody coming out and saying fuck this
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam skunk man guy He stole my skunk and
hayseeds and fled to Europe and I went to
[SPEAKER_03]: prison And everything that comes out of
his mouth is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah but you've got like this massive
amount of history of Assumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, which is that DJ did it so trying to
trying to Shift all that is a major.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a big shift That's a big but he
wasn't quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know, we just said it like
matter-of-fact So it's like how the how am
[SPEAKER_03]: I supposed to know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then there's also this thing too
where I think blueberry is a common enough
[SPEAKER_02]: name You know that the day short isn't I
Mean DJ short's not a common enough name
[SPEAKER_02]: and especially when you combine it with
blueberry it kind of means that one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them is not telling the truth and It's
just up to you guys to figure out who you
[SPEAKER_02]: believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean he was I mean, it's like I
don't know if he's I haven't listened to
[SPEAKER_03]: the to the interview He just did I have so
I don't know if he I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do that I don't know if you went
into depth on it or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but I Mean people are talking
about pre DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's blueberry out there that people
talk about 79 blueberry The people are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing You know, so who knows but you
know it one thing I'll always say about
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders is You know is uh, I always give
the advice of grow what you like Make
[SPEAKER_03]: things that you like, you know,
and then at the very least, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it You like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, which is the core thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jaime Did a bunch of work that he liked
and had a lot of big stories about it and
[SPEAKER_03]: started spreading them all out Yep You
know, I've never tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never grown any of his seeds to be
perfectly honest Oh Yumbolt, so he's the
[SPEAKER_02]: Yumbolt guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking sick, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have a reputation to leave behind
I mean Yumbolt was Yumbolt was one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: nicest things that Adam Dunn's when he
started th seeds had Was it was a sagar
[SPEAKER_02]: matha strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was a sagar matha strain
Yeah, and it and it was supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed representation of an old clone called
humble Maybe it's called a Yumbolt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Adam had a I mean those guys were
all tied together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might have used it Well, maybe they had
a different version or who knows who knows
[SPEAKER_03]: what who knows what the the thing so,
you know I'm not I'm not trying to you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, it's sad that he passed Motorcycles
are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, there's no there's nothing
protect.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no nothing protecting you right so
you could be an amazing biker and Someone
[SPEAKER_03]: else could do something dumb and you're
fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know it's fucking dangerous and
so but it you know it's it's a You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had a you know, he's given some
interviews and he spread out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: his seeds and stuff like that for Neville
one of the Yeah, I didn't want to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: all he said he was a backup for Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He worked under Neville He was the real DJ
short.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had real RKS That's a lot of big
claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is a lot of big claims and you
know, I always go back to like when people
[SPEAKER_02]: pass we tend to Sanctify them which you
know means declare them some sainthood You
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really bad personality where I
keep the same energy that I had when they
[SPEAKER_02]: were alive So I just say I wish that I
wish the guy in his family the best It's
[SPEAKER_02]: not fun to lose anyone and I know I have a
lot of friends in the community and I hope
[SPEAKER_02]: they all you know Pull together and and
and find a way through it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, hopefully people find things
that they like amongst his beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure And if you do keep them
alive keep them going You know and and and
[SPEAKER_03]: and figure and figure all that out,
you know I mean I have the same issue too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know with telling certain
stories, you know It's always hard with
[SPEAKER_03]: weed because there's certain people that
don't really want to be mentioned Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't want their stories told all that
much Yeah, and and but then maybe they
[SPEAKER_03]: played an important role in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's one person just for people
asking There's one person that we know for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure in the US that worked directly With
Neville at any level and it was at a very
[SPEAKER_02]: small level and that was Clyde Stevens So
anybody else making that claim it cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: be corroborated at all or even a little
bit Yeah, Clyde and Clyde was Neville's
[SPEAKER_03]: photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, and it's it's verified that Clyde
Neville went to Afghanistan together and
[SPEAKER_03]: also an operation green merchant They were
both kind of a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were both kind of a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a bunch of pictures There's
a lot of he was a photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of photographic evidence
of all that You know But you know what's
[SPEAKER_03]: what Matt and I always laugh about
Whenever we hear whether it's from Hawaii
[SPEAKER_03]: or Alaska or wherever that of course you
would pick Someone to back up your stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that lives on another continent In a
country where the DEA is trying to put you
[SPEAKER_03]: away for life in prison for decades on end
Yeah That is the most convenient place
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would try to back up all of your
stuff and do and do phenol hunting and
[SPEAKER_03]: testing and Conversations and be involved,
you know Rather than somebody down the
[SPEAKER_03]: street in Holland or somebody in in the
Netherlands somewhere or Europeans in
[SPEAKER_03]: general You know But then it was to say I
mean so there's aspects where there's
[SPEAKER_03]: certain stories that Matt and I know are
provably false Yeah, and then there's ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that like they have some parts where you
really wonder could they be you know If
[SPEAKER_03]: they're true or not, but you don't have
any proof One way or the other it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: the story, you know And in the interview,
I mean we can kind of bring this up now So
[SPEAKER_02]: we posted an interview on patreon for our
patreon subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an interview with a man named
Kevin Bjornsson and he was a major part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the northern lights crew He was a part of
operation green merchant I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: the story really is that he was green
merchant per se But I know he believes
[SPEAKER_02]: that story very deeply that he is the
reason for the season on it But we did
[SPEAKER_02]: post it and I wanted to get some feedback
from you guys and tell me from the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who listen what you guys thought about it
and I know one of the questions right now
[SPEAKER_02]: was was he the green merchant and I Do
know according to him that he did write
[SPEAKER_02]: down some license plate numbers from
people He says they weren't real but that
[SPEAKER_02]: was a part of the operation green merchant
bust so that What the the the basic story
[SPEAKER_03]: of green merchant so people that don't
know is in 1989 a Grow store got busted
[SPEAKER_03]: for being tied into weed and when they
were They rated it supposedly they found a
[SPEAKER_03]: series of Neville's catalogs With written
out orders and money and names and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then they realized okay that
Neville was selling millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: and seed To all these people all over
America Right and They freaked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because they had no idea this was
going on and supposedly even more so than
[SPEAKER_03]: that and this is that Neville actually did
this thing where he sent guys with
[SPEAKER_03]: suitcases full of wheat full of seeds to
America and Supposedly most of the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that he did were mailed from America.
[SPEAKER_03]: The money went to the money went to
Holland Yeah, I mean allegedly like
[SPEAKER_03]: allegedly and then I mean he's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's dead now, but no, he's so yeah,
no, no Yeah, and you know Neville had
[SPEAKER_03]: there was some Neville was mailing seeds
from within the US with a compatriot and
[SPEAKER_03]: then getting the money in Holland and No
one had any idea he was doing this because
[SPEAKER_03]: he was the first seed bank So nobody
really realized that there was anything
[SPEAKER_03]: going on and when green merchant when they
realized that people in grow stores were
[SPEAKER_03]: like buying and selling seeds Yeah,
and some of these stores were like buying
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of seeds and then selling them to
their customers with the lights They did
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing called operation green merchant
where they Rated every single hydroponic
[SPEAKER_03]: store in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah all at once all at once Same day same
time everything same day same time
[SPEAKER_03]: nationwide nationwide raid and the
gentleman that we did the interview with
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He owned a grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was tied into the whole Northern Lights
Pacific Northwest crew Right and had one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the only grow stores in that area one
of the first so he was one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: targets at the time and so that is sort of
the the the domino that when Matt
[SPEAKER_03]: interviewed Greg all the Northern Lights
crew got busted Yeah, like it was rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got customer lists.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got all kinds of things different
people snitched different people ratted on
[SPEAKER_03]: each other somebody at 1989 Yeah,
1989 operation green merchant happened
[SPEAKER_03]: every single hydroponic store in the
country It was rated same day same time
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they took a bunch of evidence
that they got from that and they took a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people That's what Matt was
saying was that they after They rated him
[SPEAKER_03]: they made the Jornson right down a bunch
of license plate numbers And it's
[SPEAKER_03]: debatable on whether he gave them real
ones or not He claims that he wrote down
[SPEAKER_03]: fake ones that were not related to the
grow store But they that was when people
[SPEAKER_03]: used to get scared like when I first
started growing We would always go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow store in a vehicle that a friend that
lived a clean life Yeah, and I would pay
[SPEAKER_03]: him Because we were always worried about
our license plate getting written down or
[SPEAKER_03]: a picture of the vehicle getting taken
with the license plate, you know because
[SPEAKER_03]: this had just happened and They used to
You know and because weed was totally
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's what got that's what got
Neville thrown into prison for a year
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and he was fighting extradition to
the United States and that's when he lost
[SPEAKER_03]: his his seed company because he had to
Sell it to the drunkers for them to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: for him to get out of jail and get back to
Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and You know and you know,
we thought about for a long time we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: we did that interview quite a long time
ago and we decided not to release it
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly because our Our general theme here
has sort of been like history and weed
[SPEAKER_03]: education and and weed people
bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and Most people don't know but I was
a I tried to be an active participant in
[SPEAKER_03]: that interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't get a word in The first
time he's ever been quiet For yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I think Matt got a couple of
words in a few sentences here and there
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it was basically like a mass
monologue from the dude Yeah, and while he
[SPEAKER_03]: has an immense amount of weed knowledge in
his head and an immense amount of stories
[SPEAKER_03]: He could tell from that time frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was much more interested in telling
stories of his wild youth and politics I
[SPEAKER_02]: think he thought the interview was more
about his life As opposed to what we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were hoping to sort of get a weed
centric One thing that we did get was that
[SPEAKER_03]: he did say didn't he say that the old g-13
and the UW Was sort of what was one in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I've got a few times in a few
other places So when I heard that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like what what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I mean he he I mean he was and
the reason why we interviewed him was
[SPEAKER_03]: because Greg Seattle Greg of NL NL fame
was like this guy was there He was around
[SPEAKER_03]: he was connected to all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one you need to talk to He's the
one that's gonna tell you everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one that you need to know He has
so much stuffed up in that head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then you know, it was about 45
seconds of actual weed info and Then a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of you know, crazy politics and
hookers and and this and that but there
[SPEAKER_03]: was some interesting Green Merchant stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Green Merchant stuff I thought
was interesting because he was really
[SPEAKER_03]: wrapped up in that he was one of the store
owners that was Raided by the feds and he
[SPEAKER_03]: basically admitted that he had to
cooperate with them To not go to prison
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but that he tried to fake all the
information they got so no one else got in
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble Yeah You know and You know,
so Who knows dude, yeah, right But yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know you dub being g-13 and adding
to that stuff Story and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he set up tons of growers He grew a bunch
of different strains back then and he
[SPEAKER_03]: probably could have chatted for an hour
and a half about just that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that really wasn't what interested
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just started Rap was a very
politically charged time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like I think it's right before the
election.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah Yeah, it was probably fresh in his
mind and he's yeah, he's older death in a
[SPEAKER_03]: retirement home I think or something like
that and so just to be able to talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: people You know, there was a lot there was
a lot of stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, there was a lot of stories
and so we didn't release it for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time because It was pretty light on week,
yeah You know, I was it was certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: colorful Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was as funny as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was certainly colorful I mean there was
an aspect to people like where he said he
[SPEAKER_03]: he he tested positive for cocaine Yeah to
his probation officer But it was only
[SPEAKER_03]: because he was eating out a hooker and he
thought like I mean he had some pretty it
[SPEAKER_03]: was uh It was it was yeah, it was um He
had some pretty crazy stories,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, yeah and You know and so but
that's but with that what that is is
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a really good indication of a lot
of these old old-time guys that you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk to you want them to just like dish
out an immense amount of lineage and
[SPEAKER_03]: specific history Yeah, and a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to get it out of that
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is it's not it's it's either don't
remember or they didn't write it down or
[SPEAKER_03]: You know DJ short was like that Yeah,
Greg was certainly like that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: start asking a bunch of specifics about
the various NL numbers That was hard if
[SPEAKER_02]: you go back and listen to that that first
interview with Greg It was me and my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend Konza at the time doing the
interview and he was not so much as
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in talking about the Past more
talking about the future and I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a lot, you know, I mean that's not
a lot are You know, it's like you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to diss who they are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but What you're really after is
like, you know, you're lucky if you play
[SPEAKER_03]: any kind of cool moment in history once
yeah Much less repeatedly, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you talk to some of these guys and it's
like they you know, like you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of knowledge and and information
that Ben and Alan Tronkers has oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure but they're terrible and
Everyone's told me you can't get jack shit
[SPEAKER_03]: out of them and they just tow the line
that their business is the exact same It's
[SPEAKER_03]: that like they don't they won't tell it
just doesn't matter I think I think also
[SPEAKER_02]: like just because they were there it
doesn't mean that they paid any attention
[SPEAKER_02]: at all to what was going on or Cared
enough to memorize anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're business dudes, you know,
yeah, they just it just wasn't it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: what they were into You know, I mean you
would think that like, you know that steep
[SPEAKER_03]: that that's Greg would remember a bunch of
stuff But he was basically just like oh
[SPEAKER_03]: the one and the two, you know,
he knew a couple things Yeah, and then he
[SPEAKER_03]: was like the rest was just a wild orgy of
sativas and different things We were
[SPEAKER_03]: trying and da da da da notes got you in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and you know I never made it
out like that just for people to know
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just never happened Yeah,
no nine got popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that no nine was a legend and
Neville sold it for like maybe one year as
[SPEAKER_03]: a hybrid to some other shit like maybe nl9
by skunk one or something Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it disappeared and nobody saw it
for 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but what I'm referring to is the nl9
from Greg that wasn't right that was
[SPEAKER_03]: passed Yeah No, and then and then all of a
sudden the net the name nl9 started
[SPEAKER_03]: showing up in Canadian seed banks Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah after like not not being around for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was one of those ones that like
Re-popped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know and Yeah, and so,
you know, there's there's parts of that
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's like people, you know Jaime
Kevin some of these old guys there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like that there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know weed people are kooky And a
lot of times we and a lot of times we are
[SPEAKER_03]: quirky and a lot of times we get quirkier
as we age I'm pretty fucking quirky
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't throw any shade Yeah,
you know, you're not even you're not even
[SPEAKER_03]: all that old yet, you know until you're
fucking cranky and and I know something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah No skunk two is interesting somebody
said my buddy had some skunk two from an
[SPEAKER_03]: old's heads, but he killed them all Yeah
skunk two was uh, I've been waiting for
[SPEAKER_03]: someone to pop up and say they have skunk
too Yeah, you know, it's it's it's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the I did hear there was there was someone
that I won't mention that that said They
[SPEAKER_03]: used to get it in the 90s in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really, you know, it did exist,
you know Yeah, it did it did exist,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it was it was a little it
was taken in a little different direction
[SPEAKER_03]: than skunk one, but it just I don't know
it seemed like That's another one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk six in Leadville somebody talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a totally different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a specific cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right and that cut And the MS and
the original MSS That my buddy got back
[SPEAKER_03]: east and brought west is the exact same
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes I believe it's lost and and as best we
know it was supposed to be what a super
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk hybrid of some sort Yeah,
I mean what we chatted with the guy who
[SPEAKER_03]: made it Skunk VAs mentor or whatever to
and he was a little light on details like
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of these old guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of a you know a rainbow cat or
whatever, but He talked about he got
[SPEAKER_03]: skunks from Neville and from Super City
the seed club for two or three years Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and bred them together and called it his
skunky skunk Yeah, right and then he took
[SPEAKER_03]: that and he crossed it to super skunk when
super skunk first came out and then that
[SPEAKER_03]: the skunk six or the super skunk that that
went to chem dog and math in mass from my
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy Who brought it west?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the same phenom of that dude's
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you know and then You know and then
there's a whole story behind that that guy
[SPEAKER_03]: had to go on the run for some Grateful
Dead related shit for a long time and it
[SPEAKER_03]: seemed like a bunch of people in Colorado
called it the skunk six and Our little
[SPEAKER_03]: crew in California just referred to it as
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes Both appear to be gone Yes Maybe you
know, I mean maybe I mean there's there's
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of rumor what it seems like
hat What happened is that there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: later stuff that's way more Afghan That's
called MSS that floats around
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts and that was pictured in the
high times later on That's very different
[SPEAKER_03]: looking than the original one It's
squatter more Afghan thicker All that and
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of people I think
that have it but don't have the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know there was a selection blaze
it Panda did from a was it was sour dub
[SPEAKER_02]: cross to reverse diesel that I had done
and He selected a phenom from it that was
[SPEAKER_02]: dead on identical looking to the the mass
super skunk shown in the high times chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog issue and that that has made the
rounds as Mass super itself and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to tell people that's not it,
but it don't matter I mean there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect to where it's like eventually
because it's just a legend of Almost
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone right because the percentage of
people out there that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately grew the cut is quite small
actually, right so Anything that has those
[SPEAKER_03]: turps or anything that could be plausibly
claimed we've already seen five or six
[SPEAKER_03]: years of Claims made without any proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep that people don't find anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a whole era there where
there's there's there's companies that put
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk on their logo real big on their logo
and they don't have any skunk and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, there's people that have ancient
skunk and old skunk and my skunk is the
[SPEAKER_03]: rare skunk that before the skunk got taken
out of the skunk and I don't have any weed
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, but this is the skunky skunk or oh
I got this real mss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna cross it to a bunch of stuff now
We're gonna sell all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find the skunk in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and You know and and it's like that
that You know, but I mean anybody that
[SPEAKER_03]: came up with anything smelling skunky
would be like that's kind of the goal
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what people are Missing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't think it's so much the
actual cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the lost turp Yeah for the
most part there's might be some bragging
[SPEAKER_03]: rights to the old cut or whatever But it's
it's basically more like like skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't smell like skunk and the closest
thing we have is real diesel The most most
[SPEAKER_02]: often when I see people pop up and say man
That shit smells skunky is after someone
[SPEAKER_02]: has burned and exhaled a bowl really loud
weed of any type of smell I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people Pop up and saying that smells
skunky after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like certain old sours You
get that weird nose crinkle sure and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not a pure super skunk nose, but it's kind
of on that same path Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like an analog of it or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a derivative.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know, it's a yeah it is it's a
feel and it's and they're and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: volatile too, you know, so so there's
hints out there of it and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got totally distracted by homies
comment You know, but we have talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville talked about like crossing some of
his or Shanti's old work together that had
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk in it and Trying to see if you'd get
recessives to pop up Yeah, and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's probably the way to get skunk is to
get cuts of things that you think have
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk in it and throw them on one another
and Hopefully, you know you get some
[SPEAKER_03]: recessives that pop Out because that's
probably what happened with our homies cut
[SPEAKER_02]: the sour dub by the reverse diesel Yeah,
and it crybaby seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it if you cross two of two
different phenos of or expressions of
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk that are like if you cross the
lanky Longer flowering sour type with one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the short stocky more mass super Mass
super v2 I should say types then usually
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna get something in there that's
popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty skunkier candy push Skunky,
it does seem like using out crosses to
[SPEAKER_03]: find it is a better way than s1a You know,
yeah, like it's got both of it in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you're just hoping for that thing
to combine Yeah, you know because it
[SPEAKER_03]: should combine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of It's just a matter
of doing a large enough populations sure
[SPEAKER_03]: You know and you could do a thing if you
could do traditional breeding you could do
[SPEAKER_03]: something where you got large enough
populations Where you could probably make
[SPEAKER_03]: make the the quantity of skunk go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to do on a garage-sized
scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah very You know I agree with homie
four-way is dutted The old-school four-way
[SPEAKER_03]: is dutted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shadow of its former self Yeah,
there's some liars out there that think
[SPEAKER_03]: their KNF and their various organic
treatments heal things Yeah, and while
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no doubt That you can make a plant
happier or unhappier based on your
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment of it That doesn't mean it's
gonna curative AIDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah People last night I do think it could
pop up in the LA Kush by Kendi And I do
[SPEAKER_03]: think that a lot of people a lot of people
are finding potency in it, but I would not
[SPEAKER_03]: be surprised I wouldn't be surprised
because the the LA is very diesel type and
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe they're super skunk and Kendi
although that's controversial Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but I also think crossing
different sours to each other D by sour
[SPEAKER_03]: headbands at least the the diesel
headbands, you know Yeah, we don't know if
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's asking we don't know if if if if
TC works There's some evidence that it
[SPEAKER_03]: does but there's also some there's I mean,
it's it's I don't know if there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of rumor that floats around
Yeah, and it gets mixed with fact A lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is You know, so it's not that
easy to figure I don't even know that we
[SPEAKER_03]: know the definitive answer to all this
stuff It probably needs more testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know Giveaway so start thinking
of how we're gonna give this away or a
[SPEAKER_02]: good competition or something I've got to
find something worth giving away though
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like something we probably
could have done off off camera,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll bring it I suppose And then
tissue culture just so people know Tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture is just a method of doing
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't cure jackshit Tissue culture
you can you can tissue culture and all
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing is cultivating a bunch of
small plantlets Yeah, right The tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture that people are talking about so
that actually might clean things up or
[SPEAKER_03]: like remove say like You know remnants of
various chemicals that you don't want is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually called Marist em tissue culture
and it's where you take cells from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Marist em and you regrow the whole plant
and it it It took you know, it can take up
[SPEAKER_03]: to a year to get that back and the
hormones are all nuts and out of whack for
[SPEAKER_03]: a while, too And we're not even sure that
it's the exact same plant So there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of aspects to Marist em culture that are
and it's expensive too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like four to six thousand bucks per
plant super expensive and Barely anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: can do it correctly, but a lot of people
will tell you they can So there's people
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's people like dark heart that
spread the dud all over the place That
[SPEAKER_03]: then offer tissue culture and heat
treatment that they claim kills the dud
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you hear from other other nurseries
and friends that you trust that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really kill the dud on a perfect level But
they're gonna charge you for it You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's a you know, there's a lot of
there's a lot of issues with it on that
[SPEAKER_03]: level And you know, the disease is getting
very prevalent And there's a lot of old
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that suffer from it There's even
rumor That I don't know that's proven that
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain percentage of seeds made from
dotted stuff The virus carries into the
[SPEAKER_03]: children into the beans Yeah, and I don't
think that's proven.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard as high as 50% and as low as
two or three percent Yeah, and I've heard
[SPEAKER_03]: various friends of mine including CSI and
others tell me that they've grown out
[SPEAKER_03]: testers and everything Looks fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think it's really hard to say
You know, I mean you could you could still
[SPEAKER_03]: have a virus inside of you that wouldn't
have it wouldn't have a physically visible
[SPEAKER_03]: level That's very true, you know,
yeah, so You know, so TC is thrown around
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty loosely the only PC that cleans
anything up to my knowledge is Maristan
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I understand it, you know And
Maristan basically like get mostly what it
[SPEAKER_03]: does really well is it will clean your
plant up if it was if Imichloroplite or
[SPEAKER_03]: added or a bunch of funk was used on it
Because those cells are taken from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Maristan not from the vascular system
Yeah, and so it's sort of like avoid the
[SPEAKER_03]: area of the plant that's contaminated and
you can grow it back But you know the the
[SPEAKER_03]: dudding or the you know, the the You know
the virus the viroid or whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: basically spread everywhere because when
everyone started getting clones from
[SPEAKER_03]: Dispensaries and everyone started getting
clones from certain nurseries and
[SPEAKER_03]: nurseries sort of became a clearing house
for a bunch of plants They spread it to
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands and thousands and thousands of
dollars or gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Yeah, you know and then once that
happened those gardens started spreading
[SPEAKER_03]: it to their friends You know and a lot of
times, you know back in the day you'd use
[SPEAKER_03]: a razor taking clones until it got dull
Yeah, you know and now you need to per
[SPEAKER_03]: plant you need to take a lot of different
you need to take a lot of different things
[SPEAKER_03]: into account and and that that one Viroc
viroid that causes dudding isn't the only
[SPEAKER_03]: dudding issue There's other diseases You
know TMV is the most famous one that
[SPEAKER_03]: everything anything wrong with weed for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, oh you got the TMV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah for sure and people used to think
that like the the Mosaic or the
[SPEAKER_03]: variegation that used to happen and chem
strains and other Afghans was a sure sign
[SPEAKER_03]: of TMV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, but I will say That if you
talk to tobacco people, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They do treat TMV extremely seriously and
they do they don't allow Harvest or you
[SPEAKER_03]: know people doing transplanting and
working on their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have a smoker in the home Yeah,
and you have to take off all your clothes
[SPEAKER_03]: and get and go through a process to get in
there so it does spread and You can
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely get it on your hands from
smoking cigarettes and you can pass it You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, but But there's there's pythium and
fusarium that are there's molds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's thyroids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's diseases and They mostly were were
minimal in the illegal 215 era sure and
[SPEAKER_03]: now they're all over the place You know,
so You know Yeah, I mean, yeah someone
[SPEAKER_03]: just said TMV can wipe out a whole tobacco
prop they do they take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: precautions even by touch, you know and
Someone said that you know Someone said
[SPEAKER_03]: that russets don't dud a plant out dudding
is what we call it russets can I suppose
[SPEAKER_03]: Lose you Oh, did you freeze there is my
back came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I freeze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I froze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know what the hell happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, there's there's a lot of
there's a lot of There's a lot of disease
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of there's a lot of stuff
out there that people didn't have to worry
[SPEAKER_03]: about before and as things have gotten
Commercialized and as things have gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: spread around You know, it's become what
it's become a way bigger issue And it
[SPEAKER_03]: would be easier If it would be easier if
it didn't transfer to see Not so pros am I
[SPEAKER_03]: back now, can you everyone hear me in real
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Think I can hear you you think I can
hear you in real time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah bad russet infestation can look like
a viroid You know and there's and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: rumors too that thrips and other and other
insects can spread Viroids or spread
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases like mosquitoes can spread You
know malaria and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so There's a lot of risks out there
There's a lot of risk out there that
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't do before in the 90s I didn't worry
about anything I'd never seen PM An
[SPEAKER_03]: occasional bug every now and again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: No diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries, but we've had friends that
have taken out their whole garden Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: lost irreplaceable and lost irreplaceable
shit You know, so Matt's over here in real
[SPEAKER_03]: time going through a seed collection and
then grunting to himself and all that so
[SPEAKER_02]: Really giving it his full attention right
now, I found some shit I didn't remember I
[SPEAKER_02]: had some old Afghani's and shit But it's
interesting people are talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: condoms or STDs and stuff like that like
You know, it's it's it's odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're obviously plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not Human beings but there is
some correlation between the various
[SPEAKER_03]: things that got spread around and the HIV
AIDS crisis yeah, and that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: something spreading that was harming and
People didn't know what it was and they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know what to test for it and they
didn't know how to take precautions about
[SPEAKER_03]: it And so it's spread like wildfire,
you know, yeah leafhoppers normally they
[SPEAKER_03]: they they pass this curly top beat virus
thing So there's a bunch of there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of diseases And some of them
probably existed for a while and like
[SPEAKER_03]: people just weren't getting the proper
testing because why would you help?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know because you're off your
you're in the in the shadows or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know and you know, they oh man,
I Just got totally distracted by
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna repeat it but but they But
yeah, they you know and and most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: time when people were trading cuttings Or
or you know or or selling their friends
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all within little circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know and it wasn't until the 215
era and these big centralized nurseries
[SPEAKER_03]: That things started getting spread all
over You know and then once it reaches a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain point it becomes really easy to
spread and then you're spreading it to
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends and you don't know what have
and then You know a lot of people would a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people would give up on creating
their own mothers And and making their own
[SPEAKER_03]: clones and they just be like fuck the veg
I'm just gonna go to wherever and buy 200
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts when it's time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know and uh Yeah, weird comment
at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I that's what that's what gets me into
trouble is it's hard to bullshit and read
[SPEAKER_03]: comments in real time when you read a
Comment out loud the other yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you read a comment out loud,
it's super offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, so you can get it's You can get
thrown off the game and so we made it we
[SPEAKER_03]: made it like an hour and a half without
actually talking about one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that uh, I don't think does pip have the
shoreline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't think we have some good friends of
ours that do and pips a good friend of
[SPEAKER_03]: ours, but I don't think he does I don't
think but we have we have some really
[SPEAKER_03]: close friends of ours that have had it for
quite some time and Jits fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't consider people tell me it's
not it's people ask if it's RKS I Would
[SPEAKER_03]: say it's skunky is from what everyone
tells me and it's got it's got rankiness
[SPEAKER_03]: to it But I wouldn't say that it's uh,
I'd say it's not sweet and then a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people confuse not sweet for roadkill scum
Yeah, if I was being a hundred If you're
[SPEAKER_03]: being a hundred percent, yeah,
you know, yeah Kim was selling chem for
[SPEAKER_03]: clones the other day at his Dispo and in
Massachusetts, I mean, you know Kim for is
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim for is the Kim for is probably the
most widely spread Kim Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely got spread out the largest
it throws really nice bats It's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the least hoarded of the one of all of it,
you know, it's still one of my faves too
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the Out of the cam for 91 or D I
prefer cam for for what I like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the most of the most people most
people's issues with Kim For is that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you can pull it at 10 So there's
a lot of people that pull it at 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense Tim for is not very
close to the D in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no Kim for is a big lanky long running
buds kind of hazy type of not hazy and in
[SPEAKER_03]: like when people think turpentine I just
mean like structure and it has kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: racy buzz do it and Do I think the
cannabis community is being an infiltrated
[SPEAKER_03]: to destroy home grows I think it's always
I think that's always been happening I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't I don't know that I don't know
that's never not happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's evident float how intense
it's been But I think home grows have
[SPEAKER_03]: always had Some issues and the main issue
I used to have with cam for is that in,
[SPEAKER_03]: California You can everyone wants you to
flush your weed immensely Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: but nobody wants a hint of yellow on
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because then they think you fucked
it up and then they want less right and
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim for a lot of times dries a Slight
light golden brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the golden the golden a little
golden color and that golden color is You
[SPEAKER_03]: know is bad people don't like the golden
color it can be fresh weed It can be
[SPEAKER_03]: sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be cured amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be fantastical and they'll get a
little hint.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be like Looking at the calyxes and
be like, uh You know, it's got a little
[SPEAKER_03]: hint of brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me uncomfortable You know and You
think of anything for a giveaway I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually been thinking about a giveaway,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been fucking talking shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you know you look down It's
called flow dog And I don't think I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think so cam for is a big tall rangy plant
Kim D is a much squatter Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's lighter green in a lot of
ways It's just this whole structure is
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Kim for and Kim D are very
similar at all You know And it doesn't it
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely doesn't take 84 days,
you know and what's interesting is we had
[SPEAKER_03]: our buddy pip actually take an 84 day
piece of chem for and lay it on top of a
[SPEAKER_03]: picture of Neville's 89 nl5 haze bud and
you could barely tell the difference Sure
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I do think there's haze and cam
for you know, I think that I think that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that it could be 91 by nl5 haze
maybe I don't know They're trying let's
[SPEAKER_03]: get back to skunk tons of people are
working on skunk lines, dude, it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're mostly not skunk Yeah,
and I always have to preface this because
[SPEAKER_02]: people every time I have to restart it and
say it When we say skunk we do not mean
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily skunk one What we're referring
to is the smell of a skunk when we say
[SPEAKER_02]: it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not saying oh, it's like skunk one
We're saying it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just just to preface that so people
don't confuse us saying skunk one for
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk They are two different things in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes skunk one is floral or citrus or maybe
a little cheese Maybe some grapes You know
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have any you know, what people
are talking about is archaea They want
[SPEAKER_03]: that rank nose curdling pure skunk spray
type of smell Yeah, you know and there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people, you know, we were supposed
to talk about about Breeding techniques
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never really got there People ask are
they working with there's not really very
[SPEAKER_03]: many lines being worked right now by very
many people you know most people are most
[SPEAKER_03]: people are doing the one-offs of things
they hope are skunky and Hoping you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: find skunk in them or just straight frauds
because there's now there's so many people
[SPEAKER_03]: that Want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of people jumping in
claiming to have it You know, yeah You
[SPEAKER_02]: can't they know that you can't tell them
they don't have it until X amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: months and most people will sit on them So
yeah, you know, I mean you can you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: through there's You know, there's people
like, you know blue or sky Vienna that
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking has their own story and they have
the skunkiest skunk that's ever skunked
[SPEAKER_03]: but nobody finds skunk in their beans and
You know, there's a bunch of people doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it that you know, there's not something
that's not there and There's a market
[SPEAKER_03]: demand for it and people are jumping in
and saying you're gonna get skunk for me
[SPEAKER_03]: any day Yep, you're gonna find this is
unbelievably skunky You're gonna find
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk in it and then they sell a bunch of
what you know, what do you people call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopium Hope you know hopium will be a
whole bunch of sell a bunch of addictive
[SPEAKER_02]: hopium, you know There were a few of us me
and me and Bodhi were working on just
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically finding That type of thy all
or smell in in old lines and he went one
[SPEAKER_02]: direction I think he went and looked in
some Afghani stew and I popped a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis looking for it and I got very
lucky and found something early on it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not the easiest thing to reproduce But I
found ways to reproduce it But by that
[SPEAKER_02]: point literally everyone had jumped on the
train selling skunk one of everything or
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids of skunk one everything and saying
it's skunky You had the blue skies Vienna
[SPEAKER_02]: people pick in and nobody wants to be
associated with that shit so some of us
[SPEAKER_02]: just said fuck it and walked away walked
away from it for good just because it's I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's easy to find now and I think if
you look in the right places, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to come across and I think it's out
there For people if they really really
[SPEAKER_03]: want it, you know Yeah, somebody's a skunk
lines over 9,000 skunk clones zero Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't know you'd be a
millionaire or whatever else because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like you could have a cutting that did it
but it's like you I mean, maybe you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe make a bunch of money I mean one of
the things like hand is cutting does it to
[SPEAKER_02]: a tee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you follow what CSI said
pretty pretty openly about the best way to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a skunky line to express skunky But
it's not Conducive to having skunky bud
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can carry around for a month and
sell it's just not gonna happen It's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very very volatile compounds You know
and and I think it's obviously got a
[SPEAKER_03]: recessive trait and it's one of those
things like people talk about People don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know this about genetics or whatever But
like I was talking about it the other
[SPEAKER_03]: night where blonde hair and blue eyes is
only like 11,000 years old in humanity
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a mutation right and it's a
recessive So if you don't if both parents
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have the recessive you can't have it
So you go to like Nordic countries or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that and there's a bunch of
it But they say eventually as people mix
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna get lost and it's almost never
gonna pop up because there's gonna be the
[SPEAKER_03]: the dominance are gonna be all over Yeah,
and I think that's what happened is in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s there was more there was more plants
that both had the recessive and So it
[SPEAKER_03]: could pop and be and be you know an
expressive trait and those things and then
[SPEAKER_03]: as it got bred out and people lost it and
it got bred with other things it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: became a recessive turp and Then you're
trying to look for it to pop right and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain smells that are very
dominant Turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah sure, you know citrus, you know,
you know a lot of times you can cross
[SPEAKER_03]: something and something like 70 or 80
percent of its progeny will have had to
[SPEAKER_03]: have that aroma strong sure and then other
times there's stuff where it's only gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: pop up in a limited population You know so
for instance to use the human example if
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got a bunch of Nordic people mating
Right like a bunch of Swedes or Finnish or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a bunch of blonde hair
blue-eyed kids Yeah, but if every
[SPEAKER_03]: generation they started like marrying
Africans or Mexicans or Chinese or
[SPEAKER_03]: something Within a certain number of
generations the blue eyes and blonde hair
[SPEAKER_03]: would go away or be a super rare thing to
catch up Yeah You know and we have a We
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't really studied which traits in
cannabis are recessive and dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we know is that we have no idea We
just have observational data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly Shared amongst friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any scientific basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have observations But if it was
dominant, it'd be easy to find Yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that's it and literally every single
person that has claimed that they were six
[SPEAKER_03]: or nine or twelve months away from
releasing perfect skunk to the community
[SPEAKER_03]: That was gonna change the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of it has ever happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet No, I mean that was that was what
that was Duke's claim to fame right when
[SPEAKER_03]: Dominion first came out He had a huge
skunk on the on all his shirts and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he was six months away from
walking in Skunk turps permanently from
[SPEAKER_03]: ancient skunk bluer sky Vienna all these
different folks, but then people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: find it in the beans No, it's hard and and
the the best advice I'll even I'll even
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat it for people that don't understand
and don't know A lot of the reason you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not gonna see it is because we grow weed
so much differently We cure differently we
[SPEAKER_02]: dry differently how quickly wet weed moves
doesn't happen anymore, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like people don't you're not buying wet
weed anymore There's a lot lot different
[SPEAKER_02]: going on than was back then and if people
kind of applied some of those techniques
[SPEAKER_02]: to it You'd see it pop up very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think too that all these techniques
that that He's talking about you can coke
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk out, but I do believe that there was
strains once upon a time Because people
[SPEAKER_03]: are talking about well, maybe we were just
confused No, no, I don't think that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just something that went away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah through prohibition and people
getting rid of it and changing changing
[SPEAKER_03]: eras You know, I mean imagine 20 years ago
You're fucking growing a bunch of skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and it smells rank skunk and you're
having a problem selling it And then your
[SPEAKER_03]: broker buddy is like dude, if you just
grow this Urkel you can sell every gram
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you stop selling skunk Yeah,
and you get rid of the skunk and you lose
[SPEAKER_03]: the skunk because you're growing Urkel and
then you move on from Urkel to Frickin
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush and then you move on from Kush to
sour and then you move on to skittles and
[SPEAKER_03]: then somewhere ten years later Somebody's
like, you know, oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we had some skunk But you got rid
of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one Yeah Never looked back and then it
was like not popular for long enough that
[SPEAKER_03]: when the time when everyone looked around
And was like where to go it was gone Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: people are asking when it showed up and I
think I think most people agree that
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever the Afghani started showing up in
California is when the skunk started
[SPEAKER_03]: popping up if You want to believe Sam
skunk man?
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll say that in the start of skunk one I
post you know that it popped up in most
[SPEAKER_03]: venos that it was dominant that you didn't
have to look for it It didn't matter if it
[SPEAKER_03]: was gross who it was grown by where it was
grown What nutrients you use they came out
[SPEAKER_03]: skunky and it does seem when we
interviewed Correll from Super Sativa seed
[SPEAKER_03]: club He said the first skunk seeds that he
got from Sam were much much much skunkier
[SPEAKER_03]: than what came later Yeah, and Neville got
those same seeds and You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the reason why the super skunk got
lost is because they lost the breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: male That threw those skunk turps,
you know And you know he they used that
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk male, you know and all kinds of
stuff And so I think it was prevalent in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 90s with a lot of those hybrids and
then times changed and it was I mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: grew that that old-school super skunk,
right and You know some people called the
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk six and it really was scary Yeah,
you know it made around your house smell
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculous for the last two weeks before
harvest It was even before you really had
[SPEAKER_03]: Carbon filters were really sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd have like the old like you have
an air like ozone generators Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'd run it you'd run the ozone
through like 30 40 feet of pipe and a coil
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you'd blow it out your house But
I used to pull up in summer and it smelled
[SPEAKER_03]: like dead skunks all around my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It was scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You worry about your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You worry about getting in trouble,
you know, people talk about it going
[SPEAKER_03]: through the bag Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what if it reeks like a dead skunk
for 50 yards?
[SPEAKER_03]: In every direction for your house for two
weeks out of every eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's sketchy People keep asking
about shoreline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned a little bit ago I got to try
outdoor shoreline and I thought it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well-grown the person who gave it
to be said it wasn't but he's very humble
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I got to try some indoor from
bitter that he had grown and I got I I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it smells like hot garbage Indoor
and then outdoors smelled a lot like real
[SPEAKER_02]: cat piss not turpentine, but real cat piss
ammonia Hot garbage so it's I mean it just
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on what your definition of skunk
is in my nose I put a lot of stuff up it
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was young so I don't smell things
certain smells I can't smell lemon and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of stuff that other people can so it's
hard to say it's hard to say yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean most of my most of my friends one
of the reasons why we we lost it was I
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't get anybody to help me back it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I believe it Yeah, you know because
people didn't want to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was risky and they were making good
money growing other things Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's how a lot of stuff will get
lost is like they'll be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, you know, you can hold on Yeah,
it's a lot of extra risk for not a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: extra bucks and then and then you're in
the and then you're in the spot where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like then it's one bust or one fire or one
mistake or one mishap away from losing it
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm, and then you start trying to hunt
it down, you know, somebody said the LA
[SPEAKER_03]: cushion chem D is pretty skunky That's
good that you found that I would not be
[SPEAKER_03]: surprised because I think both of those
strains have super Skunk in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would not be surprised on some
level to see Somewhere in there those
[SPEAKER_03]: those genes combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that kind of stuff to To come
back up, but you know, it's it's a numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: game You know, it's a numbers game Hobbs
breath Someone asked about the hogs breath
[SPEAKER_02]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It expresses very Afghani probably has
some skunk one in it I mean it has like a
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how you grow it slightly
cheesy to slightly sweet smell Foot funk
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably my best description of it
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people smell different things in it
It was said to be Williams wonder to
[SPEAKER_02]: northern lights to a northern lights back
cross It was all kinds of different things
[SPEAKER_02]: people said but probably if I had to guess
some sort of skunk one and l5 Maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: something Williams wonder maybe I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say Afghani Afghani skunk one
of some sort Yeah, so I mean it I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: think people there's a lot better Chance
for people to find it and some random cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: like our buddies You know panda that we
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah pop up It'd be another thing if that
person could actually take it that cut and
[SPEAKER_03]: then turn that into a line that people
would You know with at least with a
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable level of certainty find some
skunk in yeah Because that's that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: it all falls apart is to go like oh you're
gonna get some skunk soon And then all the
[SPEAKER_03]: beans they sell people don't find it Yeah
You know And you know, so You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they you know, and there's all kinds of
people saying oh, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've got that Oh, I've got amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be great if people did but Nobody's
really popped up with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean we even had that that that asshole
joint breath or whatever He fucking went
[SPEAKER_03]: to he went to like one of those Colorado
one of those Colorado cannabis shows and
[SPEAKER_03]: he got skunk spray from He did that the
Emerald Cup or whatever, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he went and got some scum spray aroma
from From you know, it's called Tinks
[SPEAKER_03]: think yeah from from the outdoor store,
you know hunting You know cabalas or
[SPEAKER_03]: something and and and rubbed it all over
his his jar Yeah, so that he could crack
[SPEAKER_03]: the jar and be like you want to buy my
seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is rank and then people would be
like, oh my god this just stinks and then
[SPEAKER_03]: they go to smell the bud and they could
And they it's like they could barely smell
[SPEAKER_03]: it cuz only a little bit of it had gotten
on there One of the people he let walk
[SPEAKER_02]: away with some buds of it and in their bag
was just this orange oil across the back
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta give a prop for actually doing
that a lot of people joke about doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: but that one actually he actually went for
it, you know, and And there's an aspect to
[SPEAKER_03]: where you know, they uh So yeah,
there's a bunch of people that have
[SPEAKER_03]: claimed it and I don't I like people talk
about I do believe that there's a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: make some things express skunkier than
they do But I also believe that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: some there's some plants out there that
have a straight skunk nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I find it hard to believe that anything
after a full dry and after a full cure is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna smell super stunky I just don't
think it can be captured like that based
[SPEAKER_03]: on what it is that old cut had it 100% it
Even even like super All right,
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean it would only last them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you it would only last You know
a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean anything and then eventually
But certainly like the first two three
[SPEAKER_03]: four weeks you had dry weed of it Yeah,
it reeked unbelievably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah 100% it didn't go away and so,
you know, I You know they I think it's Out
[SPEAKER_03]: there, but I think that the level of
breeding required to lock it in is not
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable enough To get people to
actually do the work To make it all
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And have everybody grow the same way
so express it the same way most because
[SPEAKER_03]: most breeding, you know, there's some we
have some friends like, you know archive
[SPEAKER_03]: or Kayla CSI or you know, there's Matt,
you know, we have some good friends that
[SPEAKER_03]: that that do multi-stage breeding But the
vast majority of breeding today is is
[SPEAKER_03]: one-offs and they move on to something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not super there's not they
don't take something and and like they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh I'm gonna make this thing and
then I'm gonna grow out a thousand of them
[SPEAKER_03]: or 500 of them or 200 of them and Select
and re-breed and it's almost all You know
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost all one-offs ST, you know
reversals and one-offs, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean how many people do you see
finding stuff within their own work and
[SPEAKER_03]: then using that in further work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's minimal minimal most most
common for someone to be like I reversed
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant onto these plants Here's the
names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the packaging My next drop will be
this other plant reversed onto these other
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and yeah, you know and so on and so
forth So, you know, I mean RC archive on
[SPEAKER_03]: here archive is one of the few people that
it's like oh I got these phenos that I
[SPEAKER_03]: made from my own stuff Yeah, and I'm gonna
work with it Matt's done that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: watch CSI do it on his page there's people
that do it it's not as profitable and So
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to find someone that's really gonna
take all the failure involved to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: find RKS Is probably rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Man indeed indeed Okay, let's do this
get this giveaway ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just I literally picked just like
four random things one's a blue bonnet mix
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a mixture of different whatever
like females in a mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 20 seeds in there or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm one's a Durban Yeti fuel hybrid
that I've released is something called
[SPEAKER_02]: project fruit was just fruity and I'm not
big on pretty but it was decent it had
[SPEAKER_02]: good yield one is The narrow leaf bubba
what I don't know if it was really an s1
[SPEAKER_02]: or if it was fucking Paul and Katam
probably Paul and Katam So we gotta give
[SPEAKER_02]: this away to someone I don't know how
we're gonna do it yet So what Matt doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: realize is I saved my Botox for there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually It's uh, it's probably
the best-looking part of you really so I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I have an idea I have an idea so
whoever gives whoever not so selects as
[SPEAKER_02]: the Funniest response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god the To the given genetics for
the strain called not so his old balls So
[SPEAKER_02]: not those old balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the genetics in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever has the the funniest or best
answer you'll get these four Someone in
[SPEAKER_02]: the USA that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not paying fucking 20 bucks to send
you seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not gonna happen the dumpster still
exists The dumpster still exists,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you know Cali Oh Is probably Cali Oh
by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's that's probably what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's what realistic is realistic,
you know, yes growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually plant-based should win me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean he just said scrotox Which yeah,
I don't know that might be that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: the winner yeah, scrotox is gonna be hard
to beat scrotox is really Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: boy, you know, but yeah, that's that's
That's that's how they look so smooth and
[SPEAKER_03]: young Most people wasted up most people
wasted on their face You know and on their
[SPEAKER_03]: forehead and they try to work on these
lines and stuff like that But yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that that's that's that's wasted
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a total waste You know,
so Indeed Indeed so they got the names
[SPEAKER_03]: that are gonna come in and fuck me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good one III think Joe cool
since scrotox first so Joe cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Joe cool it is Joe cool hit me up
after I'll make sure these go to you And
[SPEAKER_03]: then maybe we're getting close we're
getting we're getting close to the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: but maybe I'll do a rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah sure, so we were we almost got to
it earlier and then we got sidetracked and
[SPEAKER_03]: and Thrown not so firm is pretty good Not
so firm is also pretty good yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we were talking about like people were
asking a bunch of questions and You know
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think maybe just a brief like sort
of like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What people get with seeds has changed a
lot Yeah, so I was just talking now where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like really What it boils down to is
right now what you get is you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: like one-off hybrids That are sold and
they exist until the guy runs out of stock
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they're gone Yeah, that's that's
that's most of the industry right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: one-offs But you go back 25 30 years or
something and that was not how things were
[SPEAKER_03]: most seed companies sold lines Yeah,
okay, and there's a concept called You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, what's your floor?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your ceiling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right and what what that is is that it's
like is your seed line Does it have a high
[SPEAKER_03]: floor which where most of them are pretty
decent?
[SPEAKER_03]: But a low ceiling or you're not gonna find
any elite Yeah, or does it have like a low
[SPEAKER_03]: floor where you could get some true junk
and a bunch of mids but it actually has a
[SPEAKER_03]: high ceiling where you could get some true
elites mixed in there and People have this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea that in the 90s and all that in
Amsterdam like there was all this magical
[SPEAKER_03]: weed That's the weed that survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a lot of junk and there
was a lot of mids Right and back then it
[SPEAKER_03]: was better than Mexican so we People were
a lot more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Just random kind bud because all random
kind buds still sold because it wasn't so
[SPEAKER_03]: clone centric or anything like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had a situation where I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I don't know how to say
it I probably have bought 10 or 15 packs
[SPEAKER_03]: of sensei and l5 haze in the mid 90s So
that's probably I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I Didn't find an amazing keeper
Yeah, but yet there's pith and Cuban
[SPEAKER_03]: there's all these different named things
Yeah from those exact same seeds that are
[SPEAKER_03]: still around 30 years later and they're
the fucking bomb and they're still like
[SPEAKER_03]: competing with today's strains and they're
still competing with today's strains and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's certain old strains, you know that
stand the test of time and You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might run through five or six Well
today as Matt will tell you if you bought
[SPEAKER_03]: three or four packs of Matt's work and all
you found was junk and not a single keeper
[SPEAKER_03]: you would be fucking typing on your
keyboard and making his life miserable
[SPEAKER_03]: because You'd be fucking pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, there's a lot of pressure today to
have a high floor with your breeding So
[SPEAKER_03]: people will get stuff that is decent
enough that they won't bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and even back in the day 30 years
ago Neville used to Neville used to
[SPEAKER_03]: complain that He had these like,
you know Afghan by Afghan amazing hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that he wanted to release but if
people got ten or twenty percent less
[SPEAKER_03]: yield than the out crosses they bitch up a
storm Yeah, so breeders are always
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about What will sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's feasible you have to right and so
there's a lot of great weed that someone
[SPEAKER_03]: would be like this is amazing weed But it
herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I can't sell it because it'll be
just endless memes about me if you I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: all it takes is one customer posting one
good picture of One single plant herming
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's in like you can tell the
plants all burnt up and it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_02]: even if they could show That one time it
can ruin a line for good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it goes, you know So
there's a bunch of so there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit where if it herms it won't get
released If it's too leafy if it's too low
[SPEAKER_03]: yielding if it's to this if it's to that
it won't get released Yeah, right at least
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was a lot of there was a lot
of There was a lot of strains that never
[SPEAKER_03]: got released that they thought were killer
weed But they didn't meet commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right and now weed has to be fucking
pretty Yeah cookies on all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids have made ugly weed a really hard
sell So what it has what happens if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have some amazing tasting amazing effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of ugly weed that herms a little
Mm-hmm that weed is fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know like and they probably
won't get released But it's amazing But
[SPEAKER_03]: some pretty some pretty mids That will get
released every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you know the you know and and all
that and so You know, there's an aspect
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's like You know because more weed
was accepted in the 90s because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: better than Mexican It allowed a wide
variety of kinds of weed to flourish Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: It really allowed and and this whole
naming of clone thing has led to the same
[SPEAKER_03]: same getting grown by everybody and Then
that same weed gets crossed to everything
[SPEAKER_03]: and then everything's a blend of kush
mints and and Kush and cookie and this and
[SPEAKER_03]: that and skittles and da da da da da and
you know And people talk about purple
[SPEAKER_03]: punch purple punch has everything but hot
Yeah, but there's so many meds and now
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's now that there's modern
marketing and everybody has to have
[SPEAKER_03]: white-hot fire Yeah, there's I there's all
these things that I call midsy elites and
[SPEAKER_03]: then there's this thing where it's like If
it's not an elite and it's not junk and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even have a name For better than
meds, but not quite elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, we don't it's like junk meds
elite Yeah, three step process,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's things that fall on that
spectrum that don't have like I have weed
[SPEAKER_03]: that I really love and I'd be super bummed
if I lost it But I wouldn't consider it
[SPEAKER_03]: like in my top 10 or 15 cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah as far as like effect But I'd be
super bummed if I lost it You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are you thinking of specifically
right this second like the Maui?
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it Okay, just because just because
of like if you were gonna compare the
[SPEAKER_03]: Maui's high Yeah to say like my favorite
high is out there like an amazing nl5 hay
[SPEAKER_03]: spino or Chem 91 or Chem D or the
headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good Yeah, but is it frosty
and has amazing flavor and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know throws nice purple chunks and is
a great Yielder and like it has amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: features Yeah, but it's it's it doesn't
have any lead high, you know where to You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's an interesting anomaly Among
maybe Instagram weed today that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed is the chem 91 Because it's not
exceptionally pretty it is active.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask me, it's exceptionally ugly
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hardly It's very hard to take
good pictures of it and most of its value
[SPEAKER_02]: is in the high Yeah, and it's rare potency
and it's rare potency, which is something
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't convey in pictures yet still
today It's it sticks around and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: enough people That say it's some of the
best weed of all time Yeah, that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: group think there and people want to try
some of the best weed of all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah FOMO For sure, you know, but and a
lot of times the when it looks the
[SPEAKER_03]: prettiest is The people that cut it way
too early in my opinion, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like 53 or 55 days Yeah, if you take it
the full 70 plus or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks more ugly Yeah, but it works
really good skunk VA makes it look
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful when he grows it and I Never got
it to look like that It was always just
[SPEAKER_02]: even when I try to shut it down on light
hours like lower light hours Anything I
[SPEAKER_02]: would do would be endless white pistols
burn up ass fucking leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just look Well, you know one of
the things I'll say and maybe I'll bring
[SPEAKER_03]: up like some totally random shit like
Crockett DNA for a second Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things they did that was really
smart when they started selling all their
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry banana and all those hybrids
and they were blowing up the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_03]: is They grew out greenhouses of that weed
and then they got professional
[SPEAKER_03]: photographers with really good equipment
that understood lighting and understood
[SPEAKER_03]: all that and color to come out and take
jaw-droppingly beautiful shots And so that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes a difference too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you might be sitting there and be
like man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get a good picture of this Right
because you're not and I do the same thing
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be I'll take pictures of weed and
I'll be like I'm not that happy with it
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know But you get a professional
in there and they're like working on
[SPEAKER_03]: shutter speed and aperture and they know
the lighting and they have this they Have
[SPEAKER_03]: that and they'll make it look like a
million bucks You know, and so they were
[SPEAKER_03]: smart to like pay for professional
marketing Yeah by getting professional
[SPEAKER_02]: photos subcool was a master at that and
absolutely he had some of the prettiest
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking pictures back in the day Didn't
matter that it was all space queen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it didn't matter.

visual.
