[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get excited about starting a
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much opportunity, and many of
us have a whole lot of know-how that was
[SPEAKER_01]: hard-earned during the Prohibition era.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through our day creating great
products that we valued by people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they appreciate our efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of landmines that can
ruin our businesses, including capital
[SPEAKER_01]: shortages, bad crops, sketchy business
partners, and, of course, regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one problem that most people ignore
until they are blindsided by it,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, is trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark issues suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most people, trademark is an
unfamiliar boogeyman that we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know enough about to defend ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most folks just go forward on hearsay in a
sincere hope that no one else tries to use
[SPEAKER_01]: your business name and that we're not
using someone else's trademark as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with cannabis is that most
businesses are pulling their business and
[SPEAKER_01]: product names from a Prohibition-era
cannabis lexicon, which is very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we are already seeing, a business name
may be used once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: These companies may not even know each
other, because federal trademarks for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis are not yet allowed, simply using
the USPTO database is not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so disheartening when you find
out that you have a trademark issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both companies are usually very invested
in their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both have emotional attachment to their
name, and everyone involved is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to spend money to get it sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademarks are especially difficult in
cannabis, and if you want to avoid future
[SPEAKER_01]: pains, the time to trademark as much as
you can is right now.

[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about cannabis
trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Neil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you could make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, before we get into the
questions, I think we need to be clear
[SPEAKER_01]: from the outset that while you're going to
help make trademarks clearer today,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you are not giving legal advice and
the audience should be sure to do their
[SPEAKER_01]: own homework and talk to a trademark
attorney, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start at the point where most
folks first get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, today we're primarily going to
be talking about trademark and trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: is really commonly confused with copyright
and patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you clarify the differences
between copyright, patent and trademark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we start with patent law?
[SPEAKER_00]: So patents are essentially inventions,
a mechanical item or software.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can even be something like a design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, like the industrial
design of for the purpose of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bong or a water pipe has been patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a cannabis plant patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant patents are the third type of
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called Ecuadorian Sativa by
Steve Covey, currently owned by either
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush or Cannabis Sativa, a publicly traded
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're essentially useful inventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, copyright is the exact polar
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially creative work,
something like a book or music or a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now trademarks are different than the
other two in that they're a brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not about giving rights to the
creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about protecting the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with these three areas of
intellectual property, there are overlaps
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, a logo that's a nice
drawing or a nice image can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: protected as a creative work under
copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your central protection that you're
going to go for if you're using it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand is trademark law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what about something like a slogan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I wrote that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's copyright, but it's also
part of my logo-y kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's definitely a trademark because
it's a brand identifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where it divides for copyright is
copyright has to reach a requisite level
[SPEAKER_00]: of creativity, a modicum of creativity,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means a book reaches that level,
but a title of a book does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So short phrase is or sentences usually
are not protectable under copyright law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I've had that conversation informally
with so many people and you just nailed it
[SPEAKER_01]: in like two sentences what other people
muddle through for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so our trademark is our company name,
the names of our products, the logos and
[SPEAKER_01]: the symbols and slogans that represent our
company and our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need a separate trademark for each
of the products the company has on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there such thing as an umbrella
trademark that covers everything we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not generally, but there's a way to do an
umbrella protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start with company name?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a company name isn't in and of itself a
trademark unless you're using it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: source identifier, a source of the goods
and services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a common misconception is a trade name
is a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing they have in common is the
word trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade name is a DBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade name, fictitious name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really just what you write the
checks into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say, look, I protected
under a trade name, that's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: protection at all.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to both establish your name
with your business license or LLC and then
[SPEAKER_01]: go additionally and create protections for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use it as a brand of a
product, then trademarks can protect,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you mentioned, names slogans,
logos, they can even protect esoteric
[SPEAKER_00]: things like product packaging under what's
called trade dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors, as long as it's not indicative of
the product, a good example would be
[SPEAKER_00]: insulation, Pink Panther insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pink has no connection with what it does
or what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't get green for the color of
your cannabis flower, but if maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: dyed it a really weird color, then that
could become part of your trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of your overarching brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not recommending you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lion roar or the Intel sound could
also be protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because I would think
that each of those things had to be proven
[SPEAKER_01]: to the patent office when they were first
thought of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to a certain degree, your trademark is
kind of what you can get away with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or three methods of protection for
trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is common law, and that's just by
using it in commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some type of protection in the
region in which you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if let's say you're licensed in
Washington to sell cannabis, your brand
[SPEAKER_00]: protection or common law only extends to
those borders and not outside of that
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not selling in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first automatic,
in a sense, protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's state law protection,
which is really weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level trademark protection, but it's also
generally inexpensive in the states that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington allows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado allows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada allows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon allows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: California currently does not allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal is the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nationwide protection coast to
coast, and you have to get through the
[SPEAKER_00]: USPTO, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, and generally they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care for anything in violation of money
laundering or Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes a much higher barrier to get
that through.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could tell by your tone of voice that
there was a certain amount of humor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't prefer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I am really curious
to ask you straight up, is the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government giving any form of cannabis
trademarks yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they starting to squeak through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we seeing light kind of cracking
through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it still like zero tolerance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Controlled Substances Act has
a minimum THC required, and CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: considered an analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD also got recategorized by the DEA
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Trademark Office has gone back and
forth on saying, look, if it's CBD only,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you derive it from hemp,
we're going to let it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now there's been a little bit
more resistance than previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you can, sometimes you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have an idea of going for a
lifestyle brand or a smoking accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparel and creating at least a beachhead
for further expansion when we finally and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually and inevitably change the
scheduling of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that like refers back to my,
you know, your trademark is what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get away with or what you can prove,
because, you know, I've already started to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, you know, both clients and people
that my clients are competing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can't get their federal
trademark because these companies handle
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, which is still schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're like, they're trying to
find other sneaky ways to get some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: a trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're getting their trademark as
like a consulting company or as a t-shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: company or something that looks ancillary
that they will then blow up into a full
[SPEAKER_01]: federal trademark for a cannabis company
when it's allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are my clients fooling
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that actually buy them any
protection?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it buys some protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on how you're going to
enforce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the first thing you can do is
send a cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually get to court,
your claim is they're infringing my mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, are they, are they in the same area
of commerce that you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selling t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm also selling pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so you're saying that you're using
this trademark on an illegal good and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to enforce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it really depends what argument
you're going to formulate here and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what strategy you start with and you
carry through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a method of, generally it's
trademark infringement, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something else called trademark dilution
through tarnishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially you're using something that is
clearly not infringement, but it's harming
[SPEAKER_00]: my good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're, you're using it in an
immoral way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immoral way?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using it for an illegal drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you need to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're using it for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there goes that argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really just depends on the judge and
how you use the Lanham Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lanham Act is a federal law for
trademarks in order to enforce your mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that you really want to
develop the strategy of from the get-go
[SPEAKER_00]: and carry through that strategy the whole
time and know how you're going to enforce
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you want to have your arguments be
consistent in front of the court.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grok that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's tease out a little bit
more ancillary companies because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of people listening to the
show who have got licenses but a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to the show that are,
to use your example, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making bongs or something, something that
is involved in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but doesn't actually handle the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're technically not,
you know, they're not trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about these ancillary companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do they have the ability to get a
trademark at a federal level, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: their products are used for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they're a consulting firm and
their clients are all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as they're not handling the
plant, are they all good as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: feds go?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we look first at,
let's say, smoking articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's used for nicotine, we're going to
let it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If its main use is for cannabis,
well, no, it's paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have areas that get automatic
first amendment protection like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out a magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you really can't say somebody can't
put out high times and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a trademark on that because you really
aren't touching the plant here and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not used in order to break the law
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's gray areas here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consulting usually does work, but it
varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit card processing usually doesn't
work, but it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's all fact based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm getting from this,
Neil, is that there's quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: hustle in how to make this argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not cut and dry in how you
build your pitch to the USPTO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, well, we could go to
them with these four or five different
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one are we going to have our best
likelihood of success with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really the moment you should talk
to a trademark attorney is the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spend your first dollar on
marketing or advertising or you develop
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go a little off topic, one of my
biggest frustrations is that people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: creative with their brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to put words like 420 in there
and Mary, Mary Jane's what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and US cannabis and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from an advertising perspective,
it is not distinctive and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even worse, your consumer,
where are they buying your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in a cannabis shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do you really need the marijuana
leaf on your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're in a shop that only sells
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, heck that goes that goes along
with the bad ideas of the early days of
[SPEAKER_01]: especially medical in Washington and
California and Colorado, when people would
[SPEAKER_01]: take a pre-existing brand and then pervert
it, you know, just like they do on rave
[SPEAKER_01]: flyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic was the was the Mr. Goodbar
that was remade to be Mr. Dab Bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously, you're totally infringing
on the Nestle trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main defense I hear when people do
this, they say, look, it's parody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parity law is copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parody is designed for First Amendment
protection because you've got to parody
[SPEAKER_00]: the politician speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make political commentary
when it comes to trademark law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most attorneys will tell you parody
doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parity law exists in an extremely narrow
setting where you actually have to parody
[SPEAKER_00]: the product you're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only good example for this is a
company on the East Coast started a coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: brand or a type of coffee beans called
Charbucks and Starbucks came after them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they sued them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the court said, well, it is a parody
because they're obviously parodying
[SPEAKER_00]: Starbucks and Starbucks over roasts their
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably should have been pursued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty bad for Starbucks,
but it showed that you weren't just
[SPEAKER_00]: parodying the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the butt of the joke was who you were
parodying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good time to point
out, too, that a lot of these folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, coming up with these plays
on a pre-existing company's names,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these companies like Starbucks,
they have got to defend their trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: because whether or not you defend your
trademark over time is actually a point of
[SPEAKER_01]: fact when you go in front of a judge that
if you if you're lax nine times out of 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then the 10th one you want to enforce,
the judge is going to go, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not protecting your trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, if you are a trademark holder,
you have to go after everybody.
Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're you're absolutely right to some
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called policing your trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't police it, if you don't
stop infringers, from a broad level,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't try, then you're obviously
saying or you're saying to consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care whether or not, you know,
it's my products are being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weakens the trademark that can be
used to invalidate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the level of policing isn't
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the courts have looked at it,
as they've said, you have to police it
[SPEAKER_00]: within your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're somebody like Starbucks,
your job is to police it and go after
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a smaller consumer,
you don't have to go after everybody if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have to make an effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's I can totally imagine
that there's somebody listening going,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, hell, yeah, right now, because there's
so many small shops right now in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: who are afraid of taking on big guys and
they're afraid of the future and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: afraid of the corporatization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, so long as they are being
responsible and trademarking as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: they can, perhaps they can hold their own
with the big boys going into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's talk about the future before
we before we go to our first commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, eventually the federal
trademarks will become legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that looks like politically,
you know, one can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, normalization will come
around federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you imagine it's going
to look like when suddenly the gates are
[SPEAKER_01]: open at the federal level?
[SPEAKER_01]: What will be the the threshold moment that
says that cannabis trademarks are
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you imagine they will be
determined who gets the mark and who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, you know, there are
companies in Colorado, California and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington who have got the same name
locally, and they're all going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: applying to the Fed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I'm asking you to kind of look
into your crystal ball a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but just give me what you got based on
your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as that goes, I mean, there'll be a
race to the trademark office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at first use in
commerce is going to be one of the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be where you're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of lawsuits,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been debate on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the USPTO has 45 classes of goods and
services from entertainment to apparel to
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting to smoking articles to
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do this is to create a
cannabis class.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't do that because we use
international class systems from Nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: from basically the world national property
organization under the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're probably going to allow you to
get one in apparel, one in food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three classes for food items,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have a big brand name in
edibles and somebody else has it in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're right next to each other on
the shelf with the same brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of I think
infringement suits will come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's I mean, I know that you
don't necessarily want people to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting because I know you're pro
cannabis and you know, you like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, it sounds like your
field of cannabis, you know, trademark and
[SPEAKER_01]: patent and copyright is a growing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best way that people can avoid
this is by looking for really arbitrary
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive marks that are unlike anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I can start a computer
company and I can call it computer
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are us or international business
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can just pick up a name that has
nothing to do with computers like Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody else is out there because
nobody else's name of their computer after
[SPEAKER_00]: a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be good while I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be distinctive and know what no
other brands are going to be anything
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, that's that I actually went
through that exercise when coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: the name for the podcast shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is odd words that that feel good
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea behind the brand was always
that, you know, we've got this this fast
[SPEAKER_01]: burning entrepreneurial activity and way
to heal people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's kind of going wild and and
and and how do we shape it so it can have
[SPEAKER_01]: more meaning to humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: And but you put them together shaping fire
doesn't doesn't really mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess that's how you get like
computer companies, you know, purple polar
[SPEAKER_01]: penguin and things like this, people who
are just making things that are so unique
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's there's no chance that it's
going to compete with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five strengths of trademarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to go for the top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours would fall under the third one or
the third of five, which is inherently
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called being suggestive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's suggestive of what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know what it is that you're
providing with just shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you hear about it, you get an
understanding of it like, oh, I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of encapsulates this or it addresses
a particular attribute of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's suggestive like Greyhound.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a bus company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're trying to say it's a fast bus
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next level up is arbitrary like Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next level up is fanciful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made up the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the dictionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way anybody else could have it
because I made it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your strongest level of
trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody who's not familiar with at
the cornerstone of that example,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, is Xerox, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They made up this word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone knows exactly what you're
talking about when you say Xerox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Xerox actually almost went down to
what we call the Xerox effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you become so central to the product
group that people are now using your term
[SPEAKER_00]: as a verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to photocopy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just Xerox it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once it starts to be known as the
overall term, it loses its ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: protectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Kleenex would be another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hand me a Kleenex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's Puffs, you're handing me a
Kleenex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevator was a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was escalator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was lost because it just became the
generic term for what the device was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is attorney Neil
Gineja, founder and managing partner at
[SPEAKER_01]: Gleam Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processing
[SPEAKER_01]: processes to do just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the expanded Eden team has been
designing and building industry leading
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions for cannabis extraction ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options, including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you're buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braddock talk about the company values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'll be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Ford slash Eden to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know though, that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_01]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays I find that people prefer just to
be spoken to calmly, accurately and with
[SPEAKER_01]: good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later,
[SPEAKER_01]: will hear about your company again and
again for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is attorney Neil
Gineja, founder and managing partner at
[SPEAKER_01]: Gleam Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
what a trademark is, what a trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually we talked about several of
the challenges to trademarks and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: might wanna think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we're pretty clear on that,
let's talk about how actually to get one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have helped clients with their
attorneys do this and I've looked into
[SPEAKER_01]: this for myself and taken some steps in
the direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no question that it's got a
secret vocabulary, the USPTO website.
[SPEAKER_01]: While not impossible, there's so much
information there, it can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neil, for our entrepreneurs who are
listening, what is the first step that a
[SPEAKER_01]: business owner should take when moving
forward to trademark their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, first we did go over this
before, but make sure it's a distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work with your branding people,
work with your marketing department,
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising department, make sure you have
something that really is worth protecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My general rule of thumb is if you hear
the brand, you should not know what
[SPEAKER_00]: product it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you do, either it kinda works
with that or it has no connection to that
[SPEAKER_00]: like Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, let's say we wanna go for a
federal trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're gonna wanna do a clearance
search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically searching all
applications and registrations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually good to do a broader
search and just look at all uses in
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: First level clearance search is called a
knockout search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go to the USPTO website and you go
to the test, the T-E-S-S, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark electronic search service or
something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you type it in, you do a simple search
and see what comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you analyze that and you can look
at what classes other applications
[SPEAKER_00]: registrations are in or how common it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you wanna do what we call a
thorough clearance search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what this search will do, and every
firm or search firm will have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms on how they feel it's satisfied
and we have our own proprietary algorithms
[SPEAKER_00]: too we've developed over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking for is anything
likely to cause consumer confusion and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is likely to cause consumer
confusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, things that are spelled differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different words that may sound the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first word is the dominant word in
most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhymes may fit in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole breadth of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason you're looking for this is
you don't wanna go through the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process and six months from now be dead in
the water and you already have your
[SPEAKER_00]: product on the shelves and you realize,
I now have to change my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come down to it, the main two
reasons to register a trademark are one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanna know when you're using it in
commerce that nobody's gonna come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the woodwork and say, you're infringing my
brand, you need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you've lost all the goodwill,
all the reputation, everything that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for is in that brand and it's gone
and you have to start from square one
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second reason to do this is so you can
do it to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stop others from using a mark
like yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two main reasons the way
I break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you complete your thorough
search, you know what obstacles are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the lay of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how broad your protection can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that works is if it's a clear
and open field, your protection isn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: in one of those 45 classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can expand beyond that without even
registering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's reasonably foreseeable that you
would expand into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a very crowded field,
you may be able to wedge it in on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the classes, but you're not gonna be able
to expand to other markets, other classes
[SPEAKER_00]: of goods and services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to know,
especially when you're looking at long
[SPEAKER_00]: distance, where your company may go and
whether that brand may be able to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to use the Apple example,
Apple Music exists in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Apple went with iTunes and
invented the iPod, that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could do Apple Music here,
but not in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really hampered their ability to
move forward in that market under that
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanna talk about the form for just a
second because it is a pretty easy form to
[SPEAKER_01]: use because I know that people are gonna
be going from this podcast and Googling
[SPEAKER_01]: USPTO and coming to their splash page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna just encourage folks because I've
been through this myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get to the USPTO office,
it gives you a whole bunch of legalese
[SPEAKER_01]: vocabulary about how and why trademarks
work and what their database means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all seems very, very heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a little bright colored
link that says, if you've already read all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this and you'd like to go right to the
search form, please click here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly you're eventually gonna
wanna read that or better yet be working
[SPEAKER_01]: with an attorney so that they can
translate it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But feel free to just click that damn link
and get beyond all the legalese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because mostly what you wanna do the first
time you are considering a name for your
[SPEAKER_01]: company and you wanna run a search,
you just wanna make sure there's not 8,000
[SPEAKER_01]: other companies that are also playing with
the same name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so go ahead and click the go right to
the form and then you'll see all these
[SPEAKER_01]: dropdown menus for all these different
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to just put your word or
three in the box and hit search and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: come back with totally valid results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing how many clients I've worked
with who felt this was very imposing
[SPEAKER_01]: because the US Trade and Patent Office is
imposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, just push through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The form's bark is a lot worse than its
bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Neil, what happens if I put in the
name of my company or the new product name
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm planning on using and,
oh my God, other companies come up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from that point, so there's three
types of searches on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the simple, structured and free
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably using a simple search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the structured, you could do a
little bit more complicated stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the free form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost Boolean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's Boolean but it's not the same
syntax as Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll wanna actually Google,
notice how I'm using the brand as a verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that works with Google is we
all know it's the Google search engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to bing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll wanna Google different methods
of search syntax to really get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do this and it comes up with,
let's say, 50 results, the key is to
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how close they resemble what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be likely to cause consumer
confusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the legal test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the file wrapper or the
prosecution history and say, how did the
[SPEAKER_00]: examiner treat this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they find reasons to reject this for
consumer confusion issues or something
[SPEAKER_00]: else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're able to start to get a picture
of whether or not you may be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it through the trademark office's whole
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, I think at that point,
you'd probably wanna talk to a lawyer that
[SPEAKER_00]: has experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I can glance at our analysis
and know what actually is gonna be an
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacle out of our searches of my guys
will give me 100 of them with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just be able to look at that two
page readout and say, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have one that's gonna be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is definitely some growth with
the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say you decide to proceed on or
you say, screw it, I'm just gonna file it
[SPEAKER_00]: and just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual form that you enter into is
pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has hotlinks on it that go to the TMEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the Trademark Manual of
Examination Procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bulky book that the examiners use
in order to know if your trademark should
[SPEAKER_00]: go through or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of that is it hotlinks you
to every regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every word of the code is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives you the case sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say, why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's a case right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do legal research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go into the case and look at
the legal holding, the rule that is
[SPEAKER_00]: applied and say, well, I fit within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can argue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you fill out the form and
you just follow the process, file it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to four months later, roughly,
an examiner will pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll allow it to go through or they'll
reject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they reject it, you get an office
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have six months to respond and you
respond, Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is why it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm just going to ignore it because I
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, likelihood of consumer
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you argue with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you're looking at this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you know, this isn't the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I approached that guy that you said
I'm conflicting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me a document that says it's
OK, which is absolutely one method to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A coexistence agreement, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take that back to the examiner and
say, I guess it's likely to cause consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion, but they said it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are ways you can get through the
examiner's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get through that,
then the next step is they publish it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the official Gazette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every two weeks, roughly, I think
exactly, they used to put out this
[SPEAKER_00]: dictionary-sized book with every
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would pay their attorneys to
read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every two weeks, they'd just leaf
through this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now, fortunately, it's digital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just download it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a third party can oppose your
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, we've had a couple
Fortune 50 step in and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is too close to our mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, you can either fight them
in what's called the TTAB, the Trademark
[SPEAKER_00]: Trial and Appeals Board, which is
essentially an online litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can submit everything online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to get up out of your desk
or put on pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am wearing pants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be perfect to litigate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how hard is it to engage with those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, for example, you said Fortune 50,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of folks, they just feel
that so much of US law is who's got the
[SPEAKER_01]: most expensive attorneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is trademark law a pretty flat playing
field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are all of our fears warranted?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one against a Fortune 50 company a
few years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made a couple of strategic
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, we were able to get more
and more leverage on them in negotiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a minor change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they allowed us to keep using the
brand on so many items every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really a bit more than they
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were allowed to continue using a
brand that they said it was infringing for
[SPEAKER_00]: limited use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made a minor change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let it go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in another case that we're dealing
with right now, they're not budging an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the client just can't afford the
expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, they really just have to
change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's a huge difference now
than three years ago as well, because now
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the large companies are eyeing the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by saying, look, we're only going to
use it in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may have flown a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody knows that's a valid market
to expand into someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want to handicap themselves
at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some negotiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's negotiable in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some negotiations with the
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just depends which company it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go back to when you were giving
instructions about using the form on the
[SPEAKER_01]: USPTO website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave an example of a bunch of names
coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your team would give them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd scan through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd see the one out of the,
I think you said 40 or 50, that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to kind of highlight that,
because it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because coming up with a good name is
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have worked with clients for,
heck, 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 20 years, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years now on naming their companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people get so emotional.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're emotionally connected to their
first name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's say that there's an
entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really connected to their
first name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they run it at the USPTO database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes back with all of these
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important for us to say, do not give
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are ways that even though
other people are playing with your name,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be doing it so far away from
your industry that you can still make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's where it comes into a little
bit of a little pain point is,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say there's a lot out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say we can get through the
trademark office.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you have a registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not original, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really in line with a lot of other
names that are out there that are brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it lowers your ability to have a very
strong brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least it lowers it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some options are to go for it and just
continue marketing it and be fine with it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can get it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is something I coined,
or I'm trying to coin a trademark or
[SPEAKER_00]: goodwill transference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to come up with a better name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically taking your brand
that's already out there and converting it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a new brand through slow education of
your consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm US cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to change it to Elbot or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's US cannabis's Elbot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use them together for a period of
time until it's indistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can drop the US cannabis,
for instance, and Elbot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know why I came up with that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elbot becomes your new brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumers are never confused and
know it's the same source of goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get ahead of it,
you can sit there and spend the time in
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing or just selling your products,
converting it over to a brand that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still be in love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have Elbot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who would be in love with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't come up with a good example right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have seen this many times over the
years after mergers and acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take the company that's going to be
the primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they put that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that happened with Steep Hill,
I think, in our own industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they either merged or bought out
or something, Steep Hill Halent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they dropped the Halent after a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when all of that goodwill was
transferred to Steep Hill, I may not have
[SPEAKER_01]: the story right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, with mergers and
acquisitions, I think that that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really the good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the real key here is, I mean,
especially in cannabis, well, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: in every industry just about, is your
brand is your most valuable asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how customers know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get a return sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you have to protect more
than anything else, except your
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you do, if you lose your
brand, nobody will ever be able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to start from square one in a
sea of hyper-competitive competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an understatement, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the break, we're going to come
back and we're going to talk about what to
[SPEAKER_01]: do once you have your trademark and how to
defend it from all the people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come after you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest today is attorney Neil
Gineja, founder and managing partner at
[SPEAKER_01]: GleamLaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like podcasts like Shaping Fire,
chances are that you'll like audiobooks

[SPEAKER_01]: Just like with podcasts, audiobooks speak
to you, tell you stories and teach you
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.

[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash
audible to find out more or just click on
[SPEAKER_01]: the link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding principals Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on three
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: just does not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic, and trackable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash Blunt
Branding to find out more.

newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is attorney Neil Gineja,
[SPEAKER_01]: founder and managing partner at Gleam Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
how to both secure and why you want a
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're going to talk about what
happens after you get your trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neil, after I get my trademark,
what's my level of flexibility with my
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I able to license that to other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I adjust it a little bit as I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: How locked in am I to a trademark,
and what can I do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first step is people want to know
why or when you can put the TM or the
[SPEAKER_00]: circle R.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell everybody right now,
put a TM on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all the little TM says is I'm
holding this out as a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting you on notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider this to be my trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put it on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not it's valid, there's no real
legal basis or it really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if you put it next to the word
cannabis, I don't think anybody's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually have a federal
registration, you can start using the
[SPEAKER_00]: circle R.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called SM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's TM for trademarks, SM for
service marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use SM for service, but it's not
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: TM is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rationale being that SM may have a
derogatory connotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let your imaginations work fine with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you license it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can license it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll license it with the goodwill and
you'll have a proper agreement in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the requirements and one that
is often missed is you can't do what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called naked licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So naked licensing is I'm going to license
out my trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go use it for whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why this isn't permitted is
the consumer is harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from a case in the Ninth
Circuit, Washington, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a wine company that just
licensed their brand to another wine
[SPEAKER_00]: company and then they got sued.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the defender, I'm sorry, they sued
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the defender said, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even treating your trademark as
it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked at the licensing agreement
and they said, they're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just told somebody to use their
trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if it's the same quality of
goods or if they're even maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another company putting random
red fluid in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they lost their trademark and they lost
it after they tried to sue somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might've been a bad move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to do what's called a
naked license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have quality control
provisions in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with cannabis rules, some of the
regulations don't allow too much control
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be really careful how you
write those and satisfy both trademark law
[SPEAKER_00]: and your cannabis regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Washington in particular has been a
really difficult one because we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: allow easy payments for royalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just fixed that in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislation did a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll start to be easier in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty okay in most other States as
far as cannabis goes, but really look at
[SPEAKER_00]: those laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you make changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's, when we talked earlier
about your name, your slogan, your logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your name and your slogan are two
different marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a word mark and you could have a
design mark, which includes your logo,
[SPEAKER_00]: your colors, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend filing your mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your trademark application in black and
white, because then it's all colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be some changes, but you
really don't want to change the word mark
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're adding other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be changed substantially,
you should probably apply for a new mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's really how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listening to you as a brand
strategist, which is my main shtick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it was funny because you said
when you get to add the TM, SM or R to
[SPEAKER_01]: your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I never want to add the TM
because it's visually distracting and not
[SPEAKER_01]: as pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I would love to be able to
have my trademark and never have to put
[SPEAKER_01]: the damn TM on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, you know, I've always been
told that you've got to have the TM to
[SPEAKER_01]: alert all humans everywhere that I have a
trademark name.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the truth behind that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I actually have to use that trademark,
the TM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a trademark attorney will tell you,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the same, but I don't use it
for gleam law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a registered trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts the entire simple look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, where this really comes into
play primarily is on enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get to damages, it's non-willful
versus willful infringement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge difference in terms of
damages, but when you sue somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get to damages in most scenarios
because you're suing to get them to cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist their infringing mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a clear case, they're going to
cease and desist after you, preferably
[SPEAKER_00]: before you file, but after you file as
you're suing them and you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, I'm going to drop the case because
why am I going to spend more money to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to damages?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So willful, non-willful matters a bit
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where something in like copyright,
you're going to go for damages as fast as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, and you're going to ask for
settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In trademark, you're going to say,
look, I won.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't come as much in play as
it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend using the TM or
CircleR, but I can see exceptions to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: including myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me of those folks who
are using the legal system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And software patents to just capture,
troll, and sue people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to capture, troll,
and sue people for trademark, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put TM on everything so that you can go
after their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if really you're just in it to protect
your brand, and we all know that your logo
[SPEAKER_01]: or your company name looks better without
the TM, you don't really, it's not a 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that's, that's reassuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least, you know, put it at the
bottom of the website, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this, and this are registered
trademarks of this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Coca-Cola, I think uses the
CircleR, but they also say on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: their can, you know, this is a registered
trademark of the Coca-Cola company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, put it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do recommend using the CircleR
when you get a registered trademark,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I could see exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, throw it on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to put it on the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens if I see someone using the
name that I have trademarked?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the action that I take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them a cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gone through every type of cease
and desist letter in terms of tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a beautiful one by Jack
Daniels that sent a letter to this woman
[SPEAKER_00]: that was using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, maybe it was a guy and
they're like, look, you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you a limited license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're even going to pay to help you design
your next logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gone and tried every kind of tone
from, Hey, we get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're happy to give you time to,
Hey, we're going to come and kill your
[SPEAKER_00]: firstborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, the nicer you are,
the faster they are to lawyer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of have to be stern and mean and
threaten to come over to their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part is definitely not legal
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you send them a cease and
desist letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You prep for litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You expect them to back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is an industry of
fighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry has been disobeying the law
for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more likely to fight regardless of
what the legal basis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to get ready for
litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: State litigation is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There hasn't been any federal litigation
on cannabis marks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to be able to get a
federal trademark through for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Lanham Act, the federal law I
mentioned earlier, does allow you to use
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law for common law trademarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you think the first thing a federal
judge is going to do is throw it out for
[SPEAKER_00]: illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't seen this litigation yet,
but it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen state litigation and I
haven't seen one of the state litigation
[SPEAKER_00]: cases actually be determined on its
merits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the judges were more than happy to
hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more likely than not, you still have
state trademark law as well for statewide
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first direction you'd go
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you file that lawsuit,
they should back down if you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's flip that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that it's not me sending the
cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that I receive the cease and
desist letter after I open it and my
[SPEAKER_01]: adrenaline spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is my response to receiving such a
letter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, you've got to figure out
whether or not there's a legal basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they being a bully or are they right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some as far as bullying is
going right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No names, but there's a California company
that really shouldn't have a valid
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's never going to hold if somebody
stands up to them, but nobody has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not valid, well, then it
depends what you want to do as far as your
[SPEAKER_00]: resources go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to fight it and validate their
trademark in the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also a negotiating point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will invalidate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your trademark attorney, your litigating
attorney knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better just back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they really do have a valid
argument, well, you should probably work
[SPEAKER_00]: with them to say, look, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to give us some time here to
convert over to a new brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us six months to work this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sign the paperwork that says we
won't infringe again, and we'll be good,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that usually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six months is a reasonable period of
time, depending on what the product is,
[SPEAKER_00]: to phase out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's good to point out,
too, that just because somebody says that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to stop using a name because
they control it does not mean it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of my clients has got a legit
company here in the States, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: received a cease and desist from a company
with the same name in Canada that was all
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthy and pushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a different country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they sent back a strong and
well-thought-out reason why, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, F you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they never heard from them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important for people to
realize that just because you get a cease
[SPEAKER_01]: and desist letter does not mean that you
should just throw your hands up in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: and give up, that there's plenty of room
to defend your turf, even if you do don't
[SPEAKER_01]: hold a trademark yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A common law mark, like I said earlier,
is good in which the region it's used,
[SPEAKER_00]: the geographic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have two common law marks in
two different states that are both valid
[SPEAKER_00]: and can't stop the other one from using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as from a little earlier,
what do you do when you receive a cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist letter?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a third option, and that's to go
to them and say, well, maybe I am
[SPEAKER_00]: infringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I license it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that was pretty much the only
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get money out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may actually do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as Canada goes, they just recently
joined the Madrid Protocol, which is under
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they used to be part of a
different trademark system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can use the Madrid Protocol to
register the mark in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce over to the Madrid Protocol,
then shoot out to a number of other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries for registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is not one of those countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the majority of countries on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Brazil is yet, but basically
almost every country is now covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay in Swiss francs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets very expensive if you're doing 20
countries, but it's a method of
[SPEAKER_00]: registering internationally pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Canada, that's a method to do it with
them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny that you're saying that they
they pay in Swiss francs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's so international.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain was like running along with your
sentence and I was waiting for you to say
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're probably a little a little
early for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd love to see bitcoins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish these these retail shops and
dispensaries would use Bitcoin credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what the barrier is for
not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you just run a credit card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would buy bitcoins, transfer it over to
the dispensary or retail shop and your
[SPEAKER_00]: credit card receipt would just say Bitcoin
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that there's folks in the
audience who are, you know, very focused
[SPEAKER_01]: and excited about taking some action on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we've given them a lot of
first steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for certain anybody who is either A,
going to take their business seriously,
[SPEAKER_01]: B, want to get a federal trademark so that
they can expand their brand across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country and C, certainly if they're going
to have any plan on going international,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these people are going to want to
get an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two things I'm curious about for
you, Neil, is number one, what are typical
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney's fees for this, like just
beginning stuff just to kind of get you
[SPEAKER_01]: established?
[SPEAKER_01]: With a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more importantly, what attributes
should somebody be looking for when
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to a trademark attorney?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just like I tell people,
you know, interview a couple real estate
[SPEAKER_01]: agents and know what you want them to know
so that you know if they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be the same thing with
trademark attorneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what should somebody be
prepared to pony up financially and what
[SPEAKER_01]: should they ask their potential attorney?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the first thing, I would
recommend not going to one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big one in California and then
there's some of these websites that offer
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different services and they offer
really low prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I could see the compulsion to go
with them, but there's a lot of add on
[SPEAKER_00]: fees and they're not doing the proper
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get eight to 12 months down the
registration process, which is about what
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 12 months on a good day if you have
no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you don't have a trademark and
you're out that, hey, it was only a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred bucks, but now you've got to start
back at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even worse, it could do damage to your
ability to get it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they bring them to me after they
get a rejection, I can't save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole narrative is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically have to abandon it,
wait a little while and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when going to a trademark attorney,
there's maybe four law firms that handle
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarks and cannabis right now and
they're all competent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's going to be fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you like them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be pricing and the pricing
could be anywhere from $1,200 to $5,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those pricing is because it's
not apples to apples comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll say, look, we'll do the search
and file it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, office action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thousand or 2000,
you know, where we do a flat rate that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes most office actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the only price you're going to get
the whole time, but everybody's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit different, but it's really
just their comfort level with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the USPTO because that should be a
specialized field or is a specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: field in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular trademark attorney will screw
this up left and right until they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some experience in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way to go as far as choosing
an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess for my last question,
you know, we're all pretty much expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: that at some point, you know, something
political, whether or not cannabis becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: scheduled to, or maybe better yet,
it becomes unscheduled or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: any one of these odd things that are
happening in our political environment
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, one way or another,
cannabis is going to get the blessing
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're okay nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you foresee as being the,
I guess, the sign, the signal that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: should start filing or you said,
you said earlier, actually the race to the
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular thing that will
happen after the law changes, which is our
[SPEAKER_01]: universal signal to go and do this now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say do it at day one and just get
started as far as how each office handles
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trademark office handles things
different than the FDA, which handles
[SPEAKER_00]: things different than department of
justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really just look to different
weighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it does get de-scheduled,
the trademark office will adapt pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly or may create its own rules to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may create a new class for cannabis,
which is really what I think should
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, but can't without the UN's
approval, the white boat's approval,
[SPEAKER_00]: the world intellectual property
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how it's actually going to
come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just guesswork right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like another good reason to have an
attorney so that they can tell you too,
[SPEAKER_01]: since they're watching it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Neil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are some of the best
explanations I've ever heard for
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's such a confusing area.
