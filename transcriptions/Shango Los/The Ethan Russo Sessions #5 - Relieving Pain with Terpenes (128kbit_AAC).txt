[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, I'm asked by pain patients a
lot, especially new cannabis pain
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, what terpenes that they should
be seeking out to reduce their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they usually are asking me both for
what they should be looking for in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, but then also most of them say,
can I put it in my aromatherapy diffuser
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What terpenes are going to be best for
chronic pain patients just to feel a
[SPEAKER_01]: little better in their human?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there ways that they can get that
terpene in addition to then just the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant to help them relieve their
suffering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is one of those instances where
mercy can have a benefit on pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but particularly at bedtime because of its
narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessarily going to be the
best choice during the day for the chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha pining has anti-inflammatory
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linolol is going to help with anxiety
that's engendered by chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caryophylline is going to be a great
choice in terms of being an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory analgesic in its own
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully synergizing with other
components of cannabis, particularly if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's available along with THC and CBD,
this is going to be a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked before about how mercy is
kind of the couch-lock terpene,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the variety of terpenes that you
just mentioned, if you took that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be sleepy, you'd be lethargic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of an end-of-day cocktail.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend for pain folks
who need to remain productive during the
[SPEAKER_01]: day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say those same ones,
but drop the miracene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you keep the miracene and put
something else stimulating like a citrine
[SPEAKER_01]: or something on top of it to help modulate
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the day, an ideal mixture would
be a small amount of THC, a larger amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD, and a little bit of alpha pining
to a allow a clear head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a bit of limonene for mood
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good bit of caryophylline to boost the
pain relieving properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a great approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to learn more about
this, you can find the link to Dr. Russo's
[SPEAKER_01]: Taming THC paper in the first comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
