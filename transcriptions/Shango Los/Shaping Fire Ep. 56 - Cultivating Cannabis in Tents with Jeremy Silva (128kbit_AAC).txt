[SPEAKER_00]: While it is certainly true that growing
cannabis can still lead to a prison
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence in some states, home growing for
personal consumption is exploding across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states have enacted some sort of
home-grow allotment with their licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis companies, and in states with
licensed cannabis but no home growing like
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state, the enforcement is close
to zero for individuals just growing a few
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rapid rise in personal growth has been
an epic boon for horticulture companies of
[SPEAKER_00]: all flavors, and lights and nutrients and
seeds are all being sold at a rapid pace
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks are more openly sharing what they
have grown too, on social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: with neighbors, and at barbecues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal grows are an essential part of
cannabis normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where are all these home growers
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, if you listen to Shaping Fire,
you know that we support outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime grows because they use the
sunshine instead of electric lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everyone has access to the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients don't have the mobility to
get outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many apartment dwellers have no yard at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even many folks who do have yards
still don't feel comfortable growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the yard because of neighbors
or local kids or simple space concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing all of these cannabis consumers
can turn to is the indoor growing tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tents create an artificial indoor
environment that can be climate
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled, especially to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have reflective interiors to move the
light around, and fine mesh zippers and
[SPEAKER_00]: flaps that keep the light inside the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are clandestine, compact,
and pretty affordable to get started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow tents have been an essential aspect
of cannabis culture for decades because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can make the indoor gardener
self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And self-sufficiency is a universally
accepted human value.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Jeremy Silva,
founder of Build-A-Soil, a horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: supply retailer in Montrose, Colorado and
online at buildasoil.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy studies best practices for
home-growing tents more than anyone I
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and you can watch his experiments
live online as they happen on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Build-A-Soil Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy's background helping medical
cannabis patients with their grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting friends hooked on worm castings
from his compost bin has served him well
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cannabis horticulture educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy also practices jiu-jitsu,
which helps him understand energy
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships, and I've found that it
often finds its way into his explanations
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about growing
cannabis for personal consumption at home
[SPEAKER_00]: using a cultivation tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for making the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go right into talking about the
size of tent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people struggle a
little bit like, oh my gosh, how tall do I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have my tent or how big does it
have to be to be worthwhile at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally when I'm talking to people
about setting up a tent, I just say get a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent that's as big as the space that you
have because no matter how big your tent
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you're going to wish you had a bigger
tent in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I know that you've got
people coming to you all the time who are
[SPEAKER_00]: about to initiate their first tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of advice do you give them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, these are really good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am similar to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, hey, get the biggest one that you
can afford based on your size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically most customers are saying,
hey, it's going to be in a bedroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: a garage, a closet, somewhere where
usually it's something beyond the tent
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to frame in their size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times that might be at
minimum just ceiling height, even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have an open bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're looking at a grow tent,
we offer the gorilla tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million tents out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that most all of them will
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the gorilla has some extensions on
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be important for you to
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that some of our customers
forget, and I know I didn't really think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it the first time I bought a tent,
is that it takes extra space in your room
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually construct and build the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally it takes an extra person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty good at doing it by myself if
it's small with a step stool and being
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes with a low ceiling or a very
tight ceiling, you have to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: consider how you're going to construct it
and have enough space to wrap the outer
[SPEAKER_01]: material around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, if space is not really the
limitation, and you're wondering,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I've got an open room.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I consider what's too tall,
too short, and what's optimum for
[SPEAKER_01]: environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would be questioning what type of
light you're going to use and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: budget looks like for controlling the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be my secondary dictator of
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primary would be the size that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have unlimited size, then secondary,
I'm going to compare my budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I already have a grow light and
it's veryâ€”maybe it's old school,
[SPEAKER_01]: puts out a lot of heat, I'm going to need
to go on the taller side of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have an option to get a newer age,
cooler running grow light, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: not consider the height as a main limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I want to consider
throughout this whole series is using
[SPEAKER_01]: holistic decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means looking at the weakest link
that should guide you in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: making those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, they think that they
may need to add a little bit of extra size
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can get in and move around in
their tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tell people is if you're
planning on getting into the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably not thinking through
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in a perfect world, we should not
be getting into our tents because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be bringing in lots of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contaminants and the risk of snapping
off parts of the plants increases greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: when your butt's in there moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tell people, pretty much plan on
filling up the tent, but not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into it physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get on your hands and knees to
reach something that's going on towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the back, but don't be planning from the
get go to be taking your feet and your
[SPEAKER_00]: body into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that 99% of the time,
that's pretty much the way to the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're looking at a tent,
some of them have a D-shaped door on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them fully unwrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to take into
consideration if you're putting it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: corner which side that third access door
is, how you might orient the tent so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can access a side panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key weaknesses of a grow tent
is its main zipper that has multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: directions of pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have to completely unhook the
zipper every single time you open it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to cause advanced wear and tear
no matter the manufacturer and will last a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you have a D door,
a side panel, something that you can enter
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more frequently, that will
greatly increase the lifespan of your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's ways to repair them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the end of the world,
but that's something to consider as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: the shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will say a lot of our customers,
if they have an open warehouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will get like a 10 by 10 or a 10 by
20.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll set up an entire grow room inside
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will walk inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's because the long room
around it is maybe a lower temperature or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they kind of want to get
inside and maybe reseal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is a much bigger situation and
you should know exactly what you need at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're asking what grow tent,
normally those are going to be the main
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements is consider a size that you
can max out space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're kind of wasting paying
for the electricity for having walking
[SPEAKER_01]: area, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gosh, having a 10 by 20 would be super
boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most people I know and probably
most people who are listening,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking more about working in a
four by four or similar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people come to a tent because
they want to be able to grow their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and they live either in an
apartment situation or a housing situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where growing outdoors is not reasonable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally people come to a tent because
of, you know, area constraints at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly know plenty of folks who
are breeding who decide that, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it makes a lot more sense for me
to set up, you know, 12, 10 by 20 tents
[SPEAKER_00]: and have all of these individual
environments within my bigger warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not as much what we're talking
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly that's a great application,
but we're really talking more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: home grower who's just trying to grow
their own ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and a tent makes sense, especially
because you can build something pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap, but then it takes time,
effort, labor, tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now construction, not as easily
collapsible and movable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these tents, they have vents,
they hang your lights, they work really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really well and they can be affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that on the minimum side,
if we're just looking at like a three by
[SPEAKER_01]: three versus a four by four, most of the
grow lights are gonna be pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase and upgrade on kind of a four by
four platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start with a four by four,
you get a secondary tent, it'll always
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, if you go with a three
by three, if you had room for that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: foot around, I mean, it's gonna make a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: From nine square feet to 16 is a lot
bigger jump than people think of when they
[SPEAKER_01]: say three by three or four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus a lot of the things in the market are
designed size-wise for the four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just be easier to buy your gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and always having a little perimeter
space in case your ventilation moves the
[SPEAKER_01]: sides of the tent in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, like for instance out here,
it's fairly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use a passive air intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm exhausting air,
it tends to pull the tents just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in a three by three,
it's gonna then shrink your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you out here in the winter,
it can create condensation and all sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a four by four kind of at
minimum, I really like if we can get to
[SPEAKER_01]: that size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it makes everything a little
bit more scalable and a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: usable, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, historically, everybody was
growing in plastic pots, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the last several years,
we've got really nice fabric pots out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've personally, while I was growing,
I don't have one in my four by four yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fallen in love with the four by
four fabric raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I next upgrade my tent, that's where
I'm going, because I love the idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots being able to interact with each
other, so that the plants don't feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's as much of a monoculture,
that they get to talk to each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the containers that we use are really,
should be customized for our growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each have their advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have done more tests in tents than
anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that you have gone through
plastic versus fabric pots versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you compare and contrast them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these methods will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all what's right for you and your
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you hit on, there's going to be
pros and cons for every single one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people jumped on the fabric pot
bandwagon without doing investigation on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the differences might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'd carry their same watering
practices from plastic to fabric,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would maybe unfairly judge the
fabric based on old habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that as long as you have an
idea of your watering habits and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: pros and cons are, you can fairly choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously with the plastic,
it's not going to breathe the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that it's going to hold
water a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times if you're trying to sex
seedlings and you're forcing them in
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller containers because you're limited
space until they've identified their sex,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times you want the plants to hold
on to a little bit of water at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it dries out too quickly,
it may lead to more labor on your part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a busy life,
it may lead to a decline in health in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, plastic's reusable,
it holds more water, and they are nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main argument is that plastic will
swirl the roots, where the fabric,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it breathes on the edge, it will root
prune.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a hybrid option now that
Grassroots Fabric Pots offers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell and we're slowly working our way
down all the way to one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a fabric pot that's foldable,
which is great for shipping cost and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental cost, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also is reusable, but it's lined about
75 to 80% with plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom inches remain open to root
prune.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots are guided from the side
where they hit the plastic down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of circling, theyâ€”they air
prune when they get to theâ€”the part that
[SPEAKER_01]: breathes down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this prevents the kind of root rot at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the big plastic containers
will have large air holes at the bottom to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow the pots to breathe, but that
willâ€”that will let your soil fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets all over the place,
where in the fabric container that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So main consideration with like a living
soil grow, whether you're doing plastic,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're doing fabric, is gonna be
the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I found,
most of our customer base who is looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in a regenerative organic style
and look for the processes that mimic
[SPEAKER_01]: natureâ€”and they'reâ€”they're into that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, what we're gonna do is look for
a bigger container size because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna allow the biology to keep up
with the nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna allow co-mingling of roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly for me, it's gonna
allow me to go snowboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna allow me to go spend time with
my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that I'm not potentially
stressed out about the garden back at home
[SPEAKER_01]: not being tended to properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I know about gardening is
it's about discipline and routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can set that cycle up to be
hedged on our side a little bit so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more simple, I think that we're
gonna experience a year-round production
[SPEAKER_01]: that is very quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is gonna be the first step in
preventing pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're consistent, we should not
see a decline in health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like a larger container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like the fabric that is lined
with the plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indoors, the way I'd make the
determining factor is if you live in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very humid environment, straight fabric's
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Colorado, it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the plastic-lined fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then either way, you just have to
adapt your watering practices to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not over or under watering because
of the slight differences between the
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that large container, it's a lot
like people preferring larger aquariums,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot more water in the aquarium,
the water can buffer any mistakes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make and it doesn't affect the fish as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly with our plants, the more soil
we have, everything gets buffered a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more and they can share resources in
water and it makes your mistakes are
[SPEAKER_00]: softened a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I often hear from patients that
I work with is that they've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: hesitation to go with one big container in
the tent because they wanna keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: option to be able to take the plants out
of the tent and go into the light of day
[SPEAKER_00]: or into another room so that they can work
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever their concern is, they'd much
rather go with one container per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just in case they need to pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often suggest, if that's gonna help
you while you are learning how to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the worst thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really much better for the plant
if you let them co-mingle like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you help people weigh that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost forgot what it's like to have
that thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of why it's helpful to
have these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can remember when I was considering
going to a larger bed, I was very much
[SPEAKER_01]: paralyzed by the thought that I can't see
that back right corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't clear them out and bring that one
up front to investigate because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the spider mites were.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the problem started,
where I couldn't get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I learned over a long period of
time developing confidence was that a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger bed, it stopped the number one
effect, which is the over and under
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you got into a cycle,
it prevented more disease, more pest
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, and it actually improved the
quality so that I never, ever needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: move that plant and rotate it or move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I don't even consider it,
in fact, just as much as my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never am gonna go pull any of the
vegetables out of the farm, bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: into the kitchen, investigate them and go
put them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think if we just kind of
eliminate that as we're more farming than
[SPEAKER_01]: we are trying to grow like hydroponically,
and as long as they know that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable and people are successful doing
that, I think that they'll be okay with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, I have a lot of
people that like to have lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors and a constant perpetual grow and
are a little less comfortable using a
[SPEAKER_01]: large container, or they just don't have
the ability to carry that much upstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: and into an apartment, whatever the
limitation might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you can be just as
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main caveat here is that if we can
limit the plant size to be equal or
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller than the volume of soil,
we will be much more geared towards
[SPEAKER_01]: success because we will not push the
limitations of the nutrient cycling in the
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a 5-gallon plant,
you might want to flip the flower when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just past clone size, and then you'll
be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to still be a little
more cautious on over and under watering
[SPEAKER_01]: and tend to it a little more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably can't leave for a full
weekend during peak stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a larger container, the only caveat
is that this works phenomenally well so
[SPEAKER_01]: long as we don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you're not overamending and
overwatering, the large container is by
[SPEAKER_01]: far the best way to go because you can
always add more later, you can always
[SPEAKER_01]: water more the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only challenge is if you really,
really overdo it on a large container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's because of that that I don't
discourage people using smaller containers
[SPEAKER_01]: to ramp up their learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a 15-gallon to a 30-gallon is an
incredible size container so long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is flipped into flower early enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from those experiences,
I think they're gonna be a really natural
[SPEAKER_01]: next step to dump that same soil they've
already used into their now larger
[SPEAKER_01]: container and really get the whole process
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you get worms and you get
this whole ecosystem that can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive even between cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just get great results in the larger
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one more group of people that I
wanna make sure that we address because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that this is a lot of folks and I
have been this person and that if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower who's going to be using a tent
and you might have to move it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are renting and you'd prefer your
landlord wasn't aware of it, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: house and your parents might be coming to
visit, if you are concerned about an
[SPEAKER_00]: incident or an insurance adjuster who
might come by at some point during the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, we all have these issues that come
up where your grow space may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: totally your own and you might need to
move your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that people
should let themselves off the hook for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if you have got a secure place
to grow, going into a bigger pot is always
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're renting, sometimes you have
to let other people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need to have the ability to,
oh, I'm having somebody come over in two
[SPEAKER_00]: days and you need to be able to take your
plants and stash them at a neighbor's
[SPEAKER_00]: place for 48 hours or 36 hours,
don't hold that against yourself to have
[SPEAKER_00]: individual containers for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scale and we're all trying to do
the best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to keep your individual
pots just so you can have a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still way ahead of the curve by
having individual pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and you can totally do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a 15-gallon, it sounds small to me
now, but I remember when that was just
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive, really large, a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I think that's so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a 15-gallon can be on top of a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have to leave for maybe a day
longer than normal, you can maybe bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some tricks that you can kind of
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter what, you'll be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only being aware of the limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, telling your buddy
to come over or someone in your household
[SPEAKER_01]: and having a water can set next to the
plant and tell him to put that precise
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of water on the four plants or
whatever is still way easier than telling
[SPEAKER_01]: him to pH this and add this many
milliliters and make sure they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: overdo it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter what you do, there's going to
be a solution for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just being aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to hit in this
section, and I'm assuming that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in the same category,
I really recommend everybody to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: floor liner, a tray for the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started out, I'm like,
oh, this is a place that I'm going to save
[SPEAKER_00]: some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom of my tent is silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it might be waterproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And golly, that was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the pots give off water and debris
and just random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also can create an opportunity for
condensation between the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then when you remove the tent,
you end up, you've got, oh, my god,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this water spot on my floor of my
apartment or house now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not recommend trays being a
place that people try to save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and make sure you get something
with a lip that you can put under the pots
[SPEAKER_00]: between the pots and the bottom of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be really glad you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biological soils, they'll eat away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plastic liners that come in the
tents, they're like to be the insert that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a lip that is foldable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put in the bottom of the tent over
the poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly to keep any moisture off of
the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's going to rust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would leak into the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a secondary prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on a concrete floor here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my tent was old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the 100-gallon container I have
right on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a horrible idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you care about your tent and,
like you said, the home, it's a lot better
[SPEAKER_01]: idea to try and put something,
a tray, a flood tray, anything like that
[SPEAKER_01]: below it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the trick is, if you ever have an
issue where there was some buildup in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or you overworked, you can just take
a shop vac and vacuum it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything stays clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said in the intro to the show,
there is no way that we are going to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: all of soil science and chemistry in one
part of a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, all we're trying to do is give
folks who have come to the show because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're new some ability to get started
because they're going to know a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of their first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first cycle than they do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for folks who have been growing a long
time and they know that you can just lose
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and hours and hours researching
soil, we're just going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulate it based on general best
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wade into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and I are both living soil guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that we have a
thriving microbiome in the container so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the area around the plant roots,
the rhizosphere, is providing all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes needed to the plant so that that
exchange between the microbes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can happen in a healthy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, there's lots of ways to create
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Jeremy, I know that through running
the shop, you spend a lot of time with new
[SPEAKER_00]: folks trying to get them over the hump or
over the rabbit hole of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you find is like the basic best
practices to get folks going so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into their first grow and not
spend six months learning about soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science before they get to turn their
lights on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that's a good question because you
don't really have to understand it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down to its nuances to be able to
operate successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that listeners will be happy
to know that we've had successful grows in
[SPEAKER_01]: every variety of soil that the soil tests
themselves basically on paper said would
[SPEAKER_01]: not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these plants do have a lot of
forgiveness and in an effort of really
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better each year, you can really
go down the rabbit hole of soil science,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil testing, and balancing cations and
you can definitely improve disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that doesn't need to be all
considered on your first grow because if
[SPEAKER_01]: this is done right with the basic formula,
you can have success and it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly better than what you can
find locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still gonna be great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the old rule of thumb that we've
used from the forums was to try and find a
[SPEAKER_01]: local compost source that was quality if
we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be kind of a challenging
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times you can reach out and find
what people around the area are saying is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best and word of mouth, message
boards, Craigslist, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, we would make a known kind
of potting soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main reason is that growing
indoors is very different than considering
[SPEAKER_01]: your regional soil and trying to amend
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these containers, we kind of have
proven formulas where there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of aeration, a certain amount of
the bulk medium like coconut core or peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss, something to be the fluff that holds
all of this together, and then another
[SPEAKER_01]: portion is the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recipe we first started with
was a three-part recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part compost, one part pumice or
perlite, or rice holes, anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: would add that drainage factor,
and one part of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used peat moss and we still do,
and that's mainly because you can add
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium to it to really get that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the shorthand is that if you mix peat
moss or cocoa core with a good compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: a drainage component, one-third each,
you should have a great beginnings of a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we noticed in
the living soil community was that like in
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic, you could say, what's your pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could have the same conversation
coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in organics, it was always a little
bit of nuance, and that's where Build A
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is brought in, soil testing and
premium compost that have kind of a known
[SPEAKER_01]: starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're gonna start in your area,
the old school trick, instead of using
[SPEAKER_01]: one-third compost, and let's say you have
access to a few different composts,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would try each one of them at 10%,
20%, and 30% of my recipe and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that point forward, without spending
a lot of money and time, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: basically which direction ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only reason I say that is sometimes a
local municipal compost, it just might be
[SPEAKER_01]: too potent at 30%, where the worm castings
down the street might be great at 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the nuance for making your
own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, Build A Soil offers premixed
soils, and we also are aware of other
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers that make good soils we like
to recommend, depending on where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's address this idea of no-till
right here, because for years and years
[SPEAKER_00]: and years, after every run, we got rid of
all of our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that was fine for the times,
I would say that two things that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned encourage us to keep the soil from
one run to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, redoing your soil after every
run can be expensive, especially if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do this on a reasonable budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then number two, when you're starting
with brand new soil, the amount of time it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes for the fungal networks to grow and
the microbe numbers to increase in number
[SPEAKER_00]: is about the same lifetime of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your soil is really just getting to
be its best at right about the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really like to just leave that
soil in the container, top dress it to
[SPEAKER_00]: refresh some of the nutrients,
and then just plant my new clone just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see where the root ball already is from
the prior plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you save some money and your
second plant, you're planting into a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: that is already fungal rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all almost conditioned to be
balanced towards that type of plant as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the limiting factor, like you said,
is now we're erring on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: monocropping the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same type of plant over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing we know from farming is you
probably got to like rotate crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things we do to overcome
that is by making sure that there's good
[SPEAKER_01]: biology there and using best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we're bringing it indoors and
because we're harvesting and taking from
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, all you have to do is remember
to top dress and add some basic organic
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you're slowly feeding that
system, it'll constantly feed back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in a regenerative agriculture
setting, to build soil without soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing that is gonna be productive,
we know that you can basically use cover
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping in animal husbandry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would literally make soil out of
nothing, attract worms and predators and
[SPEAKER_01]: birds and everything you can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't quite do that indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things we can do to improve
a soil that may not be adequately balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: is to grow a little bit of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you canâ€”you can get out of hand,
but if you do it short and then just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of work it in with your hands,
pretending like you're a migratory animal
[SPEAKER_01]: or stomping it down or chopping it up,
work it into the top layer, not really
[SPEAKER_01]: tilling, but just adding to that mulch
layer, that will create an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ecosystem, if you put a few worms in
there, will now constantly break that
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch layer down for you, allowing you to
keep your soil again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever you top dress, that's
basically feeding the worms that'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: this into an active fertilizer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so, it usually keeps it
relatively balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've learned a few things like
calcium needs to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for disease resistance
andâ€”and plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you know a couple basics,
a top dress is almost all you need once
[SPEAKER_01]: you have this little ecosystem working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just gets better and better with
time, where one of the things I've
[SPEAKER_01]: observed is if things are too potent and
we never grow a cover crop or we never
[SPEAKER_01]: have the worms, it can kind of start to
skew one direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it may not be immediately
advantageous or it may not appear
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately advantageous to add some worms
or to go through the cover cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: process, but when they're used properly,
they can keep this ever cycling without
[SPEAKER_01]: getting out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we leave soil, let's talk a little
bit about nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is another topic that some
people dedicate their whole lives to,
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out what the best nutrition is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're starting out, you really
can do a lot with just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tell the patients that I help
them get their grows set up is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: they take a good quality soil like you
have described on theâ€”on the one-third,
[SPEAKER_00]: one-third, one-third system, and that if
you amend it with worm castings and you
[SPEAKER_00]: water with compost, compost tea,
that you will not fail based on nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be things that you can do better
as you get more experienced, but good worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings and compost tea will give you
enough to give yourself some good
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on what is kind of
your entry-level nutrition solution as you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to get more experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hit the nail on the head,
there's a wide enough margin of error
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you're using good inputs,
you're gonna have good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now from there, I will say the number one
limiting factors that we've seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they may not be immediately
transparent, but you'll notice disease
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance and everything is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is considering what a lot of
people call like a high-bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology, and that is typically when we
look at what creates that nutrient-dense,
[SPEAKER_01]: really sugar-creating plant is calcium,
phosphorus, and balance between the other
[SPEAKER_01]: cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have this balance,
the plant's biology and the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: resources, they're never robbing Peter to
pay Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature has the ability to get the job done
more ways than we can imagine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but its path of least resistance is how
nature's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something's missing, it's just
gonna move on and use something else to do
[SPEAKER_01]: its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to keep the ink cartridge in
our printer, so to speak, full.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, we're never using the wrong
color or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what you're gonna see
where if you can focus on the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factor, I think, in a compost,
is that it's gonna be low on calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second to that, usually it's gonna be
imbalanced in the phosphorus to potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right away without knowing much,
if we just know we're using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, I know that usually calcium and
phosphorus are low and potassium's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were to add some calcium,
and some phosphorus, either calphos is a
[SPEAKER_01]: great product or gypsum and fish bone
meal, there's a number of ways to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You typically are gonna gear yourself
forâ€”up for a healthier plant that's able
[SPEAKER_01]: to build its cell walls faster,
have a larger yield, and the phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be the main energy source there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, we were successful for a
long time using, you know, all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost andâ€”and not really considering
thoseâ€”those advanced topics, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a personal question of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, inâ€”in adding calcium,
Iâ€”one of the challenges is always having
[SPEAKER_00]: these inputs be available to the plant
because they need to be broken down by the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that manyâ€”many organic
shops, including your own, carry theâ€”the
[SPEAKER_00]: crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought, oh, all right,
well, I live on an island andâ€”and we get
[SPEAKER_00]: crab all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just get the Dungeness crab that
we eat and I put them in a bag and I hit
[SPEAKER_00]: them a bunch with a hammer to make my own
dust and I kinda scratch it into my top
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that Iâ€”I water through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I kidding myself that that calcium is
bioavailable to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, you're getting a lot of
chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that one of the things
you'll notice when you start, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: making a worm bin, one of the first things
you learn is that the worms don't eat
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exude enzymes that are particular to
the compound they're breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is cellulose, second is chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two most abundant there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're gonna have a lot of enzymes
geared towards breaking those down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are ones specific to phosphorus,
calcium, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you add that material,
you're steering the biology to be creating
[SPEAKER_01]: materials that will break that compound
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a worm bin, as long as you don't
introduce a brand new material all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, it's normally microbially geared
towards breaking that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference in theâ€”in the product
that we sell is that it's been ground down
[SPEAKER_01]: to probably slightly finer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that the way you're doing
it, there's gonna be some short-term and
[SPEAKER_01]: some long-term, but in aâ€”in a highly
biologically active soil, especially one
[SPEAKER_01]: with worms, you're not gonna have any
problem making that calcium available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add eggshells, all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what we're looking at is
calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many ways to get that,
but there's also many forms of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you start doing soil testing,
you'll find there's calcium silicate,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's calcium carbonate, there's calcium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's reasons to choose one or
the other, but when you have a local
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and you can use it like that,
I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan anytime that we can do
wildcrafting too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we wantâ€”we want to make sure that
we are kind to the environment and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don'tâ€”we don't want to take so much that
we cause environmental degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gosh, there are so many things all
around us that the earth gives us that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes either just raw as is or with a
little bit of effort, we can replace some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the costs of our grow simply by taking
a nice walk outside high, finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, you know, plant or whatever,
and then bringing it back and chopping it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of course, this isâ€”this is how
people get addicted and find their way to
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming techniques,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butâ€”but the idea of going out and
interacting with nature and having to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn these plants and bringing them back,
I think there's a lot of value in that for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, there really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ways I would recommend to
do that is to look around your local area.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, here in Colorado,
I can purchase a book that's edible plants
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Rockies and there's several other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your region, find a book that
highlights the edible and medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area and you'llâ€”you'll be
onâ€”you'll be blown away at how many there
[SPEAKER_01]: are around you right on your property in
the park nearby that you can go andâ€”and
[SPEAKER_01]: leverage and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for instance, inâ€”right down the
street from me, there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: puzzle grass, they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's high in silica and it's basically
horsetail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll go harvest that and top dress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things you get when you
wildcraft, especially in K&F, you learn
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that if you get the fast growing
tips of a healthy wild plant, it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be coated in the natural biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have all the growth hormones
that the tip of the plant and shoots have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's the healthy plant and
it's the tip of the plant, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have any of the disease or pest
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you bring that home and you
incorporate it in your system,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's when you're really
building the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're actually bringing in
biology and all the things that are proven
[SPEAKER_01]: to be in a healthy phylosphere or a
healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one caveat like you mentioned is we
don't like educating people to go wild
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and find out that they are maybe
abusing it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be mindful and pull from multiple
locations and be considerate and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people live in places where
maybe they don't have easy access to
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would be astonished how many of
the plants that your neighbors consider
[SPEAKER_00]: invasives are actually really good for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, you don't wanna go and
harvest from a yard that they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanna avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I live, people consider nettles
an invasive as well as the horsetail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, come get all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, I'm happy to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get that stuff because I can throw it
in a bucket of clean water with a bubbler
[SPEAKER_00]: and bubble it for 24 hours and water with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my plants are totally stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my neighbors consider it a good thing
that I'm doing this to help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, no, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grab bags of leaves, especially if I
know a property that doesn't spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can take the leaves and chop them
up with grass and almost make an instant
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks down so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tricks that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time that are regional,
local based, depending on your resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that those are some of the
parts where we really get to connect on a
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual level to the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of our customers agree that
there's more to it than just a part A and
[SPEAKER_01]: a part B and an end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a enjoyment of the process and a
realization that this is a lifetime and
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's lots of lessons to be learned
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And embracing that creates a really
rewarding garden system, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we come back from break,
we're going to start off with the monster
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, let's go ahead and take
that first short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Jeremy Silva, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspecta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity and
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement these biological solutions,
real science education is vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing, you will probably want
[SPEAKER_00]: to attend this year's Science of Organic
Regenerative Cannabis Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the third year in a row, co-founders
Joshua Rutherford of Dutch Blooms and
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton Morrison of Kingdom Aquaponics
have lined up an incredible array of
[SPEAKER_00]: educators with all new content for the
traveling event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling it version 2.0,
going deeper down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year's teaching staff includes Elaine
Ingham on soil biology, Chris Trump and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy Kornberg talking Korean natural
farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelly and Josh from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, Suzanne Wainwright the bug lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chip Osborne on soil chemistry,
and many other thought leaders rotating in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out for different cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consult the website to know who's
specifically is coming for each location.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a breeding panel,
a Q&A panel with the entire teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: staff, and on Saturday night, there will
be a bubble hash discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua has built in significant informal
time for you with the teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also no advertising during the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only vendor booths are for cannabis
seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tuition is what's paying the staff,
so they all be present and attentive to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, not a corporate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better, the conference is not just
for folks on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt California is hosting one event
for sure, but the show is going on the
[SPEAKER_00]: road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine, and Whitmore Lake,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out your pen now, because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized top shelf soil educators all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intensive, intensive for people
like us who totally nerd out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and growing and living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you attended last year,
be assured that this year is not simply a
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every speaker will present different
material than they did last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, tickets will be limited in
number to preserve the intimate experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and will only be sold in advance online.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no ticket sales at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wait and miss out on your chance
to attend this important gathering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lose, and our guest
this week is Jeremy Silva, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in the second set,
and we are going to start off with the
[SPEAKER_00]: monster in the room, which is lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights is actually the part of the growing
process that I am the weakest,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have got a four by four indoors
that I use to dabble with and to learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to scrog and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I'm all about the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow every summer and I prepare all
winter for that summer grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I don't really have
the same kind of depth in lights as a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of folks do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did go and get my lights,
I essentially just asked my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was really into LED, which one I
should buy for the money I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: and boom, I went and I bought it,
and that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we really want to get people
prepared to either get a cast off light
[SPEAKER_00]: from a friend or potentially get a light
secondhand at a reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got the budget, maybe get one
of these sexy new LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Jeremy, I'm just going to
hand you the mic and say, walk us through
[SPEAKER_00]: the considerations for lights that you see
most common with the customers who come
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of things that I learned
the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung a light that was too powerful for
my grow space, thinking, oh, I'll buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't ready on the ventilation
side, and my plants didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty bad experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that lesson, I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more about getting the right
light for your situation or leveraging the
[SPEAKER_01]: light you have to work in your situation
than it is about getting any specific
[SPEAKER_01]: brand or specific product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's lights that are better
than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as getting a grow light is
concerned, you're going to get an end
[SPEAKER_01]: result that's based on, most directly,
the wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondarily to that, how you're
going to manage the heat that it puts off,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is directly related to the
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a very low grow tent or
ceiling, you're going to be forced to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at newer technologies that don't push so
much heat straight down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're going to look at lower energy
technologies like CFL, T5, things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more challenging and less rewarding from
yield but can still be done at a very
[SPEAKER_01]: quality level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you get a used light,
and let's say it's an HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's high-intensity discharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the lights we read about and used
for decades were either a metal halide,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue or large bulb, or a high-pressure
sodium, the more red-orange-looking light
[SPEAKER_01]: that was for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue was for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still get those really
cost-effective, and I will give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple things to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is you're going to have to
replace theâ€”the bulbs, and that's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, it may not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a safety factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a family, if you're worried
about fires, if you've got some potential
[SPEAKER_01]: there where maybe it'sâ€”it's dirty or
something, at least consider that so you
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it, you're aware of the limitations,
and thatâ€”and that that is thought of
[SPEAKER_01]: because the new technology, albeit
expensive, is very safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, after that, you can consider the
PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a way to do that, PAR is
photosynthetically active radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically, it's the output of the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to advertise on the old
lights lumens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the humans see.
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR is more what the spectrum,
the plants see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look for a light,
all we're trying to do is gauge the
[SPEAKER_01]: distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a 6-foot-tall grow tent,
you look up the light that you got from a
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy or on Craigslist or what you have
access to purchase, and it says,
[SPEAKER_01]: at 2 feet, the PAR is X, or at 1 foot,
the PAR is X, consider that and follow
[SPEAKER_01]: those manufacturer recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get that information normally
in veg, you're safe anywhere from 100 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 500 PAR, and in flour, the range is 500 to
1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get closer to 1,000, it's a little
bit intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a little bit bright on the top
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got an old light that's
putting a lot of heat out, you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: to have it further in your grow tent up,
and that might limit the height of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any light will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to start to be aware of
those limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does because, really,
we all grow weed with all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just have to be prepared,
like, okay, if you're going to choose a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that fits your budget but
produces a lot of heat, well, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to make up for the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got more money but you don't
want to have as much heat, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, well, then you're going to react to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your general thought, though,
to get started with whatever you can and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't put off the growing just because you
don't have the sexy new light budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and especially if you're like me and
you were buying cannabis beforehand,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to save room in your budget so
quickly once you get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll change from being just a consumer
to being a producer, and that'll give you
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you never make money from your
grow and you never sell a vegetable,
[SPEAKER_01]: never trade cannabis, just having offset
your own personal budget and being
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient enough to not overpay an
electricity versus your production,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the new spectrums, the new
technology, they definitely produce better
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a situation where you can
just go buy a grow light, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely recommend looking at LED,
ceramic metal halide, because those two
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies are pretty proven,
and there's a lot of manufacturers that
[SPEAKER_01]: make them, and there's a lot of basic
information about, like, how far to put
[SPEAKER_01]: them, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you say a couple words about the age
of bulbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, there are a lot of
people who get lights from their friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, bulbs have only got a
certain amount of life in them before they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to shift spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I've never owned these,
I've never had that experience myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you'll noticeâ€”so there's a
couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be that we all used glass
hoods, and you'll find that if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: the used market, you'll find an air-cooled
glass-encased hood where the bulb is up in
[SPEAKER_01]: this big hood, and below it is this glass
panel that closes, and then you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: vents on both sides and move the air
quickly through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that now you can use a very
powerful grow light, getting the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR level that we want on the surface of
the plant without getting the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: directly on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll suck it out of there with a vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is that blocks the light,
it gets dirty inside of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it lowers the actual light value if you're
not considering cleaning it, and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: there, the lamp inside there can get
dirty, and then beyond that, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning that lamp between cycles,
it also decays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it starts to decay, the ballast
that is sending the power continues to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed 100% of the power to a bulb that can
no longer receive it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once it gets out of whack, it starts to
decline faster and faster, because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer handle the excessive power
that's receiving based on its decay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's not just a
dimmerâ€”it's not just dimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were to read the PAR,
it may not be a huge difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it starts to slide in spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to use that ink
analogy, if you've got a light that is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to produce a certain picture of
color, as it decays, it's not able to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill that color, and it starts to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll notice, depending on the
manufacturer, after a couple of cycles,
[SPEAKER_01]: you start to either lose a quality or a
yield, and so some growers either get a
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap bulb and change it, every single
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some alternative growers will say,
hey, I'd rather get the best quality lamp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll replace it according to their
directions, which is usually on a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: number of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's only in your flower room,
that's 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can calculate that number of hours,
and it's kind of like a water filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you can push it longer, but are you
still receiving all of the benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this conversation moves smoothly into
the discussion of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an entire range of ventilation
woes from the worst, where you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: really hot light that if you don't
ventilate coming out of your tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just cook your plants, all the way
to very modern LED, which are pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might give off some heat,
but nothing that's going to threaten your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and may actually help your tent
stay at a pleasant temperature just
[SPEAKER_00]: because that heat it's giving off is
actually going to be an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people miss the idea
that it's not just simply taking an
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust tube and putting it from the
inside of the tent to the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of energy that goes into your
fan is something that really should be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I think that the home grower
would be, they could benefit from two
[SPEAKER_01]: tools here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you need an exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have an intake fan, and a lot of
people will match the power of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the next tool that I recommend would be
a variable speed controller, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a dimmer switch for your fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We carry a product that has one built in,
or you can buy the basic one and add it
[SPEAKER_01]: separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that you can use is a
feature where you can either control it on
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, or you can just use a basic
timer and turn your fan on and off based
[SPEAKER_01]: on a timer sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why these tools are
important is most growers find that when
[SPEAKER_01]: they just hook up a fan, it may not be
exactly what they need to keep their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a couple options,
a couple scenarios I'll share.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a light that's older and puts
out more heat, heat is based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a thousand watt light,
it's going to put out very similar amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of heat to a brand new thousand watt LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is most people LED wise are
so much more efficient, they can use half
[SPEAKER_01]: the wattage and produce very similar
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be less heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other difference is that the newer
products like that, they push less heat
[SPEAKER_01]: down and more heat comes off the top so
it's easy to evacuate from the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent by exhausting the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, if you need that
warmth, here it's cold in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: that enables you to either slow the
venting down or put it on a timer so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can keep the heat in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the consideration to balance there
is one of looking back at the weakest
[SPEAKER_01]: link.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weakest link in a grow room is going
to be the extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if temperature is too high,
you have to vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say the temperature is in range,
now the reason to vent is based on CO2 and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two things to remember is that
plants require CO2 to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put them in a sealed room with
no fresh air, they will eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocate from burning all the CO2 just
like a human would with a bag over their
[SPEAKER_01]: head with no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a grow room, we need to ventilate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bit of fresh air you bring in adds
fresh CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of organic growers won't
supplement CO2 because they'd rather just
[SPEAKER_01]: have passive or active airflow and that's
where they get CO2 just like nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you have some air moving,
you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean it needs to be cycling
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it is too cold and it's really low
humidity, I would actually run my fan
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe every 15 minutes every hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might keep me warm enough and it
might keep my humidity up because the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a really nice greenhouse effect
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in Colorado, if I just plug my
fan in full blast, 24-7, it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: less than 10% humidity and it might be too
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So venting and lighting is based on trying
to find the optimal environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: without knowing your actual numbers,
I would say that if you can have in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 degrees, 75, 80 degrees, somewhere in
that range, and a high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to 70%, you're gonna have very fast
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contrary to that in flour, you probably
wanna say in a similar temperature range
[SPEAKER_01]: and colder at the end is not as bad,
but you don't wanna be above 50% humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna be in that 40 to 50 range so you
can have good plant health but avoid the
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you consider all that and you're able
to get the environment right and your vent
[SPEAKER_01]: is on every once in a while, you've made
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard many people try to save money
when they're setting up by using an
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fan but skipping the intake fan on
the idea that, well, when I'm sucking air
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the tent, there are enough like
little spaces between threads and areas
[SPEAKER_00]: between zippers where air gets pulled in
to, just because there's a vacuum being
[SPEAKER_00]: created inside the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that foolhardy?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be aware of what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called passive air intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you exhaust, it creates that effect
where because air is leaving, air is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: come in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is if your tent is very
sealed and it's in flour and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want any light leaks, it's going to suck
the sides of your tent in, dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is if you have a Scrog screen frame or
a PVC frame in there that you build to put
[SPEAKER_01]: a screen on, that creates a frame that
will not allow the tent to suck in
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the only side effect is a negative
pressure, which does keep it fairly clean
[SPEAKER_01]: because now the air is constantly
exhausting, any contaminants, any molds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but likely not a lot is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative to that, you can on a veg tent
open up a lot of these tents have a Velcro
[SPEAKER_01]: flap that you can roll up and it will
really let the air in so that when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausting, it comes in at a high rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's fine because a lot
of times you end up replacing these fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're constantly burning electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as long as you can get it to work,
I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you really do want to filter
that air that's coming in and put a set
[SPEAKER_01]: speed so that the tent feels like it's not
getting sucked in, the added cost of a
[SPEAKER_01]: intake fan and a filter will keep clean
air so you don't have debris and hair and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff floating into your tent that will
get onto your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a weakened immune system,
that extra step might be super important
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, all of this has been leading
up to actually growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people ask me, you know, like,
what should I grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tell people is grow what you
want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most people are usually getting into
this because there's a certain flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that they particularly like, and they want
to make sure they have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if this is specifically for their
health, they're growing the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to get the relief they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really familiar of any cultivars
that should not be grown in tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly a lot of the thinner,
taller, growing sativas, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely be aware of their height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to manage that, which we'll
talk about a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you, you know, you do a lot of
side by side testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across any cultivars which
really should not be considered for tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, stretch is the key
component and time of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your electricity is very expensive,
it would behoove you to grow something
[SPEAKER_01]: that finishes faster because the juice may
not be worth the squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if it's very affordable andâ€”or
you're blessed with an unlimited budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can look at it as growing whatever you
want because this is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference there would be,
hey, if I'm growing a really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: long flowering narrow leaf plant that's
gonna stretch a lot, I would flip it into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower almost immediately from transplant,
maybe after a few days of veg so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can be prepared for any amount of stretch
and any duration of time it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I see challenges when people
get, you know, they grow too big of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And too big of a plant leads to less
airflow and more crowding and more disease
[SPEAKER_01]: and pests and bugs and all the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to doâ€”growing for
quality, always err on the side of more
[SPEAKER_01]: room, smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you start to learn your
process, you can totally push those
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries as opposed to overdoing it the
first time and not having the bandwidth to
handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the challenges
that we're gonna run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the last set, we're gonna talk
about some advanced tent techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there's some basic stuff that
we can do to make sure that when weâ€”we
[SPEAKER_00]: either will not run into these challenges
at all, or if we do, we'll be set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the one at the top of the
list is pests, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's scared to death of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're indoor, you've got a lot
less flexibility than you do outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's already all of these natural
predators outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say one thingâ€”and we'll be
talking more about companion plants
[SPEAKER_00]: laterâ€”is to plant pests, or excuse me,
plant plants that attract, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really works best outside because
if we're running our tent properly
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, we're not gonna be attracting
anything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's gonna be sealed up and
secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really only have solutions that
occur within the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some basics that we can
follow, basic rules that we can follow so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we just don't get pests to begin
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing to consider is healthy
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in life, let's say we had the
ability to pick our genetics that probably
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent most of our problems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the ones that are out of our
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting good seeds, not a clone from a
friend, if you really have to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: clone only, it's just difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've known people that really
trust to know their friend, but until they
[SPEAKER_01]: get involved in growing, may not know
their little secrets about what poisons
[SPEAKER_01]: they use or what pests and disease they
might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start from seed, you'reâ€”you're
sure to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get a reputable breeder
with really quality seeds, itâ€”it will
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically change your first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the proper genetics,
it will resist disease and pests and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and have a good yield almost
despite you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the wrong seeds, it can make it a
lotâ€”a lot less rewarding and that may
[SPEAKER_01]: affect your ability to continue this and
sustain it versus having to buy what you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually know will produce the value for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get good seeds and you'll be off to a
great start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second to that, just like human nutrition,
there's a lot more than just what you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a good environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that means that if you focus on the
venting, the light and you get it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right temperature and the humidity is good
and you've put maybe a hygrometer
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature in there and you've checked
the hygrometer highs and lows to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have major swings, once you know
you're there, most of your problems will
[SPEAKER_01]: go away with good genetics and good
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do not discount that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have high heat and you have,
you know, really no humidity orâ€”or way
[SPEAKER_01]: high humidity all the time, that's gonna
be more important than any nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect we can cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if those are covered and we're
looking at nutrition and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wanna make sure that there's some
basics that weâ€”maybe keeping the tent
[SPEAKER_01]: clean, some basics as far as nutrition so
they don't run out because where nature
[SPEAKER_01]: likes to bring disease and pests is to
clean things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are having an unhealthy plant or
it's out of place because the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment's not right, it's just gonna
call the signal in to decompose it,
[SPEAKER_01]: have the pest eat it, and that's typically
where we get the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternative of that, like I mentioned,
is getting a clone that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually, if it's your first time,
you just don't know until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So avoid that and I think that you're
gonna avoid 99% of the pitfalls that most
[SPEAKER_01]: of your growers fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, totally agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of people assume
that pests are gonna be part of their
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growing experience and it really
doesn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are keeping the tent within
expected parameters and if you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts from your friends, because,
you know, that'sâ€”I would say that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one way that pests get introduced
is somebody's got this great plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: they give you a cut and it's got something
on it and while I'm a big fan of dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, if you have to have it, I'm way more
of a fan of not taking that cut at all and
[SPEAKER_00]: just finding yourself a quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, you know, clones are not as
vigorous as growing from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays, when we can get feminized
seeds, you know, a lot of people would
[SPEAKER_00]: skip seeds because they're like,
oh, I don't want to go through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of sexing and then cutting off of it and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a hassle, especially if you're
a patient with limited resources and time
[SPEAKER_00]: and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we're in the land of
feminized seeds, if you're really just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, you know, get something going,
one seed equaling one feminized plant
[SPEAKER_00]: really takes out a lot of the reason to go
down the clone path to even begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can clone your own and you're
good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with feminized seed, you can flower
right from seed, have very small plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and a high plant count and get a harvest
almost immediately instead of buying auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if plant count is a limiting
factor, you can treat them just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: normal plant, clone them, keep them,
do everything that you would want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very rewarding to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really agree on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing you mentioned was maybe
some preventative tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I've learned about
nature is it abhors a void.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna fill it with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we bring in this really rich
compost and this beautiful potting soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and this warm, humid environment and this
grow light, I don't care
[SPEAKER_01]: how good you are, there will be a time to
stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually put in the cover crop and the
cover crop I never let out compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always let it stay low and I'll smash it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the added benefit is it will produce
an environment that will house all these
[SPEAKER_01]: predators and it will feed them pollen and
it will feed them exudates and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things that keep them active so that if
anything ever gets in there, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole entire army ready to destroy it so
that you never have an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have two grow tents doing side by
side in a retail store in a farming
[SPEAKER_01]: environment with every known problem in
the epicenter of hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've never had an issue knock on wood
because we immediately put in road
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles, predator mites, we use good
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we have kind of a team helping
us instead of the bubble boy syndrome
[SPEAKER_01]: where it is so sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one thing gets in there, it's gonna be
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've noticed that usually organic
growers that preemptively add the worms
[SPEAKER_01]: and the beneficials, they just don't have
any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you can't afford the beneficials on
your first grow, get some good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's normally gonna be a byproduct by your
second or third cycle, you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, where did all this life come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help but laugh thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never really, you know, I follow you
on Instagram and I follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: side-by-sides that you pretty much
continually do, but it's only now
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring to me that you've got growers
from all over Colorado walking to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, coming into your store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this bug?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep those bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and you know, so many times with
new growers, the first thing that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with is fungus gnats because,
you know, I think that we all tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beneficial nematodes that you're
talking about, especially the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pronounced hypoasis nematodes
that take care of fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, you know, all three of the
categories that you suggested when they
[SPEAKER_00]: work in concert together, but you know,
if you've got limited, if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: limited budget, if you can get rid of
those fungus gnats, you can avoid them
[SPEAKER_00]: eating at your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my gosh, just the emotional distress
of fungus gnats, you know, that can dampen
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing experience itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, if your wife is in the other room
or your roommate or something and is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: why are these gnats coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a damper on things pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, they go from the grow room to
the kitchen really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the number one problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully it's not a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by your second or third cycle,
there'll be a hundred percent gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the advantage of not having to
start from scratch every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't care what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get a compost involved, there is a
chance that their favorite food,
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats favorite food is going to be that
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's possible there's a larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible that they're in the house
plants already, or somehow they get in
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of putting the hypoapsis you
meant, they changed their name to I think
[SPEAKER_01]: Stratio now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have changed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the predator mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those will eat the larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nematodes are a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea of the three was the smallest
is the nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's microscopic inside the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next was the predator mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the next size up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larger than that is the rove beetle,
which is about the size of a grain of
[SPEAKER_01]: rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you cover all three of those
sizes, you fill a knockâ€”a lot of nooks and
[SPEAKER_01]: crannies within the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get that started right away,
even if there is some gnat larva,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's never gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see a few gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll never get out of control and
eventually goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if thereâ€”if you wait until you
have the problem, it's gonna take a month
[SPEAKER_01]: or so and it's gonna take some active
participation on not excessive watering
[SPEAKER_01]: and really making sure that you consider
all the things to get rid of these gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is you can grow an entire
cycle and have bad gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only downside is they may be a
vector landing in your leaf material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go to trim, you might wanna
be conscious of that and make sure that it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't involve itself in your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the second cycle, they'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other consideration here is that even
though people may have a problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: really young plants eating the roots,
if you've got a mulch system in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna eat the debris there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna eat the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a healthy living soil, the plant
will persist almost despite the gnats no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some tricks that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can remove the entire top one or two
inches and discard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where most of the larva would be if
it gets out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could put a barrier in
temporarily, a layer of sand, a layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: something that will suffocate them out and
kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can remove the layer, put in fresh
mulch, start back up again, and normally,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll never have a problem again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's totally handleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm laughing at myself because I just
broke one of my own rules and luckily you
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected it because, you know,
as a source of information, I have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really clean about the information that I
give people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I was suggesting species of
beneficial nematodes and thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: correction just because I thought I was
repeating what I learned over the weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: at the regenerative agricultural
conference from Suzanne the bug lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, I remembered it wrong and I
had not tried them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, once you try something
yourself, then you really have experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and you can start sharing with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like all there I went and I just I
passed on information incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like one of my pet peeves is
when anybody does that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like classic bro science I just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you did a good job in the sense
that your source was a very proven source
[SPEAKER_01]: that's reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although you confused a couple of the
words, it would have led to the correct
[SPEAKER_01]: information for anyone that does their
part, which is researching whatever they
[SPEAKER_01]: receive as information to process into
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't care if I provide the
information or someone else does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a Google real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that you're doing your part
in your garden so you're never a victim of
[SPEAKER_01]: bad information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you're gonna be really
happy having your own garden and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a gateway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may end up growing your own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may end up sharing this lifestyle with
another person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell you what, it may not be your
family's favorite thing if you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: state where this is, you know,
not talked about or it's frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as they age and have pain and can't
sleep, you're gonna be the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: resource in your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: For providing relief and assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only a matter of time till people
understand how beneficial these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be clear, I want to be it was
my error in my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that whatever came out of
Suzanne, the bug lady's mouth was
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was it was my notes that were
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but to your point, you know,
I love the saying that cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway to horticulture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like so many people once they
start playing with the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: they you know, they they've got their
first cycle and like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interacted with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very short jump to to grow your own
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, heck, it will talk about this
more in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's even fun to grow lettuces and
other potential things inside your tent
[SPEAKER_00]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you once you get over the hump that
that you can and deserve to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, you know, all the doors fling
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can go down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your own Lego set with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these periodic table of elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although there's so many of them,
all they are is a mixture of energy in
[SPEAKER_01]: about nine different rotational shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow they create our entire fucking
universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can interact, if you've like
I grew up in a cul-de-sac and you plug me
[SPEAKER_01]: into this system where I'm manifesting my
own reality and transmitting a thought of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant into 3D printed version in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's a power in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you start looking
forward to the days after you plant the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and you start looking forward to
opening the tent door and it really starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to take over your life in ways that you'd
never expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do one more best practices before
we go to our second commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like pests, mold, you know,
by tritus and powdery mildew scare the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell out a lot of people for good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if you set yourself up
correctly from the beginning, your
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of having any issues decreases
greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those best practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PM and mold are the two biggest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been through both of them and they're
horrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So powdery mildew, if you've never
experienced it, it's a white mildewy kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of almost like powdered sugar looking
thing on your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's your first grow, you may even
mistake it for a lot of frost and be
[SPEAKER_01]: embarrassed to find out that it's powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prevention of this is typically having a
very healthy plant in a ecosystem that is
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And contrary to popular belief,
having high humidity will not cause
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually prevents it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The low humidity alternatively can create
a powdery mildew situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's no simple rule with
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hundreds of types of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically that PM is subject to a very
narrow range of host plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you find PM in the garden plants out
front of your house, it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a very unhealthy
environment in your garden, it is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air and it will find its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a heavily garden area,
like the Pacific Northwest, it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that if you have the wrong
environment, it will host itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost matter of fact, just like making
sourdough bread, you leave out the
[SPEAKER_01]: material, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being considered or that that
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the right environment,
that means you have airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperatures are proper and the
humidity is proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to lead to a healthy plant
that is not underwater on accident for
[SPEAKER_01]: days at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is all taken right, then that
means that the next step is to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment being flat with a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a sun going around the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a tent, as you start to maximize
the space, you're going to have to now
[SPEAKER_01]: clean up the lower legs of the plant,
remove leaves, so that there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow and you don't have a hosting spot
for moisture to sit on certain leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: where it can be a vector for disease to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you get into the flower,
the opposite is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too high of a humidity,
that can lead to actual botrytis or this
[SPEAKER_01]: bud rot, they call it, of mold growing in
a very dense, wet flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will happen if your exhaust fan
kicks off and the heat of the light goes
[SPEAKER_01]: up and the humidity goes up and you're
unaware of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it can happen if the humidity of the
lung room goes up seasonally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have had your first grow
perfect and all of a sudden, it's now in a
[SPEAKER_01]: more humid time of year and you didn't
change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a grower, as you start to cycle,
you need to be in tune with nature cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: as they affect your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you run a swamp cooler where you live,
that's a different type of season than
[SPEAKER_01]: when you don't have a swamp cooler running
because the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consider those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never have humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never have powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in the worst area,
you might want to add a weekly spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use an EM5, Dr. Bronner soap,
plain water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just want to kind of keep the
leaf surface clean of the actual powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew spore or the botrytis spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in flower, you don't want to have to
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to get the environment
right than trying to fight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are pretty much everything I'd
say about powdery mildew and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I really like the
preventative of a spray myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like using either an EM or a compost tea
because the idea is there's only room for
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunistic powdery mildew to live
on the leaf if there's not already a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: duty microbe colony already living there
that would consume the PM as soon as it
[SPEAKER_00]: lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're spraying something microbial
and healthy all through veg on a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and your leaves or the tops and
bottoms are essentially this like
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial army of microbes, as you roll
into flower, your likelihood of having to
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything during flower is the best
because of course you're going to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying because you don't want to get
your spray in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if you are diligent during
veg, the likelihood that you will have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problem during flower is astronomically
decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I mentioned having
everything proper is having sprays and
[SPEAKER_01]: having all these things will work very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you have it all wrong,
narrowing your window of opportunity down
[SPEAKER_01]: to just flower, just the last half of
flower, that'll eliminate a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can make it where the
environment is proper no matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll widen your range and I'll tell you
what those will do for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first start growing and you're up
against it and you may not consider these
[SPEAKER_01]: things we discussed today, your plant
health will decline and it's almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: can I make it to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start getting good at
itâ€“ I have lived this hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get past that and you could
literally go infinitely, you can let a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant truly ripen to its real potential
and still be in peak health and that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to really enjoy the nuances this
plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll soon find out why what's
readily available on the market is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as what you can produce yourself
based on all those nuances of preference
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to learn based on just
this growing affinity with your own
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst case scenario is that you're
about to flip to bloom and you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: problems pre-existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't want to go into bloom
with the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need to put off your flower a
little bit until you get this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: cleared up, you might as well because that
might just cost you a week or two instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of wasting all your effort by everything
falling apart during bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and just like life, nature in the
garden, it's gonna be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: condensed time frame but it's gonna teach
you lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't learn it the first time,
it's gonna get bigger and bigger and
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you notice an environmental
difference, try and fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you notice something off,
try and be considerate of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wait and put it off till tomorrow
or next week, as a grower, that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: first habit you have to get rid of and
it's gonna improve every part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take that second
short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.

[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators who grow in living soil are
very particular on what inputs they use in
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They educate themselves and painstakingly
create compost and nutritive teas to
[SPEAKER_00]: create thriving soils that will produce
the very best expression of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many living soil farmers now believe that,
over time, seeds become acclimated to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of substrate they are grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a seed that was bred in
synthetic fertilizers may not immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to do in a living soil
environment, slowing their growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regenerative seed cooperative is a
different kind of seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regenerative seed cooperative only
provide cannabis seeds that were bred in
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and using probiotic growing
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you germinate in soil,
the seed's genetics will recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and immediately start
interacting with microbes and fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are described as
bio-intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of cannabis breeders
participating in the regenerative seed
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative is rapidly increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already signed on are
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are regulars, autoflowers,
and hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: A significant amount of the profits go to
cannabis seed preservation projects
[SPEAKER_00]: available to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take every advantage that
you can when growing in beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then consider buying your seeds from the
regenerative seed cooperative at
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Jeremy Silva, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at the third set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at this point, hopefully you pretty
much understand where you need to go to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to set up your first tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been listening and you have
a tent, hopefully you have figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: some new techniques to kind of dial things
in a little bit more, because we tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: have our strong parts about tents and our
weak parts, and we just need to constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: be actively learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last set is going to be about things
that are going to be common to many,
[SPEAKER_00]: but folks getting into tents would
probably consider them advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got your tent up and
running and everything we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to up till now, you're feeling
pretty confident about, I would say you
[SPEAKER_00]: could start to consider some of these five
things that we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeremy, let's talk about topping right
off the bat, because I like what you said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, which actually kind of shivered
me timbers when you're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, why don't you try moving the plant to
flower as soon as you transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm like, the plant,
it's so small, but I want a lot of buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said, well, that way you know
you're never going to run your plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am one of those people who tends
to let my plant grow a little probably
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm dealing with it growing into
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, the only real solution I
have is I top it while it's in veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: just straight up cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this scares the hell out of just about
anybody who first starts doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please go ahead and teach us topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two things to consider when
topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't top and I don't like it,
but I do use it in a couple of instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that you hit the nail on the
head with is had you timed the flip to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower sooner, you would have not needed
to top, which means that we burn nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in light we did not need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more to consider than just the
plant shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, alternative to topping, there's other
things we'll talk about where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate the hormones in the plant to
provide the shape you're looking for if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the main goal of topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I use topping is similar to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've overdone it or they're mom plants or
whatever the case is and I need to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the advantageous way to top,
but it's still the best way to manage your
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most people when they consider
topping, they're looking at the ultimate
[SPEAKER_01]: way to increase yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that yield is related to the canopy
and the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not related to having two tops
instead of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why two tops instead of one is
more important is because your light is
[SPEAKER_01]: flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that's important is filling the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the ability to put a hundred
plants in a small space, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: full canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never need to top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can flower immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one plant and it's got to fill
your entire canopy, you might want to top
[SPEAKER_01]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two methods that I typically
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is called the FIM or fuck I missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's typically when you have the
very top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new leaf that's protruding at the
very top when it's just being made and it
[SPEAKER_01]: is a quarter inch tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get in there with scissors and you
barely nip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll get three tops out of
that, the pinnacle of the FIM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you get two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're removing very little plant
material, a very small wound, and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not really stunting the growth of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatively, if you wait too long and
you're like, oh, wow, I should have topped
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is a little too tall and you're
building like this candelabra up top that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets lopsided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you have to go down several
inches or even further to theâ€”at a crotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to just cut in the middle
of a stalk because it will decay and it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a wound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to cut near the crotch of a
branch and that will allow it to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what people will do, they'll cut
the whole top of the plant off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's calling it topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cut the whole plant of the
top off, you're removing a lot of biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: that took time to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there will be two tops but I would
have preferred to just bend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you get to leave all of that
biomass intact and still get the benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: of the shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so topping serves two purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to increase yield by getting more
branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is to reduce excessive
plant size and slow things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second category, if you have a
small container, you've already burned
[SPEAKER_01]: through nutrients that should have been
there for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take all these things in consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a large container, it almost doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just adds more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, kind of top at will but
don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you've got a whole bunch of plants
and you're sexing them, or you got a mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: all bonsai, and I'll cut entire plants
down to literally one little leaf on all
[SPEAKER_01]: the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll grow back into a full raging mom
plant within three or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, learn how far you can push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there may not be a reason to top
depending on what your needs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm normally topping because I'm like,
oh shit, I've overgrown either my tent or
[SPEAKER_00]: my hoop or whatever because, you know,
I want my plants to be, I want to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: my space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tend to get greedy and then I have
to top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I really like though is,
you know, for the folks who are topping to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize their space because they want to
be able to get rid of that one primary
[SPEAKER_00]: cola and instead make multiple colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first saw Scrogging, I'm like,
oh, this is the solution that I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for folks who have not come across it,
and I'm sure you're going to explain it
[SPEAKER_00]: better than I am, Jeremy, but essentially
you are going to stretch a net about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a third of the way up from the
bottom of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to weave your plant as
it's growing through this net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more your plant grows,
the more you're going to weave so that
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant plants remain at a uniform
height and they never grow up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring the light down to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got this, you're creating
this little field of big colas and it
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to maximize your space because
you can weave them into the corners and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can weave into empty space and you've
got all these colas that more or less are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting even light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a decent explanation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great explanation and that's the
primary purpose ofâ€”if an indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: your light is fixed and flat, to increase
the yield versus that light, you'd want
[SPEAKER_01]: the flattest canopy possible from wall to
wall covering your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, the only terminology I would
avoid using is the term weave in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't want to go above the screen
and then through the holes in your screen
[SPEAKER_01]: because as the branches grow, it can cause
a little bit of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I pull and tuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the top branch hits the screen,
instead of topping, what you'll do is
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll bend the top branch over two
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it grows through, you'll pull
it back through the screen, move it over a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is the plant,
it knows where the top of the plant is,
[SPEAKER_01]: the apicalâ€”or apical meristem by sending
theâ€”these hormones there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them that's talked about is
oxen and it's dominant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you top it, all of the hormones are
now redistributed to the lower branches
[SPEAKER_01]: and they shoot up in height.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't know though that to get
that effect of hormonal change,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you have to do is lower the apical
meristem below one of the other branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity affects the oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will lower it to the bottom of the
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will curve back up on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you bend it away from the screen,
all of the lower branches are gonna shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: up on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's amazing you cannot top,
bend and bend and bend, and the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: plant willâ€”you'll see the top from the
middle of theâ€”of your container all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to the side of the tent, but you'll
also see every lateral branch reaching to
[SPEAKER_01]: the screen fully filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if your top really gets away from you
and it never bushed out maybe because
[SPEAKER_01]: there wasn't enough nutrients or enough
light and there were kind of bean poles,
[SPEAKER_01]: topping will speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if everything's healthy and growing
fast, all you have to do is bend it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, ifâ€”if bending over is not quite
enough, you need it to like really be
[SPEAKER_01]: lowered below the other branches so that
the branches shoot up with those hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is called supercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will actually bend and pinch the stock
in two or three locations and gently bend
[SPEAKER_01]: it over, fold it like a broken straw or a
piece of cardboard so that it flops.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will temporarily shift all the
hormones to the lower branches until that
[SPEAKER_01]: top recovers in growth and resumes its
place as the main top.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this every three or four days
until all the lower branches are even,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will never go back to a top plant
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top will now become the same as all
the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're thinking about going into
Scrogging, this is absolutely something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is best taught with video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isâ€”there are so many Scrogging
videos out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not hesitate to go to YouTube and just
put in Scrog, S-C-R-O-G, and you will find
[SPEAKER_00]: way more than you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really is the place to learn this
because it's really a visual sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Scrog means screen of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the technology used instead of the
sea of green coined by Michael Wolf
[SPEAKER_01]: Siegel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you add the Scrog, you're kind of
mimicking this plant density without
[SPEAKER_01]: having to have so many plants underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very conducive to a three plant
count, six plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you use the screen to manage the
canopy to be even across your entire
[SPEAKER_01]: growth platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you research topping, you're gonna
find main lining and bending branches to
[SPEAKER_01]: this perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's fun, it takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just having more plants is the
fastest way to the glory land,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plant count can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do any of this if you're
not worried about plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plant a whole bunch and you'll be
there faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about nutrition
education sources because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can study cannabis plant nutrition
joyfully the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think is important is making
sure you have good sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are several good books out
there from nutrition for the beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through advanced microbe life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can read for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also happen to love the Probiotic
Farmers Alliance on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old days, it was this kind of
intimate group of eight or 10,000 folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's blossomed to 35,000 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quality of your information,
you've got to make sure you're listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Probiotic Farmers Alliance on
Facebook is also good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, what are some of your sources for
nutrition education that you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to read books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's not everyone's favorite way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when we... One book that
changed my life was Masanobo Fukuoka,
[SPEAKER_01]: His One Straw Revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I think it's an important
read is it's a philosophy book more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: practice, like a how-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things you glean from this
is every time I want to get too scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: in understanding everything, I'm reminded
of how successful he was by implementing,
[SPEAKER_01]: being a steward of nature instead of
trying to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I mean by that is the
simplicity can create unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is kind of balanced by the fact
that you're gonna want to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reading books, I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That One Straw Revolution is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at the next topics
you have to consider would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I just read an organic book,
they'll probably talk about compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to make compost and compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then general organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will keep you busy for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next realm that people go down the
rabbit hole on is soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a book called The Ideal Soil by
Michael Lastera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another one called The
Intelligent Gardener by Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them are excellent primers on
doing a soil test and finding balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I'll say is, you don't have to
get this perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you did do a soil test on a lot of
potting soil that you wanted to keep,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can just balance the main
weaknesses like excessive sodium or
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium or chloride or maybe just
knowing that a little calcium would really
[SPEAKER_01]: balance things, that can be a dramatic
game changer especially when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on that production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I really like just
picking up old gardening books like Ruth
[SPEAKER_01]: Stout and her No Work Gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll really make you believe in thinking
about how to do things that are simpler
[SPEAKER_01]: but produce really good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a little bookstore at
Build A Soil where we kind of put our
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite books that we've read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those sources oftentimes teach you
how to critically think where oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garden, we need to go on social
media to get a specific answer that's
[SPEAKER_01]: timely right now so that we can at least
move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So balance those two so that you don't
need so many urgent needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people read the teaming with
microbes series.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many good ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll second the teaming with
microbes series.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaming with microbes, teaming with
nutrients and then teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those books are where I learned my
vocabulary that I kind of needed to start
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into the other books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Lowenfeld is the author.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good ability to simplify things
for everybody but giving you real actual
[SPEAKER_00]: science which probably comes from him
writing a gardening column for 45 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will second your teaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also on the other end of the scale,
once you've exhausted all of your books,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a great new certification I like
from Elaine Ingham that she's just
[SPEAKER_00]: launched on her website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a few thousand dollars to do it but
it's the kind of education that once you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a certification, you could actually
start professionally consulting for other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a whole bunch of excellent
nutrition resources for you to consider as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get more into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's quite a few reasons why
polyculture is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who are new to the word,
polyculture is just simply means you have
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one plant growing in your
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what nature is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants are all growing together in
the same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows them to communicate about what
pests are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows them to share nutrients and
microbe life beneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when I have it in, when I have
other plants that are in my tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, I've got short grasses because I'm
really into living green mulches because
[SPEAKER_00]: it keeps the top of the soil more moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I also just love flowers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent looks good when there are flowers
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me happier to tend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts, Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I agree with everything you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only caveat that I'll put on that is
you mentioned Elaine Ingham recently and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a huge topic that we went through
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought microscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did dissolved oxygen, altitude adjusted,
temperature adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bought all sorts of different meters
beyond that just to figure out how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the best compost tea following Ingham and
Tim Wilson and the Hue season and really
[SPEAKER_01]: going down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to share with you,
maybe incorrect, maybe I'll change my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind, but I think that if you implement
regenerative agriculture and companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and cover crops and worms and
predator mites, all of the biology will
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of itself despite you and nature
will find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how nature has done it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost like if you, for instance,
if you've seen that movie, The Littlest
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Farm, I think it's called,
when they wanted to get owls at the
[SPEAKER_01]: property to help with a problem they had,
they just put up a birdhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't try to construct an owl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you build the home for the microbes
and you put in the cover crop and you use
[SPEAKER_01]: these practices that nature uses,
you will have an unbelievable biology
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have so much control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great environment, good inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only caveat to that is if you just
overwater like crazy, you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some concerns there,
but for the most part, if you use cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, it's gonna be significantly harder
to overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can leverage these tactics to help
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like cover crop because they're
typically types of plants that fix
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen and improve soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can research.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out about which one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors, I will say, the main limiting
factor is try and find stuff like you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want a three-foot tall nitro radish
that's gonna grow in your container,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want maybe clover and grasses and
things like that that won't overtake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst case, if it takes anything over,
just chop it down and feed it back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: worms in your container.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cover crop recipe that we made.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Build A Soil, it's been really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say that what led me to
building that blend was having diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 12 different seeds,
lots of clovers and different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use one type of seed and find
great success, but I think that building a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological community in there,
diversity, diversity, diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll have a really good result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy all your favorite seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow radishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only caveat with food is that
sometimes food requires a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have no airflow and light down
there, it may like have rotten lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where beets might do great, or radishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consider those things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your primary crop is primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is secondary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Jeremy, I know you and I
share a love of having flowers alongside
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard you wax philosophic and
poetic about flowers before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you give us a little bit of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about it, I think that obviously
there's a beauty there and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of philosophy around just the beauty of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And awakening and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at a garden,
there's this certain connective nature
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have where it's been around
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why humans are
gravitated towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have an indoor oasis that's
created and you walk in and peak flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in a bigger grow room where
there's lights crossing over each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cover crops growing out the side
and it's lush and it's weaving its way
[SPEAKER_01]: down and there's pink clover flowers and
there's flax vining up the bottom and
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting flowers off next to your cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost puts you in that Garden of Eden
type feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something that's so natural
there that's so pervasive like into
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's mind, it'llâ€”it just gets you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why a lot of people
kind of make fun of the cover crops is
[SPEAKER_01]: they think we just do it because it's
pretty or because it looks cool or we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be cooler than our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, when you understand
that it can move water around,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your soil tilled and provide biology
and sugars and fix nitrogen, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of reasons to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the beauty of it is really
half the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's finish on this last
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have become, you know,
maybe not an expert in your tent grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that you're, you know, you're not
crashing your tent grows and you decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to expand, a lot of people
like to move to keeping a separate veg
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and bloom tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's fantastic to be able to have
your tent and veg and then just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: change the light cycle and now you're
flowering in the same tent, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic for space concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you are, say,
for example, a patient and you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to constantly be making cannabis oil
for yourself to get relief, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe if you're just like a
serious toker, right, and you go through a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of flower, a lot of people like to
expand to a second tent and have one
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated to vegging and keeping the
cultivars that you like so you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to get cuts from your friends and you can
really hone, you know, you can keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos that you particularly like of seeds
and then your other tent is just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly blooming and that way you can,
you know, you can harvest some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: while other ones are earlier in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on having two
tents, Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think it's the only way to go
and there's a number of key reasons you
[SPEAKER_01]: hit on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is that this will take the
focus off maximizing yield because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on maximizing quality, yield will
come, especially cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you are only having one tent,
that means that you're gonna grow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain size, you're going to turn the
timer down to 12 hours a day or less so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it triggers them into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you understand that, you know that
now flowering is gonna take 60 to 90 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the cultivar, some sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beyond that, you're going to have
to have, after you harvest, now grow more
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging plants, switch back, that takes
time before you ever go into flower again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, that means your yield
needs to be higher, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second problem is that means that
you're only gonna be relying on those
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors that you're able to grow for that
longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're a heavy cannabis user,
having different cultivars is paramount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is that even if you
have your favorite, it will dull itself on
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that interacts with your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a different strain will
increase the effect and going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth between two, three or four can
dramatically improve the way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: measure and dedicate as far as being a
productive person and having different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you start to get that dialed in,
having two tints means that you can now be
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetually flowering like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that looks like is creating your
plants that are gonna go in the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room, and the flower room is ever on a
12-hourâ€”it's always on 12 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that no matter what,
when you put a plant in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna start to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that that's attractive because
in your small space you can have one
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing flower while another one is just
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say nature does not do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hormones that they put off next to
each other and the chaos of having
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple plants at many different age
cycles while worth it is more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've had a lot of success having
containers where one's finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, the next one moves to its spot,
and it's done in two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you harvest a plant every week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what that leads to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leads to poor drying and curing because
you always need that next plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: you never had enough and you're tasting
the lowers and finally waiting for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and now you gotta wait two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get a big harvest and then get
another plant going right after that in
[SPEAKER_01]: two tenths and you will actually be able
to do a slow dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the best medicine with constant
flavor changes and instead of going
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetual, you can actually shut your
flower downâ€”room down, clean it
[SPEAKER_01]: completely, spick and span, and you can
move veg plants in there and veg for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week if you want in their new home or you
can switch right to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having that cycle is better than
perpetual because it leads to consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistent success is a bigger yield
because you don't have a problem cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never given as much thought as I
just heard from you about the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: having plants in flower at different parts
of the cycle because you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the plants are constantly
talking to each other with terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: other subtle botanical chemicals and if
one thinks it's October and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant thinks it's September, I can see how
that could cause some biochemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be nothing there and I could be
overthinking it but one of the tenants of
[SPEAKER_01]: successful natural farming is to try to
mimic nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This invariably leads to the joke,
well, why don't you just throw a seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: your backyard and see what nature does
with it and I've had success doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I admit we can be better stewards so it's
not just completely being blind to that
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's something there when you start
to observe nature and internalize that for
[SPEAKER_01]: your own benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing, now that there are decent
auto flower seeds out there, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about if you have room in your veg
tent to be running an auto flower in there
[SPEAKER_00]: as well since if you've got your veg tent
at 18.6, an auto flower is happy to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: up mature and flower in 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a good use of space if
folks have got it and I've tried it a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it's ancillary,
it's extra, it's not like what you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now auto flowers have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's reasons for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be that people villainize them
because they had to be basically hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in its background which
supposedly would lower the potency and I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that but now that we know more
about hemp and we know more about plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that this could be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have more CBD right away in an
auto flower and have this balance but the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge I had is you can't clone them
which means you can't keep your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: if you find it which leads to sadness
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you might pop a hundred seeds and
they get every single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them might be a three ounce plant
and the next one might have one gram and
[SPEAKER_01]: that frustration can lead to me saying,
hey, throw a couple in your veg tent and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a blast because now you're not
dependent upon it and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration is where I live here in
Colorado, all the hemp is going crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: which means you cannot grow outdoor
anymore because of the pollen but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light depth or auto flower,
pull them down before any pollen is flying
[SPEAKER_01]: and leverage the free sun and that's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jeremy, this has been a really great
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful snapshot to get people
going intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing your time
and vast experience with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really fun and a lot of times in
the day to day, you forget how many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these questions were really the most
important thing when we first got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to find out more about
Jeremy Silva and build a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two really great places to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost is their website at
build a soil.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's build a soil.com and then I got
to tell you Jeremy's Instagram is easily
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite three in the whole
scene because he spends a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: doing videos from the shop with these
fantastic side by side tent grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much and I learned so much
I'm doing wrong from these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you check out
their Instagram at build a soil and he
[SPEAKER_00]: also let me know that coming up here in
March, he's got a 12 episode series
[SPEAKER_00]: actually very similar to this episode
you're listening to where he's going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the key aspects of building a
tent and I believe that they're all like
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes or so each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's build a soil.com and at build a
soil on Instagram.
