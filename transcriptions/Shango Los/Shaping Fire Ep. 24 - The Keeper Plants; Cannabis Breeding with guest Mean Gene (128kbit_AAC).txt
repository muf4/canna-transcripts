[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days, cannabis primarily
tasted and smelled like it did due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, climate, and genetics of the region
of the world that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, we primarily
received flower from Mexico, but flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: from other Latin American countries
certainly showed up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarely, but sometimes, we were able to
delight over something especially exotic
[SPEAKER_01]: from Afghanistan or Thailand, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, though, enough bag seeds found
its way into the hands of cannabis lovers
[SPEAKER_01]: who also had the mind and resources to
grow them locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders all over the world began to cross
and hybridize these cannabis chemovars to
[SPEAKER_01]: create unique plants that had their own
taste, growing patterns, colors,
[SPEAKER_01]: and medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_01]: This breeding happened both indoors and
outdoors, but due to prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding was mostly done indoors in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders hybridized plants to tease out
the most wonderful attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet, sour, earthy, skunky, and fuel
tastes all became more pronounced once
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders got involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders also selected for mold
resistance, size, overall health,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so many other attributes that a
particular grower thought might be
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dedication to craft is why cannabis
breeders are revered and why modern
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is so badass compared to the
stuff we grew up on.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Mean Gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean Gene is a legendary cannabis breeder
from Mendocino in the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: region of Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is owner of cannabis genetics company
Freeborn Selections, but is most known for
[SPEAKER_01]: his epic collaborations with aficionado
seeds like the black lime reserve strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're gonna talk about Mean Gene's
breeding practices, naming conventions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that epic black lime strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to the show, Mean Gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you could make some time to
be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I was getting set for this
show, the first thing I noticed is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I actually thought that your
primary association was with aficionado
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds because everywhere I've gone,
it's always like, you know, Mean Gene from
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after I got the opportunity to start
following your Instagram feed for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that the imprint that you are
primarily responsible for is actually your
[SPEAKER_01]: own Freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you kind of like break it down
for us, like how you work between
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado versus Freeborn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, basically, you know,
Leo from aficionado was somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was living right on the same road
as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he won the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I said, well,
these guys look like they have some good
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I messaged them,
I think, on Facebook to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, can I pick up some of your
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wound up meeting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, those guys saw what I had
and they were like, yeah, do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some kind of a release through
aficionado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stuff is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we started collaborating
on a little bit of stuff here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put out a Black Lime Reserve and
the In the Pines and the Versailles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave them the the Red Hindu Kush F3
that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about the only ones that we
really put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's, you know, those are the
ones that people, you know, like Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime Reserve was a was a big, huge hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was going to be good because I
really like Black Lime myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we put that one out,
that one got a lot of really good press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did I think it was there was
like six hundred and fifty entries or
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, was it 2014, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took second place with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people really know me from from my
work with aficionado more than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else, because those are the those are
really the only seeds that I've publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: released other than me and Braveheart from
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a a little giveaway that was a
Nubia, which is a CBD plant cross with
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Harla Sue from Ringo at Soham
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing out the seeds
and have grown out the seeds that I make
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if for anybody to really know me for
having ever got any of my seeds at a club
[SPEAKER_00]: or anywhere else, those would have been
aficionado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really why people, you know,
if you ask, oh, mean gene, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go, oh, yeah, aficionado Black Lime
Reserve in the pines and those ones that I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lucky thing that you chose somebody
good to work with when you won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you're going to be
associated with somebody, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Leo and aficionado is like, you know,
that's that's somebody great to be
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with, even if it was,
you know, just for for a couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was funny because they
won in 2012 and then I came in in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 and I took third and then 2014 I took
second and then 2000, 2015, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: I took first place in the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny because after a while,
people started to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys win every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way that you can just win every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was actually one of
those things where I was I was actually it
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have people say, oh, the contest is
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You win too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was about seven or eight episodes
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had your neighbor, Alan Atkinson,
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was telling us that you
live on the same mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he said, he says, yeah,
man, he says like, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can throw a rock in like, you know,
you know, hit all of these cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_01]: winners that live all around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like there's some kind of
magic on that mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking for a location for
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there's a really
interesting thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's the whole people
have finally started to kind of open their
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes lately to the whole question of torwa
and and, you know, basically location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will say, oh, it doesn't
matter because if you're growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: potting soil, then that doesn't even it
doesn't even location doesn't even play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting about this part of
California is that if you go all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the to the extreme coastal zone,
your flowers will basically produce mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf and they'll produce a lot of resin
and they'll produce a lot of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'll have very little density and
they'll they'll be very lightweight and
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants will grow really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not good for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the for smoke ability stuff is really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when you come a couple of miles
back and then you start to get into areas
[SPEAKER_00]: like Comchi, Branscombe a little bit
further inland, then that would be maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like Leggett, you know, the west side of
Garberville and Redway and areas like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, even a little further west and
closer to the coast would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these little these little
areas and every area has something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from looking at it over the years and
being in different places, I've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a correlation where you look at
what is when you get farther away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: coastal influence, what happens is your
flowers they have smaller features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of the flower is smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems are thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every everything is basically smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the trichomes even become shorter and
more closely clustered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an interesting thing that
happens where when you go to the coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets larpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go inland, it gets so hard that
when you go to break it up to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, roll a joint, it actually breaks down
in almost a undesirable way where the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers themselves are so dense that when
it breaks up, it almost turns into powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go over to the coast,
then it breaks up into these big chunks
[SPEAKER_00]: where every every piece is this big,
big piece, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm right at a place where I get
the benefit of the coastal influence that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes it to grow really big, well-defined
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get the really big, tall,
thick trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have the advantage of being
far enough inland that my flowers still
[SPEAKER_00]: are dense and they look nice to people who
are into that look of something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually got a nice, dense, round look to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really interesting because
people will say, OK, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just either it's a coincidence or
it's a fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, either it has nothing to do with
anything scientific because it just is
[SPEAKER_00]: random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there happens to be a lot of people in
this area who have award-winning cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or they say, oh, well, they just give it
to somebody who they know from that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people don't understand in a lot
of cases is that the way that people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim from the Emerald Cup or the judges
from the Emerald Cup, I met those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: because I, you know, I mean, I knew Tim
from years and years back, but we weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't hang out together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he he might have known who I was a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality was that those people got
to know me because they went, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had some really good, really good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I started to know those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's how it happens when you
run an event like that and then you meet
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have really outstanding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go, oh, well, you're the
one with the they obviously have an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having a contest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it happens that there winds
up being in this little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, people here have really
been holding a lot of the best genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular town in this county is a
place where a lot of really, really good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff has has come out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so you have the genetics
advantage, you have the advantage of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who have experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I was saying about the
climate is you have this one little area
[SPEAKER_00]: where you get the best of both worlds,
where you have the coastal influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not enough to to take away from the
quality as far as, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, it's got the look and it's got
the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you go ahead and you go
over one mountain over to the east,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have a lot heavier flowers and
you'll get a lot bigger yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to break it down to roll
up a joint, when they go to smoke it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, it doesn't break down the way that
like nice indoor will break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like it's compressed because
it grows so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, for me, if I'm looking
for the ideal climate, I really like
[SPEAKER_00]: places like, you know, just to the east of
Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The east side of Garberville, the east
side of Redway, right here where it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino, along these ridges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these certain areas that really
will produce produce the type of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it the most smokable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wouldn't matter, say,
for something like concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the actual in a flower contest,
there's a certain texture that just breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it rolls up better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so certain strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a less strain that has less
dense floral clusters and you grow that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the east of me, then it'll get dense
enough to where, OK, well, maybe someone
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel might be coming from the east
and that might do better than something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I grow it here, it's not
really dense enough to get the to win the
[SPEAKER_00]: points on the look in the contest,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's different things and
there's certain strains that do better in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain climates, just like with grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow one type of grape,
you're going to want one type of of you
[SPEAKER_00]: want a certain temperature on the nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the year is not as good,
then it's not as good of a it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: good of a year for a certain a certain
type of wine, you know, and certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then, of course, you know,
then the soil goes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people use potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the big that's the big point
everybody has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't matter where you do it if
you're using potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, climate's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run an indoor room and you keep it
slightly more humid, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have flowers that are going to be not so
ridiculously dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you run it a very, very arid
environment, you're going to have stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you grow purple oracle,
you look at it and you can't even tell
[SPEAKER_00]: where the features are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I can't tell where anything
is at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like somebody put it to smashed
it all to get grounded up and smashed it
[SPEAKER_00]: back together because every little feature
has grown to be so petite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take that one more step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so you're talking about breeding the
superior flower for for a cup and for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you and your friends to toke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does that play into the breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, you're choosing,
you know, your your key males and females
[SPEAKER_01]: in this, you know, kind of Olympic
training environment that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: these flowers in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and but then, you know, you're you're
passing on this gear to people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be growing it all over the
country and indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, do you what do you what
do you consider when you're growing it on
[SPEAKER_01]: your property, which is pretty much a
perfect place to grow when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: considering the gear that you're going to
pass around to others so that so that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it doesn't need to have such a
perfect environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that that's that's another
interesting thing, too, is that as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great environment, environment for
something that will do well in a contest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also an area where things have to be
really, really hardy and they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really weather resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like if a strain is is
prone to powdery mildew, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show in this area because we do start to
get the fog at the end of September where
[SPEAKER_00]: other places won't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we do get, you know, this is this
is like considered like a temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest here, especially when there
used to be more redwoods in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area, you know, this year,
I think I mean, this is just a rough
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we got maybe 100 or 110 inches
of rain here this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started in the end of September
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that does well here,
it's going to have a pretty good shot at
[SPEAKER_00]: doing well for people in most climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I have something and it really
does great for me here, somebody in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: or Washington where the weather is even
worse there, it's still going to do better
[SPEAKER_00]: than a lot of stuff they might get because
because of how the weather is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to if, say, I was an outdoor
guy and I was in I was in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California or I was in Nevada or,
you know, if you were at a low,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it just it's it's we're at a
fairly high elevation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fairly coastal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything as I go through,
I really try to look at, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: how would this do for somebody in a more
extreme climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to really go for things that are
hardy in all ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that's made
me wind up with strains that are so high
[SPEAKER_00]: in terpenes because terpenes are oily and
strains that produce a lot of oil tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little bit better in in, say,
the rain or the fog, because they're it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like it's like water off a duck's
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the rain falls on them and it
just it just comes off, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yeah, it's interesting because it's
such a great climate for the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it is kind of a challenging
climate as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a survival of the
fittest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, if it does well on your
property, it's going to be thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the turps are high because it's
got a really strong immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it's attractive, attractive to
our human nose, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, you know, the combination of of
the difficulty and also the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your terroir means that that the strains
that you're breeding are probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be pretty good, you know, pretty
bulletproof just about anywhere unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: change temperature humidity in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost kind of like a like a magical
thing, you know, to look at it and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, there's all these things that
have come together to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to to to lead things down the path that
they've gone down because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's everything's been underground for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't necessarily know like
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my people at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people still are, you know,
saying, oh, Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, these different places where
people know about a lot of weed or even
[SPEAKER_00]: like Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt has been known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendocino and Humboldt, Trinity,
Sonoma, Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really been a lot of really great
strains that have come out over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like part of it comes from the
people who live here, according course,
[SPEAKER_00]: have more experience and do more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think also the climate of this area,
like I said, you know, if you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, if your weed is greasy,
it does better in the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we have a little bit of
a more extreme climate, I think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that in all of these areas,
that might be that might be pushing that a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's go ahead and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Mean Gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master cannabis breeder at Freeborn
Selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis normalization sweeps the
country, knowledge of how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally and without synthetic inputs has
become more and more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, probiotic growers are
experiencing large yields and exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles without using chemicals
banned in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move away from the risks inherent to
chemical nutrients and instead invest in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your soil again and again,
reducing costs and improving the vitality
[SPEAKER_01]: of your soil with each cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep It Simple Organics has been a leader
in aerated compost teas for years and now
[SPEAKER_01]: provide premium soils and nutrients to the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They offer a full line of all natural
inputs for building your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding microbe communities and brewing
nutrient and compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can even help you test your soil to
spot deficiencies that may be holding you
[SPEAKER_01]: back.

[SPEAKER_01]: Visit kisorganics.com and grow healthy,
thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes though the best parts are buried
inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the expanded Eden team has been
designing and building industry leading
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions for cannabis extraction ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you're buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braddock talk about the company's values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'll be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash Eden
to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is Mean Gene, master cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder at Freeborn Selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gene, before the break, we were talking
about the importance of weather and
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir there on your very specific
mountain where you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, a lot of people take your
seeds and they bring them indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it begs the question,
you know, do you have a part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding process that comes indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you do any sifting indoors or
are you doing all your sifting outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, in certain cases,
it's nice to do certain work with clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been proven again and again
indoors to be really stable because then
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you know that you're at least
getting part of your gene pool is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from something that's tried and true
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little bit of breeding indoors or
in a like an indoor outdoor kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, meaning that it's like,
you know, like a green, a winter
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse with supplemental lighting,
which I honestly think is better for
[SPEAKER_00]: stress testing for indoors than actual
indoor scene because it's a lot harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the environment really dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it really swings.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get, you know, you will get those
lower temperatures and you will get some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a little bit harder to
keep it like you know, if I if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: running an indoor, it's really easy to go,
OK, I'm 76 degrees all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's cool for me because indoor
where I live has kind of gone it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gone out years and years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people who do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as people were able to grow
out in the open in the sun and the prices
[SPEAKER_00]: started coming down for people,
what started to happen is it became a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient for people to start running
light depths and running greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: running outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do basically is I try to
breed stuff outdoor because in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, if it does, if it if it does
good indoor, it's going to do great
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like I said, if I'm starting with some
of those genetics, you know, different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, OGs or Master Kush, Hindu Kush,
different things that that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they do perform well indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I incorporate those into stuff
that I have coming from outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the genetics that I had that
were coming from outdoor were Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you take them and you put them
indoor, they do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the stuff that the stuff that
has more of a problem going indoor is I
[SPEAKER_00]: ironically, the stuff that's coming from
indoor, like the chem dog, the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, some of the OG Girl Scout cookies,
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things that, you know,
even when you bring them into an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program, you go through them and
you go, oh, some of these here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they you stress them a little bit and they
they go intersex on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what I do is I is I mainly
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor because if it looks really good
outdoor and it smokes really good outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody takes it indoor,
if they do it the right way, indoor has
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to have a little bit more of
what like what I always call like the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfume on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you grow outdoor OG, it's very
earthy and robust and it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a great smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But good indoor OG has this little added
little spectrum of terpenes that seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up that are detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little shinier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little the resin tends to look a
little bit more light colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to find the stuff that when I
when I breed it outdoor, it looks almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's indoor, you know, and I won't
say like, oh, this will pass for indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's in that ballpark, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what I do is I'll have people go
ahead and grow them out indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I've seen so far,
a population that you can grow really
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed outdoor or in a greenhouse and it
stays stable and doesn't show any signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take that and a good grower grows
it indoor, it's going to do just as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as sexual stability indoor as it
does outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that I have that is problematic
indoor is problematic outdoor if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed, you know, if it's overwatered,
if it's too hot in a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, for breeding, I do pretty well
being able to do it all outside and then
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of testing inside, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I enjoy doing
is over the winter, I'll I'll play with
[SPEAKER_01]: some some new seeds and strains that I've
never used before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't see what they do
indoors, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: for my own head, I really like the terpene
profiles that come from full on sunshine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my LEDs are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all sorts of really nice
attributes of growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's kind of like training
in Olympian, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're training for a very specific thing
and I can control everything and I end up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting this good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like that little bit of a,
you know, that wild outdoor taste from the
[SPEAKER_01]: broader spectrum of the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whatever I find over the
winter that I love the best, I'll take it
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and see it express itself that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's just a fun
thing of being able to go indoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor, that you can see both
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what you mean about the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like personally for me,
I only know a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of growers and there's only a
few people whose indoor is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to smoke above outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, a lot of people say,
okay, indoor is always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm like, if I'm gonna see 100
samples of indoor and 100 samples of
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, I'm probably gonna like five of
the outdoor and two of the indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because outdoor, everything just kind of
thrives and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indoor, a lot of times stuff is just
really washed out and you can tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's too much heat and it just doesn't
look, it doesn't look like it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens a lot, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed outdoor, although
indoor, the resin might be more visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the outdoor, it's actually
more of these thick, almost like sheets of
[SPEAKER_00]: resin where the trichomes are almost
sticking together in like globs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, for me, like if I smoke
indoor, I'm gonna be high for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke outdoor, and of course it's
genetics or it's hugely dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff, no matter what, it's gonna get
you high for like four hours if it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: some crazy haze or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like the high from the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it really, just hits me and it
stays and I can really feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just like this little rush of
stuff, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also find that, you know,
I still consider myself a novice grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and growing outdoors is just so much more
forgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make simple mistakes indoor and
end up with big problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoor, you know, you've got pest
predators naturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the sunshine to help you with
some of the molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as I don't have, you know,
extensive fog, I know I'm gonna be in
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good shape outdoors, whereas
indoor, something can go bad fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like outdoor, the
environment is forgiving enough that as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you handle it and dry it
correctly, you know, as long as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: properly dried and handled, you're gonna
have something that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're indoor, it's almost like
the whole process of flowering is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room, you know, outside your stuff
can be budding and it gets up to 90
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing indoor and your room
is hitting 90 degrees all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like when your weed is finally done,
it's just gonna be, you know, it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just there's nothing
substantial anymore about the about the
[SPEAKER_00]: residence profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like when I stay in the sun
too long, you know, like, oh, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go take a cold shower somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, every breeder has got
those specific cannabis plant attributes
[SPEAKER_01]: that turn them on the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you know, it's a regional thing
and it's also a breeder thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you look for when choosing plants
that excite you that you want to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: further?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, for me, it's like
experience leads me a lot like I can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a plant and go, oh, that's one of those
plants that gets the big buds all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the plant or that's one of those
plants that doesn't need a lot of support
[SPEAKER_00]: or that's one of the ones that's shaped
that certain way where I know it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get tons and tons of buds all
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, the main thing for me as far
as like what what defines the quality of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain is really what do you wind up with
in your bag when it's all said and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, what I want is the ones that
have that crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really, you know, I mean, for a lot of
people, it's all about, well, is it is it
[SPEAKER_00]: stony?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it do to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect that mindset a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, honestly, for us growing up
here, like when we were smoking a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would smoke so much that it wasn't a
matter of, OK, well, we only have this
[SPEAKER_00]: four grams of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high is it going to get us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really got into flavors and smells a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the I really like the
flower just for aesthetics, aside from
[SPEAKER_00]: actually consuming it or doing anything
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to sit and I like to hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the same way people like like cut
flowers, like if you like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever tuberose or gardenias or you
know, whatever kind of flowers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: nice just because you can sit and smell
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of I think a weed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to I want usually to have it be
something where when I have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy how it looks and then I
really enjoy how it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the ones that are really
special in that if you smelled them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't know it was weed, you might not
know that that was a weed smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's that that leads me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it comes down to on top of OK,
what is it in the bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also what is it in the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it fun to grow or is it a nightmare
to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so anything that's where I
say that's why I say experience has led
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I look at a plant and I go,
oh, this one's going to be a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: butt, you know, or this one's going to be
a dream and I'm going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to go work with these plants every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have something and I say,
oh, I like this one, you can bet that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to be fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be fun to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also going to be fun to have it
dried in your bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your your Black Lime Reserve was,
you know, a home run by anybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm grateful to have been able to
sample it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it's got that bright
lime and coconut and fruit over over like
[SPEAKER_01]: a bed of like soothing earth and moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it plays both ends of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like, you know, like when you
when somebody says, can you taste the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, maybe I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the lime, it's like, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it's like a,
you know, a green popsicle out of the out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fridge that that you're that out of
the freezer that that point, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what what what went into that,
you know, because since it's probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that, you know, I would say
nationally, you're probably most
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just just gives us a little bit of
background of the Black Lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the deal with that was that that
release was a clone that I keep that I
[SPEAKER_00]: call Lime number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is is is it's a PK,
the OG type, because there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one I used was a OG type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I crossed it with what I called
Black Lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Black Lime was, was I I had these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had these seeds and I got them,
I think, 96 or 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the two different kinds of seeds and
one of them, I was working with my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: and he actually got one side of it,
which was an old strain that was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of chemical smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really deep, really heavy,
a lot of skunkiness, really toxically
[SPEAKER_00]: stony to the point where like if somebody
is drinking alcohol, like smoking that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a no no, like four beers and two hits of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably going to be laying in
the bushes throwing up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called it Pog for purple,
orange and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't come up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was old genetics that were
that were that came from my family in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s and got recycled through a couple of
people and then came back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was kind of like just
the regular stuff to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really, you know,
I didn't really hold it at a high value
[SPEAKER_00]: because none of it was pure anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had become this old oil can strain
crossed with which was a which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Oaxacan Afghani crossed with the northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them for years and this guy did
this breeding and then me and my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that side of it, which is this
really deep, heavy, nasty, gross thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just crazy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then I had I worked for for
another friend of mine and I was silk
[SPEAKER_00]: screening people's trim back then to make
them hash, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pressing the hash and people
were like, whoa, this is like old school
[SPEAKER_00]: hash from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this is like I started doing
this in like 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy from Lebanon showed us how to do
it, how to press it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, oh, that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can press it because, of course,
if you have really good hash, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: press anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he showed us how to press anything
basically that could be pressed to make
[SPEAKER_00]: dark, sticky, nice hash using heat and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went through the guy's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm going through, I go,
hey, there's some seeds in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these good?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he goes, yeah, I'll give you
some other seeds, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want them, you know,
I mean, you can try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, but they're nothing I did on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what they really are?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a rounding error for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I take the I take the one I take the
one and I take the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the Paul guy knows good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one which at the time I didn't
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew it was like Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and later on, I found out there was
northern lights in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even more recently, only like
last year, I was talking to the guy I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to a friend who had been talking
to the guy I got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, hey, did you know he had used
the the the old Burmese in there from so
[SPEAKER_00]: and so?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, no, I never he never told me
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, yeah, he goes, we went
further down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got down the wormhole or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, then all of a sudden,
you know, this more info pops out and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got the Burmese in there, the old Branscom
Burmese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that made a little bit of sense,
too, for there to be something else in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was so exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other thing was always like
grapefruit or cranberry or lime or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just always really nice, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the ones I knew were pretty
good because the Pog, my buddy had bred a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times and he said, oh,
these are all really good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did a seed patch garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was I went, OK,
well, here's the here's the one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep the males from these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the one that came out of that
shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and get rid of those
males because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come
out of this stuff, because the guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it to me, he said he didn't know,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he only grew one thing, but he just
wasn't he is like, yeah, probably not my
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably the more wimpy ones
because you got to focus somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I get those and I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the ones that were the citrusy
ones, I got a couple of really nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, beautiful plants that were just what
I would have wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, the worst plant
in the whole thing that was one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that if you looked at all the plants,
and you go, OK, well, there's a dozen of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of the weakest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that wound up smelling
like it smelled like Thai lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like you're like buck up camper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it was it was basically like,
OK, well, and typically in breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I do things is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get boys that are really,
really really weak or there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really don't like about them,
I'll go ahead and kill males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and this is for open pollinations,
of course, I do selective line breeding to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you only use one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, it was just we were just
trying to make a whole bunch of seed with
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff and just kind of see what we
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wound up kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound I wound up killing all the males
from the citrusy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the feely stuff, I wound up
keeping maybe three or four males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of them there and I
killed most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so when I have females,
even if the females look bad, I keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: just in case they have something really
cool because it's not going to water down
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene pool because it's easy to keep
the seeds from a female separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a lot of males together,
you can't keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their pollen is all going to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas I call a lot of the male
population, I don't call out much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's something really bad about
them, like maybe if they get like a stem
[SPEAKER_00]: rot or something that I just I just don't
want to have nothing to do with even
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm willing to grow the plant one
time and it's a female, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just this wimpy little
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its buds, when they were finished,
were only about as big around as my thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them were long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had these tiny little leaves and
these thin little stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a it was a Burmese
throwback judging by what was in every
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets all the way to the end and it
gets this incredible smell to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still my favorite smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a ton of them in there
because the lime was the cross of this
[SPEAKER_00]: weird plant that was there and it was
already kind of a sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had crossed it with something
that was in a totally different world of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, what ended up happening was I
labeled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I labeled all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had like tall purple, tall purple
cranberry, tall, green, fat northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one plant, it smelled like
lime and it turned black in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the package of seeds, which was a
bag of seeds that, you know, geez,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a lot, you know, as a lot of seeds
I made, it was a whole imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a whole garden full of six
foot plants and they're all fully seeded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a release right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so that's what it wound up getting
labeled as as the black so that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: know which plant it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this was the plant that smelled like
lime and it was in a turn black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the name black lime came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, oh, what's going to what
are people going to really think is cool
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, it's just it's just off of
my label, which is how most of my names
[SPEAKER_00]: come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I write them down for reference for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people ask what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only name for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the name sticks, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wound up taking a male out of
that population when I planted some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, because the females came out really
good and I didn't really expect them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were they were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like the best stuff I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started there started to be
the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went, well, let me take some of
my different males and throw them on O.G.s
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if I get anything to come out O
.G., which I didn't because all my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: was so dominant over the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wound up with this basically with a
plant that had that did really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it it it wasn't O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had all of the all of the terpene
profile from from the middle ground of the
[SPEAKER_00]: of the black lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has this really heavy chemical funk
earth moss thing, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has all this really beautiful
floral limey citrus zest stuff going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's that's why it wound up
being such a such an odd thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I really I took two things that
were really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like peanut butter and bacon or,
you know, it was it was a weird thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for sharing that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes a lot of sense,
too, because the the flower that I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's it's this kind of,
you know, blackish bluish, almost
[SPEAKER_01]: iridescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice to hear the background
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go ahead and take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Mean Gene,
master cannabis breeder at Freeborn
[SPEAKER_01]: Selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_01]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy and affordable to
[SPEAKER_01]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse designed in operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of northern California for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are new to light depth and growing
in greenhouses, I encourage you to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to Shaping Fire Episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light depth techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: From temperature and airflow to light
depth and workflow, Forever Flowering will
[SPEAKER_01]: help you produce crop after crop of well
cared for flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light depth and other
[SPEAKER_01]: modern systems at a level that fits your
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_01]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.

[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes sold by True Terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_01]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_01]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_01]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our guest this week is Mean Gene,
master cannabis breeder at Freeborn
[SPEAKER_01]: Selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gene, you know, I know that you've done
some runs with aficionado, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado stuff is all, you know,
ultra premium elite and also in limited
[SPEAKER_01]: edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that is an interesting
aspect of it because it makes the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves more valuable, but it also
keeps it out of the hands of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just curious what your thoughts are
on the limited nature of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you attracted to the idea of a
limited run so it's a little more rare,
[SPEAKER_01]: or was that mostly just because that's the
aficionado premium model to release?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's actually a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a double-edged sword with
doing stuff limited, but it's a concept
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was supportive of because I've
noticed over the years that if things are
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit harder to get, people tend to
value them more highly and take them more
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously, which from a preservation point
of view, because that's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm really concerned with things
staying around because I've seen so much
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff just be gone and you never see it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I feel like if somebody gets a
pack of seeds and they know that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: only ever a couple hundred of these packs
released, or there was only 50 of them
[SPEAKER_00]: released, once they get it, they're more
likely to breed it and keep those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are more likely to say,
oh, I really wanted to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if everybody's already seen it at
everybody else's house, they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to go, yeah, I could get that
anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow that later, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, certainly when I see
people at the aficionado booth at Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup, I mean, people are treating these
things like they are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gods, because I mean, not only are
they paying, you know, serious money for
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but, you know, really, if,
you know, that's all you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you're popping each one
with intention and you're taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just, you know, I know when I have
got rare seeds, I just shower them with
[SPEAKER_01]: more love and care than I do if somebody
gives me, oh, here, this is my latest run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's 50 seeds of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I use the analogy of dogs,
you know, because I see a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of parallels, because, you know,
breeding dogs, breeding seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I always say, hey,
you know, like, and it's the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With dogs, I say, hey, go adopt a dog,
go get a dog at a shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, hey, go buy that $18 pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go try, yeah, plant those seeds that you
found in the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go plant those seeds that can't even it,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, just try them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know for a fact that if somebody
goes and they go get a dog out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard box in front of a store,
you know, they're going to be less likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to focus on that dog as much as if
somebody says, hey, here's a $12,000
[SPEAKER_00]: puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who buys a $12,000 puppy,
you think they're going to miss their
[SPEAKER_00]: shots and let them get parvo or they're
not going to cut their toenails or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to check their dog's ears and
teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I have, you know, I have dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one dog that's an expensive,
you know, highly bred, like show dog type
[SPEAKER_00]: pit bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a mutt that's a St. Bernard and
blue pit bull mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I treat them the same, but I also
treat crappy bag seeds that I find out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a bud that I think is a good bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, finding that bag seed, that's just
like somebody saying, hey, here is a pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't make very many, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I have like that understanding
that it could be anywhere, but I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of people who don't think
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand the value of telling
somebody, look, these are very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like when the black lime reserve
was the first thing that I put out
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly with a fish and auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, you know, I had a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have put out a couple thousand
packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that if I put out 300 packs,
that people would take them more seriously
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would be more likely to clone
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get a keeper, they'd be more
likely to make more seeds and they'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely to make crosses with the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like it when people do that stuff
with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just put out a cross and
have people go, oh yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the, like you said,
people, people act like they're gifts from
[SPEAKER_00]: the gods and like, you know, depending on
whether people believe in gods or a God or
[SPEAKER_00]: just the universal force or the spirit or
whatever people believe where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our life from, you know,
those seeds are a gift from that force,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that's a major thing that
like every type of life form that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these ones that help us as much as
cannabis, I mean, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing that's really as helpful
potentially to us as cannabis can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got something here that can
potentially, if you find the right plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could cure any disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be a matter of finding,
oh, okay, well look, this one produces
[SPEAKER_00]: this chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, once you get it down to
everybody only going, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just all grow OG or oh, we just only
grow sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just only grow cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets to a point where you go,
well, but what about all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these plants, they don't all
grow by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've adopted them into our cultures and
then we keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that means that if all of a
sudden we lose them, it's like we've
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted them and then we've abandoned
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we become responsible for the gene pool
because we've done these things to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've created all this really crazy
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while, then we go,
oh no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just all gets, it all gets left by
the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's like,
there's an aspect of things being sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at this point now, when I feel
like, okay, people understand that if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a breed and I say that it's really
valuable and it's really special and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth growing, people now more so than
when I first released stuff, people will
[SPEAKER_00]: believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like now I can put out a lot of
seeds and I can put out a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and people will understand where
I'm coming from in breeding that these
[SPEAKER_00]: things are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't necessarily have to say,
okay, well, this is so special like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so special because of that,
I can just say, look, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is worth having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, if you buy them, make more,
give them to your friends, take clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it around because it's part of what's
going on, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I say it's like a double
edged sword where you go, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's good to have it be limited,
but at the same time, you're going to miss
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these people who are out there who
are preservationists who are hoping that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get a pack and those guys
didn't get a pack and some guys who just
[SPEAKER_00]: grew them out real quick and sold the weed
without ever even smelling it because they
[SPEAKER_00]: heard it was a hot item.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys got some of the packs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be able to put them out so
that both those, I want to be the guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get the seeds and they just want
to, hey, I just want to grow a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and I'm going to make money and I'm
going to look cool and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get these cool strains, but I want them to
be able to also reach as many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preservationists as they can so that
people get their hands on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 50 years or a hundred years or a
thousand years from now, there's somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's got these things and they go,
hey, I don't know where these came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're really cool and they're
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep making more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like a service to the plant
because the plant is like, for me
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, there's nothing in life that's
ever done as much for me as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, amen to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to hear that you like the
idea that people are making crosses with
[SPEAKER_01]: your gear in order to preserve it in their
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed pack that I know that came up
here near me, my buddy planned the four
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses well in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had it all lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to try the original black
lime as you intended, but then also four
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the black lime is still in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still taste it, but you can also
get the variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of joy in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's wrap up with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of folks who are listening
today who aspire to be an elite breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: like you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of folks, they're getting their
start by just they've got two strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: they like, and then they cross them and
they've got F1s and they share them with
[SPEAKER_01]: their friends and they feel good about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they pick up a breeding book and
they get a little more serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've done it all now at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what advice do you have for folks
willing to put in the work who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow on this path behind you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you give them that can
kind of help them along their way?
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest advice would be go with what
you really, really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, as a commercial breeder,
I was talking to somebody and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, oh, I just take males and put them
on these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of like, oh, yeah, that's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, if you're going to
make stuff for Pete for others,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, what I said, I think is if
you want to please the crowd, you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: play the hits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a cool thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you are doing that,
you really want to go with what you really
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things that you really vibe with,
like, all right, this is something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy who he's like, I've seen
all the weed, I've seen all the kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, I like granddaddy perp or Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are still the thing that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into this kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into this diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just like perp, perp, perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if you're the guy who likes the
perp, then that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your very favorite thing,
then be the guy who makes the perp
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses, who makes the strains that are
based on perp and that have those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really, really tune into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really tune into what you're vibing with
because those good feelings that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting about something, those are what
are really telling you that that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how our intuition works and that's
how our brain and our, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is really, our whole energy is
really wired to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, if you want to breed,
breed the thing that you really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might, if you want to do it like
commercially, you might have to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about, okay, well, where is the place that
there's the overlap between these two,
[SPEAKER_00]: these two groups of traits here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else wants it to be stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get good concentrate
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a plant that's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a plant that's high yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so, you know, everybody wants those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then now with the things that you
really love, which might be like in my
[SPEAKER_00]: case, I love stuff that's floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stuff that's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stuff that's earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the smells that to me are like
classy, like to me, like loud is cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have to be loud for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like my little thing that I got
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gotta be whatever you are really,
really into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to tune into that and make that be
what you, what you're working towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because that's the only way you
can really do something well is to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be able to really be turned on by
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, all right, this is the thing that I
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I know about, you know,
like if you're going to be, if you like
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metal, don't play jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like, if you like tacos,
don't make pizza, you know, do whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, that thing that you really,
really like tune into that and do that to
[SPEAKER_00]: the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when you're going to wind
up having these things that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really cool, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally following your passion and
you'll, you'll, you'll never be bored in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gene, thank you so much for spending
