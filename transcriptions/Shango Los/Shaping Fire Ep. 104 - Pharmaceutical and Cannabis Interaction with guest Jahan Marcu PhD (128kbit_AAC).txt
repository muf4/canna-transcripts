[SPEAKER_00]: Patients always want exact answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I go to the doctor,
I too want specific answers to specific
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, and I rarely get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, when cannabis patients ask me
detailed questions, often the answers are
[SPEAKER_00]: also elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best medicine is individualized
medicine, and by definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: individualized medicine is going to be
somewhat unique to every person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, when it comes to cannabis,
if you identify the proper blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and start slow and low in the
dosage, a path to resolving the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: usually presents itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is safe for nearly everyone,
and humans have had thousands of years to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into a relationship with the plant and
learn it to be reliable and with few side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you add complex chemical
pharmaceuticals to the mix, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: things don't go as planned, and most
pharmaceuticals have only been around for
[SPEAKER_00]: a mere fraction of the time that cannabis
has been used by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, while a lay person can easily
understand the dosing dynamics for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that is entirely untrue for most
pharmaceuticals whose contents are
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally obscured and instructions
for use are shrouded in legally defendable
[SPEAKER_00]: double talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is enough to frustrate anyone just
trying to get well.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Jehan Marku.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marku is a molecular pharmacologist
with over 15 years of experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid research and a PhD focusing on
the pharmacology of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is Jehan a committed scientist,
but he goes way back too as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: activist and policy influencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marku is a founding partner at the
consulting firm of Marku and Aurora,
[SPEAKER_00]: which provides life science consulting to
the cannabis and psychedelic fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also chief scientific officer at
Physicians Research Center Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jehan also co-developed a biotech
application to predict drug-drug
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions between cannabis and commonly
prescribed pharmaceutical drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: co-authored one of the first product
safety studies on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marku co-authored American Herbal
Pharmacopias Cannabis Quality Control and
[SPEAKER_00]: Therapeutic Monographs and serves on
multiple expert government advisory and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade association committees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the founding editor in chief of the
American Journal of Endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine and is adjunct faculty at the
University of the Sciences in Philadelphia
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching the pharmacology of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has many research and media
publications and has appeared in Rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone, Science, Nature, JAMA, The
Washington Post, CNN and many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is host and producer of the How to
Launch an Industry podcast and is often
[SPEAKER_00]: called upon as a cannabis and synthetic
drug expert witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Marku has received numerous awards
including the Mahmoud El Soli Award for
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellence in Cannabis Chemistry and the
Billy Martin Research Achievement Award
[SPEAKER_00]: from the International Cannabinoid
Research Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: On today's episode of Shaping Fire,
we will talk about how to think through
[SPEAKER_00]: the dynamic challenges presented by
cannabis and pharmaceutical interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: and give you a roadmap for doing this
research for yourself or the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients you care for.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we will review red
flag pharmaceuticals and drug families
[SPEAKER_00]: that present especially high risk and how
the availability of new cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates has exacerbated these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third set, we look at the
differences between endocannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_00]: phytocannabinoid drug interaction,
discuss the state of drug-drug interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: research and we encourage everyone who
uses cannabis to visit budsinfo.com and
[SPEAKER_00]: complete a short questionnaire to help in
the research into this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Jahan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though you and I have
interacted over the years, this is episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 104 and your last visit to appear on
Shaping Fire was all the way back on
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like such a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it was the week of Christmas in
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like back in the before times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a lifetime ago for so many
things and projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the early days of Shaping
Fire when we focused a bit more on
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So episode 29 is a great one about
cannabis product manufacturing standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't cover the licensed market as
much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But folks, if you are in licensed cannabis
or in medical cannabis and in production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a really excellent show that has
remained evergreen over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to go back and check
out episode 29 if you haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, you know, the big update to
that, though, is I've gone from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, voluntary certification
assessments for regulatory compliance on
[SPEAKER_01]: all types of cannabis operations around
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, I actually got to visit
hemp facilities in China, Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've started to work with state
governments on determining compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: assessment criteria and updating
regulations driven by science from that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like you're like the
paleontologist, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to walk with a dinosaur like me in
the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's one way to put it,
except you're still so young, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope so, because I think you're
younger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're here to talk and focus on
the interplay between cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals that cannabis patients may
be taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both want to be clear right off the
bat that we are not giving you medical
[SPEAKER_00]: advice today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no way of knowing your actual
whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal today is to flesh out some of
the intricacies of this topic and help you
[SPEAKER_00]: gain some perspective so you can figure
out effective individualized medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself or the people that you care for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jehan, the idea that any one of so many
phyto cannabinoids interacting with any
[SPEAKER_00]: one of thousands of prescription drugs
that they could have an unintended side
[SPEAKER_00]: effect seems like a pretty realistic thing
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for years in the medical cannabis
community, no one wanted to admit that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was possible, including me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it was simply because there were
so little research into it or and we just
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it could also just be that we're
all really protective of our favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we know that these interactions
actually do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: As as more and more people use cannabis
and we're able to collect more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we actually seeing more reports of
interactions nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential for drug drug interactions,
regardless of the substance, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has compounds that interact with
receptors and are metabolized by our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Else it wouldn't have all these,
you know, wonderful therapeutic benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: that we hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but drug drug interactions or DDIs are
are increasing generally across the board,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just for cannabinoids or cannabis,
but it is the primary cause of adverse
[SPEAKER_01]: drug reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's something that creates over
half a billion dollars of estimated burden
[SPEAKER_01]: on our health care system annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of efforts to avoid
these drug drug interactions, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, regulatory agencies like the FDA
usually mandate this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know a lot about them for some
stuff for like Marinol, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: approved, you know, a decade or so before
we even knew there were cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors, as well as for Epidiolex or
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these have been explored.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're dealing with now is,
you know, we live in a really lucky time
[SPEAKER_01]: and in a really lucky place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to this in the United
States, we have the FDA and I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: people like to criticize the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's that's one of the great
things about being alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to criticize things, but it's also
the best drug regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's so good that most of us
simply throw away the insert on any
[SPEAKER_01]: medication we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like as this long fold out map of
potential issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, just throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do live in a time where we buy a
loaf of bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy a bottle of aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get our prescription medications and we
just assume that if it's on a shelf,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's safe and the risks, you know,
are known or they wouldn't or wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, there's interesting
things are happening with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds due to a strong patient and
consumer demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis based products don't follow the
traditional standard drug development
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline that we hold pharmaceutical drugs
like, you know, antidepressants or other
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs to they just, you know, you package
and label them at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a lack of understanding or
appreciation of the potential drug drug
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a lot of these occur from,
you know, oral administration of multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: substances, sort of the more drugs that
you use, the more pharmaceutical drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more medicines you take, the higher
your chance of interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is not, you know,
we have to kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a passionate advocate of product
safety, particularly for medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patients for almost two decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I remember a time when the
plant products weren't even tested before
[SPEAKER_01]: giving to people who had compromised
immune systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember arguing with operators to put
voluntarily put expiration dates and
[SPEAKER_01]: people saying things like, well,
cookies don't go bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we, we see drug, drug
interactions all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about them all the time,
but we don't know that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are for our benefit and some
of them can increase risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you an example of a
conversation I had 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just a, just a little researcher at
the time, an undergraduate and I
[SPEAKER_01]: approached a cannabis operation and
started talking them up about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should carry CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like going to be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people had started small circles of
talk about, and they asked me what it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Oh, well, it, it actually
blocks the intoxicating effects of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh my God, that sounds
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will ever want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD and THC is a form of a drug,
drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite what we're talking about,
but it can be one that may not be ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think that when we talk
about drug, drug interactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: we talk about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about, Oh, this variety of
cannabis has this mixture of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it's has these indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an array that can be present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we always have to keep in mind
that we are familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like saying, I like to talk
about, you know, baseball statistics,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't like math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, clearly you do like math because
you're analyzing averages and percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we do have the fundamentals of
this, I think in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not really talking about,
I think anything new today that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you probably haven't discussed
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do drugs interact together to produce
an effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How a little bit, um, because the
different mechanisms, um, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important for people to wrap their heads
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the first interaction that I was
aware of was years ago learning that CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: can increase the potency of some seizure
medications, meaning that the seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: patients taking CBD could sometimes take
less of that seizure medication and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, let's dissect that idea
because the CBD could be causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure medication to be more potent for
many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being perhaps that the CBD and the
seizure medication are doing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and working side by side instead of
actually on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or secondly, CBD could be acting in a way
that the seizure medication has,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets more resources or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different mechanisms for
why that could be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I know that you have
studied in detail these different
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms of drug, drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really appreciate if you would tease
them apart and explain a few of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, take your time and give us,
give us like three or four so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really grok the different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about mechanisms,
um, you know, we can, I like to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about them in three ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is cannabinoids as victim,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the mechanism is that the levels of
the cannabinoid is changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a drug and it makes the,
you take you and you take it with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it drug X, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take it with a THC product and
suddenly you're feeling way more sedated
[SPEAKER_01]: or have way higher munchies side effect or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick your side effect for your conceptual
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's increased because the
cannabinoid levels are changed by another
[SPEAKER_01]: drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabinoid is a victim where it's
levels in your body are changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cannabinoids can also be
perpetrators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can cause changes in the levels of
another drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so in this case, you know,
they might be increasing or decreasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of, like you said, like an
anti-epileptic medication or a pain
[SPEAKER_01]: medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this information is well
understood, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be leveraged to improve,
uh, healthcare outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're like, Oh, there's a
drug, drug interaction between
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and opioids, you can take
less opioids and get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thank goodness we knew about those
interactions so that we could take steps
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that a benefit instead of an
increased risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there also are, so we've talked about
cannabinoids as victims, cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetrators, and there are also
pharmacodynamic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the first five syllable
word we've used so far, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacodynamic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this means is that both drugs
have overlapping effects and our concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: of victim and perpetrator don't apply
here, but you know, one thing is like if
[SPEAKER_01]: we take a research on THC and baclofen
individually at doses given to people and
[SPEAKER_01]: studies is a little bit of sedation,
not too much to write home about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you put them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like sedation coming from that
drug sedation, coming from the other drug
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sedation plus sedation equals a lot of
sedation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that could be an unwanted side
effect and adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so as we, continue with this
victim and perpetrator analogy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you mentioned cannabidiol CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a great example because,
you know, here we have a drug that is
[SPEAKER_01]: given to pediatric patients in large
amounts who are also taking other
[SPEAKER_01]: medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the, you know, I think even several
years ago, starting, I think Davinsky
[SPEAKER_01]: published a paper in 2018 and those of you
listening, can email me, uh, message me on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything I mentioned, you're like,
I want that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me that link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, feel free to reach out, but you know,
they show that high doses of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly increased levels of NAR
clobazam, um, which is an active
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite of clobazam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what you're saying is you
have a baseline amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call the baseline zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an or normal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so when you take it with,
um, CBD, um, you can start to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: see that, uh, the amounts of clobazam and
the ratio of clobazam to nor clobazam,
[SPEAKER_01]: the metabolite and the, the, the,
the parent compound just go a little
[SPEAKER_01]: haywire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start to see those levels change if
almost completely different than without
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking, um, you know, the,
the, we're seeing, you know, 150,
[SPEAKER_01]: 200, 350% above baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, uh, you know, those bars on the
graph look like skyscrapers of New York
[SPEAKER_01]: city, which is a signal that we need to
pay more attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be an example of a
cannabinoid as a perpetrator of a drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so how is this happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be saying, well, we have a lot
of things in our bodies that like to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we're, we're hardwired to,
uh, consume things, have them hit little
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins, also known as receptors
throughout our body and send along little
[SPEAKER_01]: messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, however, we have to have a system
that gets rid of the drugs after they've
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of sent their message to the brain,
to the body and had their effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have these drug metabolizing
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are the garbage trucks of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just like, they like chewing up drugs
and helping us pee them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the enzymes are responsible for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I say enzymes, I say proteins,
I say receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all things that our body makes
from our DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have, we have DNA codes,
amino acids that form these proteins and
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins can do a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these sip P, uh, see white P four 50,
we call them sips, uh, for short,
[SPEAKER_01]: for short, for cytochrome P four 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are many different, different
forms and, um, you know, there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we inherit different ones
from our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this next point is important
because with the advent of gene testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can find out some information about
how you might, uh, metabolize drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there are people who are slow
metabolizers, like really poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a drug stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that are intermediate
metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people who are extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are people who are ultra
rapid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that if you're an ultra
rapid metabolizer, you can take a drug and
[SPEAKER_01]: you may not even feel, or you may feel
just the faintest of effects for it before
[SPEAKER_01]: it's metabolized and excreted from your
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some really wild examples of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you know, for example,
um, there is an association with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, cause people who, who suffer from a
genetically from sickle cell disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they have some genes, uh, in majority
of the population that are conserved and
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them are ultra rapid metabolizers
of opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frequently people with sickle cell
disease get prescribed the maximal allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of opioids, which has been steadily
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decreasing over time, but they tend to be
ultra rapid metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas most average people would
probably fall in the intermediate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mid range of drug metabolizing,
um, and a little opioid goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are populations that would rapidly
just, and wouldn't feel an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked really weird on someone's
chart had a doctor like, wow, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking a lot of opioids, but unless you
knew the genetic component and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs that were taking it may not make a
lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one is, uh, to know thyself,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you using kind of all available
tools to understand, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a baseline, how do I, what,
how do I even metabolize drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I the type of person who can drink
coffee all day long and go to sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm a rapid metabolizer or we'll
just smelling a cup of coffee,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep me up for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these might be things you can
playfully tease out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason I want to mention that,
cause that is a factor, um, with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there are people who have mutations,
uh, polymorphisms, uh, a single little
[SPEAKER_01]: change, um, can cause people to be,
you know, much more, uh, say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can change the amount of THC that's
even in their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a slow metabolizer of THC,
you'll have more THC floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and much like someone floating around
with nothing to do, they might get into
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is increases the, the chances
of a drug, drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, you could have, be a slow
metabolizer and realize that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be careful about the timing and
method of ingestion because, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to stick around for longer
than the average person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could get, you know, depending on
how well you metabolize things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could have threefold higher levels
floating around, um, which I have to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if you do are a rapid or ultra rapid
metabolizer, you'll probably have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of passing a blood test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were ever pulled over for a
cannabis related DUI, you just better hope
[SPEAKER_01]: and pray you're a rapid metabolizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's based on thresholds for the amount
in your system, uh, just to give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of some real world implications
for this information, powerful information
[SPEAKER_01]: is available for you to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This I think is the point I'm making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talked about CBD and clobazam
and how that's an interaction where CBD is
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibiting a sip that prevents the
metabolism of this class of
[SPEAKER_01]: benzodiazepine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, not a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, uh, you know, we have these
sips, these enzymes, and there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of them and they do different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, they metabolize different
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we think about you know,
cannabinoids as victims, um, there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, different steps and they have fun
little names like sip three, a four or sip
[SPEAKER_01]: to see nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you're probably wondering,
those are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad scientists named them that way
because it's totally easy to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, you know, um, so sip three,
a four, um, can be inhibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be activated, uh, by different
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so clorithromycin, ketoglutamine,
clorizol, there's other protease
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibitors that people take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take those drugs,
you're, you're inhibiting some sips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they like to block those proteins
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take a cannabinoid,
you could have two to four times the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of THC or CBD in your bloodstream,
in your plasma, uh, relative to just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, taking the cannabinoid alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, again, these could be drugs
that have nothing to do with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: like clorithromycin or again, keto
coleslaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's a paper I think published
in 2013, you know, 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: they identified this reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we see is that you have these
drug metabolizing enzymes that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: either in, can be largely inhibited by a
drug that then affects another drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC needs sip three, a four to be
metabolized and processed by the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: You inhibit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays around longer, um, which could
have unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it all comes down to how we use
the information, um, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that there's again,
um, you know, a lot of this information is
[SPEAKER_01]: extrapolated from drug metabolism studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not, there's not a lot of
clinical work where people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to study drug, drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the, it's all sort of,
it's all sort of teased out from studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of this stuff has been put
together from almost like detective like
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, you know, there are some
clinically significant ones and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CBD, um, you know, with clobazam
warfarin, uh, tacro myas and methadone
[SPEAKER_01]: have all been, um, implicated in having a
potential significant drug, stroke
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that they're thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nuance there is that it also depends a
little bit on your genetic makeup and a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, on paper, these things have a
clinically significant, uh, interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and THC does share some of those
similar concerns with, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: TB CBD and THC both represent an issue
with warfare and potentially as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're seeing now exactly how
complex this has become because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of us, we're just kind of
thinking in this singular way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are interacting with
pharmaceuticals and generally we think of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as having a bad effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, we're getting a better
idea now that we can have cannabis acting
[SPEAKER_00]: on the pharmaceutical and then we can have
the pharmaceutical perhaps acting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and they can also be going in the
different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be inhibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could be inhibiting the other,
or they could also have additive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that's going in two directions and
then, and then, and then there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: two directions because the additive or
inhibitive effects could actually end up
[SPEAKER_00]: being desirous or they could be something
that we don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly now we see this like
multi-dimensional, um, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: interplay between these drug-drug
interactions and like our definitions kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of start to float away because,
because some of the interactions for one
[SPEAKER_00]: patient are going to be negative and,
but for a different patient, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be desirous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you've done a really good
job at illustrating how, how we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to look at, you know, individual
patients and not make big grandiose rules
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to try to apply to
everybody, all drugs or all types of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I like this encouragement for
us to, you know, dig into our genetics as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, especially if we're trying
to tease out some kind of drug-drug
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction problem we think we have,
um, uh, and, and we want to get specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like this idea of this perpetrator
and victim idea where, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got, you've got one compound that
is receiving the action and the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, is placing the action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk a little bit about the
cannabinoids that are already in our body,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like up till now, we've been talking
about adding phyto cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: so cannabinoids from plants, um,
to the mix, but we know that we already
[SPEAKER_00]: have endogenous cannabinoids in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and usually when we are taking
additional phyto cannabinoids from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant to supplement the
endocannabinoids that our body creates,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, that's, that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious, um, do we see any,
uh, or, or significant interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: between these endocannabinoids that
somebody who doesn't even use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: will have in them and these
pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we certainly can talk about
some of the things that will make you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize you have an endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about the endocannabinoid
system, it's, it's again, it's not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: nanomide and two AG and PEA and OEA and
all the amino acid conjugated
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids and you know,
the, we could definitely delve into the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular psychiatry of all those
compounds, but we have to remember that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these endocannabinoids are made on
demand and they are metabolized quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reason that's important is because you
know, we, we, we want to, we want to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on a nanomide and two AG, but we also have
to focus on them being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just look at the bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to look at the gun that's firing
the bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this sense, um, the analogy isn't
perfect, but when we think about pho,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the, as in, you know,
I like to think far out research,
[SPEAKER_01]: far research, but pho is an enzyme that,
you know, chews up the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's, it's the, you know,
the endocannabinoid dump truck,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, they are made quickly by our body on
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most signaling molecules are made
and stored and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, endocannabinoids are made on demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one interaction with the
endocannabinoid system, but I think most
[SPEAKER_01]: people have experienced, um, I will
describe in a moment, there's actually an
[SPEAKER_01]: over the counter medication that anyone
can buy that will interact with your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I'm gonna let you think about
it for a minute listener and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: go, but I just want to tell you about this
case report real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so imagine you, uh, had a history of
painless injuries in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You accidentally cut your finger and
everyone's like, Oh my gosh, did that
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, eh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stub your toe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morphine opioids don't really relieve your
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some minor surgery, uh,
from experiencing life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you're like, I don't need
pay medication and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you, people around you and even use
like, wow, I have this high threshold for
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how could the endocannabinoid system
explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not really getting an effect
from opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't even need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's, um, and this is from a
story that was laid out in a case report
[SPEAKER_01]: about a, a micro deletion in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in a FAA gene, the gene that
tells our bodies how to make this enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: that breaks down the endocannabinoids and
that without the dump truck, the trash
[SPEAKER_01]: just piles up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get a lot of anandamide and,
um, you know, decreases in pain
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this actually really happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mutant walks among us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 66 year old female had a history
of not requiring any pain medication,
[SPEAKER_01]: a history of painless injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and why, why do I say, why does this
relate to an over the counter
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid drug?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a little tongue in cheek,
but paracetamol or as some of us call it
[SPEAKER_01]: Tylenol, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, requires thought to exert its pain
relieving properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so a, uh, basically Alex Macrianas
who's at Northeastern university was an
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor on my thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it was also, you know,
many of my colleagues like Dr. Josh
[SPEAKER_01]: Hartsell and others, um, worked with him
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he discovered, um, a drug and it turns
out that it's, um, it's related to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically, um, it without,
when you take Tylenol, it is metabolized
[SPEAKER_01]: into a FAA inhibitor, which temporarily
increases the amount of endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you, uh, created, uh,
what they did in an experimental model,
[SPEAKER_01]: a permanent FAA inhibitor drug,
which irreversibly binds FAA, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: paracetamol or Tylenol had no effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no endocannabinoid system, no Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this is, again, this is a fun
example, an extreme example for us to play
[SPEAKER_01]: with these concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, um, I'm taking Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways it works is by inhibiting
this enzyme that allows my
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids to flourish and be
produced in higher than normal
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does other things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and so I think like there's one
example of endocannabinoid interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so the next time you go to a
grocery store, you know, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there's an endocannabinoid
medicine right there on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but obviously, you know, the
endocannabinoids are slightly different in
[SPEAKER_01]: their activity than THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They share a lot of interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think there are other things we
can think about, you know, cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously interact with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the ways that we can
think about it, um, is it, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cannabinoids can, you know,
inhibit or enhance certain activities of
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if we have, you know,
uh, TBD in there and it's modulating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid receptors to make them more
difficult to be activated, it's actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a negative allosteric modulator of
CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what does that do to your
natural anandamide signaling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD can definitely influence that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think we can think about other
aspects, um, there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, I wish I had like a
virtual whiteboard to start drawing out
[SPEAKER_01]: circles and charts, but let me try to sum
it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, CBD, is a great one to talk
about because it does a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very promiscuous, uh, molecule,
but it, it increases anandamide levels
[SPEAKER_01]: because CBD does have a little bit of pha
inhibitor activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it increases anandamide levels that
stimulates a bunch of other channels,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, and receptors like trip V1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're a vanilloid receptors,
trip V1, something you, you, you stimulate
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat spicy food, um, it's,
it's a capsaicin.
[SPEAKER_01]: From chili peppers stimulates it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you could take,
uh, you know, CBD increases anandamide
[SPEAKER_01]: levels or you're in, or if you just have
naturally high anandamide levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: this will counteract or antagonize,
uh, the effect of potentially of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, of CB1 receptors on glutamatergic
neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can, um, you know, one thing
that THC does is it slows brain activity a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by brain activity,
it doesn't like make your brain dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's one of the reasons it has a
benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that people talk about cytotoxicity,
excessively active neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a seizure or traumatic injury,
your neurons might be firing like crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: and firing till they kill themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like release, release, release,
stimulate, stimulate, stimulate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, red alert, red alert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you can decrease that
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why one of the reasons it makes it
hard to remember stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it also makes it, you know,
makes it harder to receive a pain signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what happens is, uh, just simply
put THC hits a receptor decreases in
[SPEAKER_01]: glutamate release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, uh, you can also enhance
glutamate release by stimulating trip
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could have this sort of give
and take these forces going in different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions, um, to impact it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that was a little bit of a heady
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but I mean, there's lots of
examples, um, like this, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that's probably the one we need for
now though, um, uh, because you're right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, it is incredibly complex and we're
certainly not going to be able to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: them all, but, um, in, in one episode,
but you made the point very clearly that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to not go into this with
assumptions that a, we know what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen based on science that might be
outmoded and that individuals and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really show the importance of
individualized medicine and that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in a way we're kind of like
already swimming in all of these drug
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that, that, you know,
we're taking from over the, or over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter drugs plus any pharmaceuticals
that were being offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, you know, you add to it,
maybe some cannabinoids and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe somebody is also micro
dosing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and suddenly now there's this,
like the, this soup of, of different drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: drug interactions going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's no surprise that,
that there would be some, some sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you jump on that, cause I can
almost feel you going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take our first short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire and my
guest today's molecular pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jayan Marku, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the award
winning cannabis seeds that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical breeding program of Seth and
Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the revolution seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including Sour Diesel, Triangle Kush,
Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs, Skittles and
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one THC to THCV and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_00]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis seed market is filled with
big name and hype breeders fighting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally you discover a breeder
who is breeding because it is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing they care to do and they would be
doing it even if they never made a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my friend, Craig Hartzah,
who makes seeds as magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig comes from five generations of
farmers and is earning his master's degree
[SPEAKER_00]: in horticulture right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing cannabis for 15 years
and been breeding for nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't sold many seeds because he
really isn't a sales guy, but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: personally been growing his seeds for
years and I know I can always rely on his
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to germinate, thrive and smell and
taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested to Craig that he should
probably sell some seeds and asked if he
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough stockpiled to bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to my shock, he was sitting on five
full menus in cold storage that he
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the last two years and hadn't
even tried to sell any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was simply too busy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we his friends convinced him to make
his damn seeds available to the people and
[SPEAKER_00]: now they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time anywhere you can now
buy magnetic genetic seeds at Neptune Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank and on strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neptune Seed Bank has just picked up
magnetic genetics for a trial to gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: your interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are carrying three strains from his
Mean Mug, Prominence and Turpinado menus
[SPEAKER_00]: which are exclusive to Neptune.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way to score his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick up those menus plus his
hillbilly skunk and candy breath crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and more on his profile page on strainly
.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want very affordable seeds that are
exceptional quality with rare turpinado
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles from a good guy, go to
Neptuneseedbank.com or strainly.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is fun to buy the hype thing
from the brand you admire, but when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to buy the strain you'll love from
an obscure mad scientist, you're ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magneticgenetics.org and on Instagram,
magnetic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_00]: other psychedelics and it's a very strange
time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014 and as the
[SPEAKER_00]: market has diversified into psilocybin and
other plant medicines, Green Light has
[SPEAKER_00]: been right there evolving with their
diverse clients to provide legal expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high level of legal acumen,
creative strategy and precision that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_00]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner or simply because you wanna stay
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their work
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Green Light Law Group today and

[SPEAKER_00]: offer your industry leading companies in
cannabis or psychedelics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Green Light Law Group at

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and my guest
today is molecular pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jehan Marku, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Jehan, during the first set,
you were very clear that we are seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: more of these pharmaceutical and cannabis
or cannabinoid interactions for two big
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being there's more people using
cannabis and then two, there's more people
[SPEAKER_00]: researching it and collecting the data on
this stuff, which is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to think that not only is
there just more people though using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, cannabis itself has expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're suddenly accessing all these new
cannabinoids that we are experiencing in
[SPEAKER_00]: higher amounts than they would have in
land races and we're also got new ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis like dabbing where you're
suddenly getting all these terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids at one time and it's not
uncommon for people to keel over after a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more than we as humans
ever interacted with when we were walking
[SPEAKER_00]: the plains and mountains and pulling
cannabis plants out and getting the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of land races they had 10,000 years ago or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to what effect these new methods and
new ranges of cannabinoids are having on
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction with pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our ancestors used to just eat
cannabis and clear some land and there'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be more cannabis growing in fresh cut
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have access to chemicals like
butane and shoved it in a tube and extract
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they would do manual extractions
and so I think it's always important to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that concentrating cannabis has
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arab merchants used to trade it up and
down the coast of Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the earliest reports about
cannabis use are these black hashish bars
[SPEAKER_01]: with guys riding basically naked in
horseback into villages to trade these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the composition of the matter has
changed greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This always reminds me of a mantra phrase
or principle from my colleague Teresa
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon who's an epidemiologist and we've
done a lot of database mining,
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA database, adverse events databases,
collection tools like the budsinfo.com
[SPEAKER_01]: thing where we collect experiential data
and adverse events from cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of a student project but she
says this thing, it seems like every week
[SPEAKER_01]: at every meeting she says, efficacy gets
it on the market, safety keeps it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we've all been in the
cannabis industry more than two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years, we can all probably think of
one or two products that hit the market
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to really pause and think
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to think about a little bit about
our commitments here when we put these
[SPEAKER_01]: products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to get back to your
question as I've meandered off the path a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit but it just made me think about
a lot of these products are concentrating
[SPEAKER_01]: things beyond what our ancestors would
have encountered in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBL and all these other cannabinoids I
mean they've never been consumed in large
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unprecedented in our time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean people even 20 years ago weren't
really consuming huge amounts of purified
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the distribution of cannabinoids and
products in concentrated products from
[SPEAKER_01]: Morocco over the centuries not nearly
compare to the purity and refinement of
[SPEAKER_01]: these dabs, waxes, shatters, whatever you
want to call it, the stuff that looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: earwax and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no question those are very
efficient products to deliver cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is unclear is what is the trade off?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the risk benefits to using that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you need to use as much as you're
using or could you use less?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that those are questions we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think about, there's this old question,
the dose makes the poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is poisonous, everything is
poisonous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a matter of dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At ambient air levels terpenes are
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk into a grocery store and they've
got that produce section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells great to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool breeze, light smell of chlorophyll
and maybe they have some flowers going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you concentrate some of those
products, you'll find them as cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limonene is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious and refreshing and
uplifting and lemonade and even on a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis product has been reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you concentrate it, it makes a
great cleaning agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can strip a sticker off a metal wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily something you want to
inhale into your lungs is a pure
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also depends again, there are
terpenes that you shouldn't even use in a
[SPEAKER_01]: diffuser if you have a small pet like a
cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, I think we always have to
think about that some of these compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: do carry risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like they're safe at any level
without risk at any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm really talking about here is
there are moments where we should pause
[SPEAKER_01]: and think there are red lights,
there are yellow lights, there's proceed
[SPEAKER_01]: with normal precautions, there's proceed
with extra precautions and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: consider alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're really lucky that THC,
CBD, low toxicity, great therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: index.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're both FDA approved in one
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THC appears in three scheduling cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's below a certain amount,
it's been legalized in the form of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hemp chocolates can have more THC
in them than a THC product you buy at a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly they've, through regulation and
stuff like that and even this public
[SPEAKER_01]: health experiment we have going on,
we found that, hey, there are certain
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that are lower risk than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC, CBD, again, just because they're
relatively safe doesn't mean that every
[SPEAKER_01]: single thing on the plant is relatively
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have to be, it's good to be
optimistic, but also to have skepticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skepticism is our friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, THC, CBD, we know about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know about their acidic components a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do we know about the other 100 or
so compounds that can be found on it in
[SPEAKER_01]: small amounts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of things in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most potent things in nature are often
there in the smallest amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at marine biology like
nematodes and other stuff like that for
[SPEAKER_01]: documentaries, they have really potent
compounds for defense in them and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: usually small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think about things like THCP and
these other things that are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: ooh, a hundred times more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, what does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it mean it's just going to be more
pleasurable or does it mean you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be catatonic for three or four days if
you consume a large amount of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and these stories are not often
popularized for a number of reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are stories, you know,
back in the, you know, back in the decades
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, it was very common for
pharmacologists who developed drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something they phased out when I
was a graduate student, so no fun for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the most common things was the
pharmacologist to take it to see if it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually ended with a student being
doubled over a sink vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that was what people would
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have to, there are lots of
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to conferences and you ask
around, oh, has anyone ever taken this
[SPEAKER_01]: compound that's a hundred to a thousand
times more potent than THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone may tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that guy was catatonic for five days
and on his floor of his kitchen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's not to say that are,
and I'm not saying that any compounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: that exist on the market that we know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm just wanting to get the
idea that, you know, small changes to a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, small differences can have
dramatic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ethanol, we like to drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Methanol can make us go blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's a very subtle difference in
their chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tie a couple of things that you
said together for the caregivers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening because, you know, as,
as, you know, everybody who listens to the
[SPEAKER_00]: show knows that like, I'm, I'm very
patient centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I myself have not a healthcare
professional because of the role I play in
[SPEAKER_00]: the community, I talk to a lot of patients
and have, have heard, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal stories and like, you know,
over a thousand patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're a caregiver based on what
Jehan just said, these are the couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: the takeaways that, that I would offer,
which would be number one, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've had a, a, just because you're
working with a patient or you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient who has always used cannabis and,
and has used a particular pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take out a possibility that the
cannabis and the pharmaceutical could be
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting in a new way now, because the
cannabis that is available to you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient has now changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're no longer just you know,
you know, smoking your home grow and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and rolling up joints and,
and using that for your pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe now you are dabbing and maybe you
are taking edibles with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 milligrams of THC, or maybe you are
you're dabbing and you are supplementing
[SPEAKER_00]: with straight terpenes, which I see people
do, which just like is so dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's, there's no scientific
history of us, of us dabbing straight
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, you know, I'm not saying don't
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, um, you know, don't amend
with terpenes in your edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is, is you as a patient or
as a caregiver, um, uh, it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a helpful perspective to realize
that as cannabis changes and in,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's not the same cannabis that we had
30 years ago, that the patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with cannabinoids and the
pharmaceutical models might change as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so moving on from, from that to the
next area, uh, Jehan, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk just briefly about
isolate versus whole plant, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, medicines because, you know,
uh, I, I've warmed up to isolates a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I, I've never really had all that
much good to say about isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of, of whole plant,
um, cannabis preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I've had to be more open to
isolate as, as the breeding for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, specific, uh, you know, blends of
cannabinoids and plants is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going slower than we want it to go to be
able to relieve the suffering of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of so many patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, before, before CBD was
available everywhere, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we eventually figured out that,
okay, if, if you've got a THC type one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but you don't have access to CBD,
all right, spiking it with some CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate in the presence of the rest of the
cannabinoids in the, in the whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, that's probably a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, you know, uh,
Dr. Agarwal and, and Dr. Russo have all
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the show and have said,
you know, that's, that sounds like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so more of us are using isolate,
um, here and there to, to spike our
[SPEAKER_00]: different preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, you've got
pharmaceutical companies that are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, isolate and hand chosen terpenes
to make, um, you know, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the early endocannabinoid drugs like,
uh, like Epidiolex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, you know, when I read
the, when I read the descriptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it, it, it smacks of like kind
of Frankenstein's monster to me a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would much rather have a plant that
is a two to one CBD to THC with a proper
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile and, and have it in the
resin from the plant and then just use the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's, there's thousands of
years of good relationship between us and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that I think is less effective
when we, when we tear it all down and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it into a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, um, we have, we're going
into this direction and it's certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people and that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've, I've had to soften my opinionated
on this, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so this is all circling around to this
question is that when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with other pharmaceuticals,
are there any things that we should,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as cannabis patients or as caregivers
be aware of how isolates might interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with pharmaceuticals differently than how
whole plant preparations like rosins and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff might interact with pharmaceuticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that it's a question that,
um, you, the answer is yes and no,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to give a truly academic
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, spiking adulterating or,
or, you know, can be one in the same term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I might use them interchangeably as
I just kind of speak off the cuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, mixing Let's start with
ancient times, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so changing the composition of
something you're consuming for the
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes of a psychoactive effect is,
it's not a new practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would, uh, I, I would give you very
poor odds against the idea that our
[SPEAKER_01]: ancestors mixed lots of plant products
together and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm willing to bet that things like
lavender or chamomile and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: calamus root, I think even some of these
have been documented were smoked and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably mixed with cannabis, not all too
different in concept from spiking with
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, adding a foreign compound to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, indeed, like sad of X that's like what
you're describing sounds like how sad of X
[SPEAKER_01]: is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the, the oral mucosal,
the tincture that's sprayed under the
[SPEAKER_01]: tongue that's licensed in over 30
countries, but not in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is two cannabis varieties
extracted by CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turned in an oil and mixed together to get
this nice ratio of a one to one THC to
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a proven strategy or tactic,
um, in preparing medicine and making
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anytime you are increasing the dose or
your exposure, you're introducing new
[SPEAKER_01]: complications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cannabinoids are waxy and sticky
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, if you're really
consuming a lot of the stuff, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can stick to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can stick to your teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can start to stick to your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some people who, um,
have way, and I'm talking extreme,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lasagna tray of dab sort of thing
just to be, you know, um, a little silly
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but they're, they're, they're
consuming a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can coat airways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can collect on materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Material and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that, that may be a bad time for
some folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so again, but that's not going to
happen with moderate or low use of these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, typically you can't,
you know, um, what's sold in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use stores, um, regulated adult use
dispensaries isn't really not enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to induce some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, chronic consumption
of concentrated products, can introduce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, um, let's, let's use an
analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's talk like beer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus, um, you know, vodka, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer, few percent alcohol, maybe 8%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty potent beer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, vodka, they don't even use
percents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use proofs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it could be quite,
uh, it could be quite a lot more potent by
[SPEAKER_01]: an order of magnitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even wine, wine can be, you know,
upwards of 20% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, twice as much that's,
uh, than a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're talking 40 to 60% by
weight alcohol, I mean, you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: adding a zero onto the percentage of a
beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beer is 5% and you have a alcoholic
beverage that's above 50% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an order of magnitude more ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're drinking, a beer,
you know, you have all these other things
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, you got some, some flavor
compounds, you know, a nice big double
[SPEAKER_01]: hopped IPA, you know, they just,
they smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into plants, um, you can,
you can smell the terpenes from the hops
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, there are other compounds in
there that give it flavor and body and
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a bit dilute though,
the alcohol in that mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're drinking like liquid bread
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at like a Guinness
for example, um, or some of those more
[SPEAKER_01]: heavier beers, unfiltered beers,
there's other components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what is the difference between a beer
and vodka?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just, you know, we can describe it
in terms of smell and taste, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: also describe it in terms of calories and
what else is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it better to drink the ethanol in a
liquid bread preparation or is it better
[SPEAKER_01]: to drink it in a pure form?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to use something that perhaps
people who don't use dabs or extracts or
[SPEAKER_01]: are considering it to give them,
you know, an analogy to think about when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think the idea of adding a compound
to mitigate the side effects, like putting
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD in a product to decrease the potential
adverse effects of someone who's sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'd love to see, I think more,
more of that available to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this form of compound pharmacy,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I think, uh, you know,
it seems like, you know, these extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: have a utility, I think, especially in
people with severe conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer, chemotherapy, um, extremely
difficult to treat neurodegenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we look at CBD,
even, um, you know, the average person,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, buys a boutique CBD product and
might have five milligrams in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, I feel so relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if you look at what's being used
in the clinic, we're talking hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of CBD for an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we can't really say, oh,
it's bad and this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's all a bit of a spectrum in
terms of the context of use and why you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, the more you take of
something, the more you have, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I use the analogy of the guy
walking around town with nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: might just get into trouble if they walk
down the wrong alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think about that a little bit
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, if you're hanging out,
playing in the street, cause you got
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to do, it's all fine till the
wrong car comes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, um, there are things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using a lot of cannabinoids
and suddenly you get a new prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: medication, um, you know, that might
present some complications.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, you know, that they have that
advice, you know, go low, start low and go
[SPEAKER_01]: slow, take it at night when you're using
new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the sort of give you like,
I'm going to use it in a safe place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use a small amount and I'm
going to write down what happened and how
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt just so I can start to track
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause no one's really, you know,
I don't think either one of us are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we're not telling people not
to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're think we're just giving them pause
to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because other people are doing it
doesn't mean that it's necessarily right
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, you know, uh, make, make informed
choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I think about, you know,
I, uh, I don't golf that often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I do it's, it's pretty
terrible, but, um, you know, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing for the cannabis is the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the things I like in golf are putting,
the slow putts, the short distance things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hitting, whacking the ball as
hard as you can with as much force as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can to go as far as you can, you know,
taking heroic doses of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, uh, you see, you might
spend a lot of time wondering just where
[SPEAKER_01]: that ball is versus, you know,
putting you got a green, there's a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still a lot of fun there and a
challenge there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, it's, it's different
strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I would really just give people
pause about that because you want to take
[SPEAKER_01]: a holistic approach with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you, when it comes to
patients, you know, especially avoiding
[SPEAKER_01]: drug, drug interactions, there might be a
real strategy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you prefer edibles, but the edibles
stick around so long because they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're swallowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go through GI tract and they go to
the liver just like a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, inhalation, it avoids that first
round eventually does get metabolized,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it avoids that first round pass
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're consuming, uh, let's call it
healthy, normal cannabis, not,
[SPEAKER_01]: not special cannabis, not, um,
you know, cannabis dipped in hash oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: not dabs, not cannabis with spiked with
other cannabinoids, but just good old
[SPEAKER_01]: fashioned, uh, plant material,
you know, and you're inhaling that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you might be able to decrease
your chances as a strategy, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: conceptually, you know, the amount of
administration matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swallowing things makes everything
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a reason why Sativex,
and if you haven't looked into an
[SPEAKER_01]: abixamols or tinctures, I think this is an
area worthy of further development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, taking a product that can be applied
under the tongue or in the cheek and
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb buccaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't swallow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't, don't even visualize
yourself swallowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't want any placebo effects on
this podcast, but you, uh, you absorb it
[SPEAKER_01]: buccaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into your mouth and it goes right
into your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why send the, the cannabinoids on a
wild goose chase through your digestive
[SPEAKER_01]: track and through the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they gotta go all travel through the
whole body before they get to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little, little crazy trip they have
to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not just load the magic school bus
and send it right, right to the brain and
[SPEAKER_01]: avoiding, um, some complications
potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have option, you know, the point of
this is, is your only option isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your only option isn't oral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are potentially other strategies
that you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are great conversations
to have with the, your PCP or your primary
[SPEAKER_01]: care physician, not talking about another
drug there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, the, or, or any medical
health professional, um, doctors are
[SPEAKER_01]: trained to talk about drug, drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can look up any of this information
quickly, or you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to me or check out, you know,
rewind the show and pull some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: references we talk about, um, and bring
those to your clinician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to advise medical cannabis patients
when I did a lot of advocacy and give
[SPEAKER_01]: them, you know, papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's like a couple clinicians
at like Kaiser or some medical place in
[SPEAKER_01]: California or being like, who the hell was
giving my patients all those peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: studies and having them bring them to my
office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was sometimes arming, uh,
medical cannabis patients with peer
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewed studies to share with their
clinician, to have these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: How should I consume it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits and risks of
consuming these products topically,
[SPEAKER_01]: orally, sub mucosally, um, by inhalation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and these are all, and in what amounts
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all great conversations to
continue to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you said, it's going to continue to
change because products change,
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of cannabis change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's always good to just check
in about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, when we come back from our
commercial break in set three,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about some,
uh, uh, red flag drugs and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: categories of drugs, um, that we want to
be especially aware of, um, if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patient or you are doing,
um, uh, you know, caregiving for somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we'll go through those,
um, with, uh, Jay Han.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we're going to take a short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is molecular
pharmacologist, Jay Han Marku,
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online cannabis seed distributors often
seem to be all the same, but multiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: beans constantly works to provide you with
cannabis seeds and a buying experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that you won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse beans works directly with the
breeders to secure as many packs of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites as possible so that they have
your favorite beans long after others have
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shops simply buy breeder minimums,
but I get messages all the time from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders saying some version of multiverse
asked to buy my entire run at multiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find rare cannabis seeds from
night owl seeds, including the dark owl
[SPEAKER_00]: sub label, Mephisto genetics, square one,
genetics, Robin hood seeds and ethos,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse also initiates projects with
breeders to secure exclusive packs that
[SPEAKER_00]: you simply won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse founder, Paul law sees himself
not only as a curator of the best cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds available, but also as a
collaborator with breeders trying to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: novel crosses to the market that his

[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
Hembra Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hembra recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.

Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gaslamp Seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helene and Caitlin get it.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shangalos, and my guest
today is molecular pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jehan Marku, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jehan, you know, we've talked a lot
about like the mindset and the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives and the complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've teased these things apart mostly
just so people can see like all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different avenues that we could say are
avenues of concern, but they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: avenues of solutions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because usually by the time a cannabis
patient is either A, us and sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: or B, we are a caregiver and we've been
called in to help out, usually there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem to be resolved and healing to be
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to ask you is that
there have got to be some categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals that are just red flag
because they are like up at the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: list of drugs that are likely to interact
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while our goal today has been to like
hopefully arm cannabis patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers with lots of different ways to,
you know, dive into what they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: suss out, there's probably a few that we
should just put a big red flag on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't we go through two or
three of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's at the top of your list of red
flag drugs that are going to interact in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in potentially sketchy ways?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, things to be concerned about
first, I'm going to start with alphabet
[SPEAKER_01]: soup real quick, and then we'll go into
more specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're taking, um, potential drug,
drug interactions have to do with drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking at SIP, C Y P two C nine
healthcare professionals will know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are listening, pulling out a
little piece of paper and writing these
[SPEAKER_01]: down and then throwing them into a search
browser, it will reveal all, but a SIP two
[SPEAKER_01]: C nine SIP one A two SIP two B six and SIP
two C 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and even some of the acidic
cannabinoids, um, like THC THC VA,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, CBD, CBD VA, um, CBGA, these all
interact, for example, with SIP two C
[SPEAKER_01]: nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have taking a medication,
which is probably, you know, it's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are very common targets of
medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could have a victim perpetrator
effect going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of red flag potentials,
you know, um, you know, I used to think
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I want, um, you know, I already,
uh, you know, have my own podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought about starting another one
just called what the hell happened where
[SPEAKER_01]: people would call in with, um,
drug experiences and be like, I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having fun at this party and I just
got a lot headed and passed out and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, these stories, um,
you know, joke a little bit there to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: the tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is about hypertension and
hypotension and, and the hypotensive
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people probably don't even notice,
or it's transient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been sitting down for a while
playing a board game or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, FIFA on your X-Box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you step up, Oh, I feel a little
lightheaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you like, Oh, I'm better now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people that is really severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're taking cardiovascular
medication, I think you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: cardiovascular condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great idea to really pause and
think about things and maybe have a
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion because, um, cannabis does
cause hypotension.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blood vessels, uh, you know,
will dilate, um, and the heart heart will
[SPEAKER_01]: work a little harder to pump blood around
because, you know, things are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that hypotension could result in
being so lightheaded that you have to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down or, you know, you really feel,
feel the pull of the gravity of the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and just bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be, that could be bad,
especially if you hit something on the way
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say red flag interaction,
cardiovascular medications that treat
[SPEAKER_01]: hypertension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I would say look,
look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on, um, anything to do with
cardiovascular medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd say, um, or a warfare in,
um, and I, I pronounce drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little weirdly cause I had, uh,
my mentor was from Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one of our collaborators that I
listened to a lot, uh, was born in
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotland and spent 30 years in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm used to hearing trucks pronounced
really weird ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know the correct way to say
apoptosis or apoptosis or apt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's all these ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, bear with me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, warfare in is one,
and this is, uh, most people probably find
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so you, if you take that,
you could potentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where cannabinoids are
perpetrators warfare and we'll stick
[SPEAKER_01]: around longer, um, increased risk of
excessive bleeding there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that would be potential red flag,
something to think about, consider again,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where this mantra we hear or start
low and go slow comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we mentioned clobazam and this really
is again, a risk of, um, benzodiazepine
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and most notably with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so again, thinking about
benzodiazepines and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you may want to proceed slowly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, central nervous depressants could have
additive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, the, the, a lot of the pains,
the closet pain and a lands a pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, will have reduced efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, that, um, you know,
and again, I'll just tie it in the sip
[SPEAKER_01]: three, a four, and sip two C nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you should think about,
um, those and drug, drug interactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: few of drugs are metabolized or interact
with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say discuss alternatives,
um, that might be appropriate in that
[SPEAKER_01]: instance, just based on the literature and
what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be clinically feasible,
so you might have to consider,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different routes of
administration or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that, uh, the club is an,
which is a, a benzodiazepam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so while that one, most of us don't
come across in our regular life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I believe another benzodiazepam is
Valium, which is like all through,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, our scene and you know,
you know, your aunt gives one to you or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, these are very common
to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we, should we be careful similarly
mixing Valium with cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say probably true for any
anti-anxiety medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even antidepressants, Zoloft prox,
uh, Prozac Lexapro, um, just like naming
[SPEAKER_01]: things off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these things even like carry
over to the psychedelic space too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people, you're not supposed to,
you know, go on a psilocybin therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: session while on these things either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, you know, mostly what we're
concerned about with a cannabis or hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: product is that these increased side
effects, dizziness, drowsiness,
[SPEAKER_01]: confusion, um, and other difficulties when
you're using a diazepam together with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, everyone's going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people will probably just be
like, I do that all the time and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people are going to be like,
I'm never doing that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're really talking about here,
I think is, you know, cannabis can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial thing in people's life and we
don't want it to be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people's life, or at least have no net
effect, no net effect and a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really trying to figure out
how do we prevent people from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having to utter the phrase,
I'm never doing that again, or that was
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think of how hard the
cannabis industry has worked to get where
[SPEAKER_01]: it is and you don't want a first time
patient who could benefit from cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the wrong product, have a drug drug
owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interaction or a side effect and say,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never touching that stuff again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might've just been a simple issue
as timing route of administration,
[SPEAKER_01]: or again, dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus on one thing that you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense that if you would
take a, a benzo diazepam like volume or
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanax and add, um, THC, uh, blend to it
that you are going, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are more likely to, you know,
have, have decreased dexterity and
[SPEAKER_00]: increased drowsiness and, you know,
won't be able to drive your car as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things that like slow your human
down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you caught me off guard when you,
when you mentioned those SSRIs because so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people who are taking, you know,
uh, you know, some of these, these,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, long-term anxiety and
depression medications like Wellbutrin
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, that whole basket that
you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them also supplement with cannabis
either for quality of life or just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because they still have residual
anxiety even on those drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what is the mechanism of cannabis
interacting with this, this basket of
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything that patients who
are blending those themselves at home
[SPEAKER_00]: should watch out for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nexus of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, the antidepressants are,
it's a very broad feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we could think about maybe,
um, like Fluxatine or Prozac.
Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, you know, some of these have
like that one I like to talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause again, it has no known drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to, to information available,
but it can have overlapping, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be more in the
pharmacodynamic area, um, with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd have to dig in a little bit deeper
on some of the mechanisms of actions,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with those pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about in use then.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, so maybe, maybe I caught you off
guard with the actual, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacodynamics, but if you are taking,
um, you know, one of these SSRIs with
[SPEAKER_00]: these, with the side effects that you
would want to be cautious of when taking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the same ones as the
benzodiazepams are we, are we with the
[SPEAKER_00]: SSRIs, are we still talking about,
um, um, uh, uh, like loss of dexterity
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, sedation and
difficulty driving cars or, or are we
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about something, you know,
potentially more serious like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, serotonin poisoning or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might, I think you might
experience, um, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so some of the SSRIs specifically,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so talipram I think is a pretty
popular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extensively metabolized by,
um, SIP2C19.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the alphabet soup things I
mentioned in the beginning of this thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one of the major enzymes that
metabolize cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you could run the risk of having
cannabinoids be a victim of an
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction, which could make them more or
less effective, make them more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: have an unwanted effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, just going back to that analogy
of the guy strutting around town with
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to do, might walk down the down
street or just, you know, it's okay to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the street when it's not
busy and do your work that you need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can get more dangerous the longer
you sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, again, just to try and,
and cobble together an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think with the, some of those
SSRIs, you might be thinking it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: go either way, victim or perpetrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, you know, kind of at the
limit, I think of a lot of information out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you, even if you go, you know,
I worked with, uh, with Penn state,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a cannabis research center there
and then been advising and participating
[SPEAKER_01]: with their center and they put up,
um, uh, like a, like a little database
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can put in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look up a potential drug, drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, it's like,
I think of it like this, like they've made
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach and a little bit of shoreline
and you can wade into the water and
[SPEAKER_01]: explore what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go any deeper and like
see dolphins and, you know, the shipwrecks
[SPEAKER_01]: and things that we're not there yet with
being able to go to that level of
[SPEAKER_01]: exploration, but we do know that SSRIs and
cannabinoids do share common routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be, um, something to think
about, um, you know, because not every
[SPEAKER_01]: SSRI goes through the, the same,
um, sip, but a lot of them do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the last, um, medicine category
I want to, I want to touch on,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it may be a specialty that you may or
may not like, you know, overlap with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but what about, um, uh, children,
children's medicines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, you know, the fact that,
uh, children who have got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a range of issues, you know, very,
very easily pointing at like
[SPEAKER_00]: immunocompromised type kids, like they
have, uh, literally been the poster
[SPEAKER_00]: children for cannabis medicine and helping
to expand it, you know, over the last 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years, because, um, you know, the way that
cannabis medicine helps kids, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it, it, it pulls at your heartstrings
and people are like, yeah, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: these kids should be able to be using
cannabis oil for their seizures and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let's get this law passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, uh, would you have anything to
add about interaction between,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cannabinoids, which might be coming
from a parent who is feeling desperate and
[SPEAKER_00]: other pharmaceuticals that they might
already be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to reiterate, we are not giving
medical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're doing is pointing out things
for, um, caregivers to stay aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so glad that we're talking about this
because so often when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, normal adult volunteers in a
research study, we extrapolate that to the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the absence of pediatric drug,
drug information, adult information is
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, there are subtle differences
in development and all sorts of things
[SPEAKER_01]: between children and adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just look at the differences
between a two year old and an eight year
[SPEAKER_01]: old and a 15 year old, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's a huge, you know,
and so the magnitude of a drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: drug interaction in a pediatric patient
population may differ from adults because
[SPEAKER_01]: of age dependent changes, puberty and
prepubescent, for example, can change the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug disposition or response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, in some of the early studies
with, uh, THC compounds in pediatric
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, like by the late Raphael
Bishulam, you know, they didn't really see
[SPEAKER_01]: what they thought that what they would see
in adults given that compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, the brains are still in
a high state of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there may not be the
same response to THC or other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be other factors,
dose formulation, the disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: disease state, the body mass, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say again that the, it needs to
be assessed in children separately from
[SPEAKER_01]: adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a challenging thing,
but careful consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to account for age dependent
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you have to build a little more
confidence, um, about that, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it may, you know, these,
these, again, these DDIs are routinely
[SPEAKER_01]: performed in healthy adult volunteers and
early clinical studies, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of ethical logistical and
method challenges to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing these types of study in pediatric
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, uh, I don't know if
you've ever tried to get like a four year
[SPEAKER_01]: old to fill out a, a form or a survey
might be a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, adults can, can do that thing just
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a whole range of it,
but you know, pop pediatric patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hospital often receive multiple drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are efforts to characterize,
um, those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like this phrase that you've got age
dependent changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you were talking about
kids, but that definitely applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: adults too, because I know that,
um, the effects that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, my, my plant based drugs and fungus
based drugs and my pharmaceutical based
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, they have all changed as I've
gotten older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my reaction to it, you know,
I was kind of impervious in my twenties
[SPEAKER_00]: and now, you know, I'm a little more aware
because it's a, you know, it's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: knock me out of balance, but I like that
phrase age dependent changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I could give one solid example.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is across the board example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not special.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to say across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime there's a, I think morphine and
opioids, fentanyl, um, combined with
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in a clinical setting,
um, can have effects on respiratory
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is something I think,
especially when we talk about chronic
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases, hospitalization, outpatient
stuff, you know, just because in adult
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, we're observing this
phenomenon of, um, decreased opioid,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, overdoses and deaths in adult
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is the thing that we talk
about the age dependence, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be quite as clear cut in
pediatric population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to throw that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, um, you know, you can,
you can look at this up, uh, don't take my
[SPEAKER_01]: word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some of your own research, but again,
you can find a lot of information about,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, these are the potential most
difficult areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two more questions before we
wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that, uh, you know,
it was our goal today to not answer every
[SPEAKER_00]: potential question that could be answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And asked about this because there's,
it's just too complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would need 20 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but, but our goal was to help give,
give patients and caregivers a,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a, a perspective of how to suss out
their solutions and their unique
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to, uh, I want to kind of
like, uh, you kind of like throw you this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of umbrella question for you to
answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in what manner would you recommend
patients and caregivers go about their own
[SPEAKER_00]: research to discover if they may be
having, you know, interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: their pharma and their cannabis,
very specifically, let's say that either,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're the patient or you're the
caregiver and you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think that might be what we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say is their first and
their second step to try to suss that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep, uh, meticulous records.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and that doesn't have to
mean you're journaling all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that you are a bit vigilant
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're controlling your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, if you're like,
Oh, I went to brunch and drank four
[SPEAKER_01]: mimosas and then I took my medicine and
then later that night I smoked cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and boy did I feel funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must've had a drug, drug interaction
with cannabis and those, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my, my prescription meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could be the alcohol,
could be other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then could be diet, also plays a
role.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think first thing to do, get a
journal, find the criteria, find some
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's no shortage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of like questionnaires.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could even draw smiley faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do I feel frowny face today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I feel flatline smile today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a, you know, people use those
types of charts, um, and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, different scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find your scales, find your
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, I think, um, uh,
keeping track of what you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have talked to patients and caregivers
in the past and sometimes they'll say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if you have a label on a product,
take a picture, keep a digital journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do it, it's almost like a
scrapbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a journal, you can peel off the
product label, put it in your journal or
[SPEAKER_01]: write down the information from it and
keep track of what you're taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're taking it, um, and when you're
taking other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is even a strategy that's used
for pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doctors will be like, okay,
well you're taking drug X, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribe you drug Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take them both in the morning and
you feel X or Y, then then take this drug
[SPEAKER_01]: two hours later, take it four hours later,
take it six hours later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so start by taking, if you're new to
this, everything, you know, this is based
[SPEAKER_01]: on literature that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo and McCallum have a great paper on
dosing strategies and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking things at night and low amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's okay, feels all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't feel the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, start to play with the
timing and the dosing and finding that
[SPEAKER_01]: range where you're not getting adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you don't feel good,
um, you know, it's, it's not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get, if you get like all the side
effects of cannabis, like, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel sedated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mouth is dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I feel dizzy and I can't remember
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a lot of boxes to check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may not be what you're looking
for from a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, I think it has to do with,
um, keeping track of the inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: control as many variables as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think usually you'll start to,
you'll find that there's a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be like, wow, I've been drinking
caffeine all day and, uh, or I,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I haven't been drinking it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think finding those baselines,
um, will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a database that you recommend
more than Google?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after the patient journals and
they've got some, um, suspicions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably going to search these
drugs and cannabis and see what they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Google may be our best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always a big fan of the project
CBD.org conditions section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that, that's always great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, is, is Google still our best bet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, until AI takes over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, she, you know, the internet
can be helpful and I would look for
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple resources that corroborate your
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just take the computer's word for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a couple references online from
different types of sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the Mayo clinic, maybe PubMed.gov,
uh, maybe from, uh, a webinar where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a doctor talking about stuff like
use, use, uh, you know, you have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: on this challenge using all available
resources to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause things often just because the same
study is cited over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again, doesn't mean the study itself is
reproducible and the results are
[SPEAKER_01]: translatable to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finding, um, you know, the
information from diverse sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: finding the same thing, the same results
from different people running the studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and different reputable organizations come
to the same conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, as they say, try and find
something written, something you can watch
[SPEAKER_01]: something on someone you can talk to,
to corroborate the evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I think, you know, that,
that is, um, just kind of where we're at
[SPEAKER_01]: because AI and the internet love to lie to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the ongoing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, AI will just make stuff up to
make you happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows what you want to hear or want to
read or want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we have to always be suspicious of
forgetting, you know, exactly hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what we want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you're probably about to buy
a used car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be, be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that what I would say is
try and test things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's okay, if I believe X, let me try
and stretch out X as far as it can go this
[SPEAKER_01]: line of thinking until it breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the weakness in this, this
rationale, whatever it is you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at drug, drug interactions or
significance, they're, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last question, um, I want to hit on
with our last two minutes here is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I want to, uh, go back to and plug the
buds info.com project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I have talked about that,
um, you know, uh, before we started and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, you know, the, the listeners of
shaping fire knows that we support,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cannabis research and we are always
trying to plug, um, uh, research that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We participated in, you know, Ethan
Russo's, you know, CBD and CBG projects
[SPEAKER_00]: before sending people their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, you've told me about
the, the good folks behind, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: buds info.com and, and I looked it up and
it looks like something legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so my question for you is,
is, is what does the research look like to
[SPEAKER_00]: unearth these interactions that you and I
have been discussing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, um, what kind of research is
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then give me a brief plug for buds
info.com and then we'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my exploration of research
has been, you know, a lot of frustration
[SPEAKER_01]: with getting funding and grants and you
know, in some ways, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: always waiting on grants and, and maybe
private funding from the industry or
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time has gone on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found more and more ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just said, you know what,
this summer, I'm just going to do the dang
[SPEAKER_01]: research and I'm not going to wait for
funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bootstrap this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to invest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many databases out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much you can find at the tips
of your fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just willing to spend time doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and so unearthing the research
for me, you know, um, doing case reports,
[SPEAKER_01]: contacting clinicians and starting to
unearth these things where they have these
[SPEAKER_01]: patient files, no one, they're busy
clinicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have time to go through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of most of it's like, you know,
not it's like, I can't read this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not like the best of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find nuggets, you find signals,
you know, it's like, it's like searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for extraterrestrial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly you hear an alien TV show and
you're like, what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, I picked up a signal,
you know, um, and I have to say digging
[SPEAKER_01]: through, we had a paper come out recently
about Delta eight THC derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we comb through, um, you know,
the lead epidemiologist, um, on the paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, brought this to our attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's this database.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can access it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can run these queries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole team together to go
through the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really exciting because,
you know, this is data that's people are
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting to the, FDA to poison control
centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to comb through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, we requested more and more
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent us case reports, hospital files,
you know, the products, uh, scanned and
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of the products, along with the
reports from the patients and why they
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up to the ER, what they were
feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came to realize that one,
the classification system for how these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are entering the databases,
not useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, psilocybin has a E at the end of it in
the FDA database.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you search psilocybin, you will find
nothing, but if you search psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, if you look up, uh,
cannabinoid, you may not find anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look up, you know, you,
if you think about Delta nine THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it plus minus version or the minus
minus version?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what version is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there are some issues around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a bit of knowing where to
look, what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that led us to create buds info.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, you know, there's an explosion
of product diversity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as a colleague told me,
where are the guard rails?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and so we, we decided to
bootstrap this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buds info.com, please check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please scan it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to use this to centralize
the collection of data, standardize the
[SPEAKER_01]: data right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is an issue with a Canada
cannabis product hemp, product,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a vulnerable population, it goes to
local state or city centers and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it, or not at all to a central
database.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may not, we may never, some of this
stuff, we may be quite late to the game to
[SPEAKER_01]: uncover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been very, I have to say,
it's been very exciting to be sort of on
[SPEAKER_01]: this forefront of public health where
we're finding signals and very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you know, as, as you would
expect, there are not a lot of adverse
[SPEAKER_01]: events for whole plant cannabis compared
to other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, there's not a lot of adverse
events being reported yet for
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics, but it might be again,
cause people can't find psilocybin in the
[SPEAKER_01]: database to report it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there, there are a lot of
interesting issues where we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing and trying to figure out,
are we using the right metrics to detect
[SPEAKER_01]: these signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not about saying cannabis
is good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, we want everyone's ship to
reach a safe Harbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to know where that big rock is
in the Harbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't run a ground and,
and yeah, let's bring this on home there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what you want to do, dear listener
is go to budsinfo.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a short form there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is very easy to fill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the questions are about, um,
if you've ever had adverse experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis and for you to describe
that, um, I went ahead and filled one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me like, like four minutes tops
and, uh, and Jay, they're, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all, uh, anonymous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going into like some tagged
database or anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is completely anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this in full compliance that
we don't need an IRB board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other great thing about research is
learning how to be like when you need
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things and when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's totally anonymized.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was started by students.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's largely run by students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we are trying to perfect this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that versus trying to find
the med form watch, um, or a poison
[SPEAKER_01]: control center form, I think we have
figured out the, as you just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes four minutes to fill out and it's
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, what will help federally
regulate and federally legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is knowing the risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I strongly believe that that if we
can clearly communicate that we know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the risks are and we're continuing to
commitment to track what those might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't think anything will stand in
the way of complete legalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
