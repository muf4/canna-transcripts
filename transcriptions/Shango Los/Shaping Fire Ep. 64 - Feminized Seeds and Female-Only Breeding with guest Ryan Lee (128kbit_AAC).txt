[SPEAKER_01]: As more and more people begin to grow
their own cannabis, the popularity of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds has risen remarkably.
[SPEAKER_01]: As new growers come to understand the
inconveniences associated with using
[SPEAKER_01]: regular male-female seeds, feminized seeds
have become an increasingly attractive
[SPEAKER_01]: option.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a listener unfamiliar with
feminized seeds, these are the three most
[SPEAKER_01]: common reasons people choose feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, a patient is legally
limited to how many plants they can grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: so each plant is exceptionally valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, cannabis seeds will
germinate and become plants that are 50%
[SPEAKER_01]: male and 50% female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pop your regular seeds,
you should expect about half to be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that 50-50 only plays out
statistically over thousands of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it is entirely possible for you to pop
six seeds and have four or five of them be
[SPEAKER_01]: male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is exceptionally disheartening for a
patient to discover that so many of their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are male when they need female
plants to make their medicine and get
[SPEAKER_01]: relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all of the soil and nutrients and
care and love the patient has given the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, it is a significant disappointment
to have to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of this, many patients love
feminized seeds because it removes the
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of cultivating plants that end in
wasted effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivators who are growing more plants
than a patient, but less than a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator, often need to make clones to
extend what they can do with a small
[SPEAKER_01]: number of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This often means going through the arduous
process of popping the seed, letting it
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, taking clones, flowering a clone to
determine the sex of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then planting the clones that prove
female while calling the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: That process takes some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is far more convenient to pop a female
seed and just start cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confident that the new clones are all
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, commercial scale growers are
now embracing feminized seeds too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cultivators have a choice of
either to use clones or feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fem seeds are easier to store and have
that vigor that comes with a seed instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now though, feminized seeds are a bit
more variable than clones, so many still
[SPEAKER_01]: use clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, there are plenty of great
reasons to grow male-female regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is focusing on the benefits
and challenges of feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: female-only breeding though, so we won't
be talking about the reasons we like regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an episode exalting the female.

[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan is a professional cannabis researcher
and plant breeder specializing in cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: design and the inheritance of therapeutic
compounds in cannabis, including
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: His background training is in neuroscience
and studying the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: with a strong focus on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: His post-grad work at the University of
British Columbia is all about plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan Lee is founder of Chimera Genetic
Resource Management and the Chimavar
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera is essentially a seed bank and a
cannabis germplasm firm operating in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimavar Corp is based in Canada and
focuses on breeding specialty cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, laboratory analytics,
cultivation consulting, cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, and germplasm sourcing,
licensing, and importation for Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimavar has guided clients worldwide to
navigate international regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding the movement of cannabis
genetic material in addition to sourcing
[SPEAKER_01]: and importing cannabis starting materials
as the foundation for corporate cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production, academic research,
and large-scale breeding programs focused
[SPEAKER_01]: on next-generation cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk about the
creation and genetic makeup of feminine
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and we're going to do a dive into
female-only breeding too, which is super
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with some vocabulary because
we're going to go through a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: various myths around feminized seeds
today, but one of the first things is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much a comprehensive confusion
between the vocabulary of feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you clarify and tease those apart for
us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feminized seeds is a word that really I
think was coined or made up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a word that we use in botany,
but what it really means is seeds that you
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and they grow out to be all females.
[SPEAKER_03]: This discussion is really going to come
into some words that people might have
[SPEAKER_03]: heard when talking about buying seeds,
different cannabis seed types.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have monaceous seeds or dioaceous seeds
and hemp tends to be monoaceous,
[SPEAKER_03]: which means that we have both male and
female flowers on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drug cannabis is at the other end of the
spectrum where we have male and female
[SPEAKER_03]: plants occurring on separate individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes from the Greek word oikos,
which means home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monaceous means both of the sexes reside
in one home, whereas dioaceous means the
[SPEAKER_03]: sexes reside in two separate homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The word feminized really is a more
user-friendly term for what botanists
[SPEAKER_03]: called gynoecious, which means the female
house or all the seeds in the population
[SPEAKER_03]: being from the female gender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If feminized seeds are gynoecious,
where in that model does a self seed live?
[SPEAKER_03]: A self seed is a specific type of
feminized seed where the pollen donor and
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant that actually holds the seed,
which we call the seed mother,
[SPEAKER_03]: are genetically the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most severe form of inbreeding
one can do on any given species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that's quite unnatural for
cannabis, cannabis in its natural state of
[SPEAKER_03]: dioacea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to come across a wild stand of
cannabis somewhere walking through a
[SPEAKER_03]: valley in Tibet or somewhere,
approximately half of the plants would be
[SPEAKER_03]: female and half of the plants would be
males.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a natural condition for any plant to
leave its offspring that it has to mate
[SPEAKER_03]: with another individual of the same
species, kind of like humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really quite rare in the plant
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a whole bunch of consequences on
genetic diversity and a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: other things that we're going to talk
about over the next hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, tomatoes, they naturally self
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a natural state for a bumblebee to
come along and play with the flower on the
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That causes a self fertilization where the
male parts of that individual flower
[SPEAKER_03]: interact with the female parts or the
bumblebee transfers the pollen from one
[SPEAKER_03]: part to the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That creates a fruit in which there are
seeds growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy heirloom tomato seeds off the
internet and the company sends you a
[SPEAKER_03]: package of seeds and you take those seeds
and grow them into a full plant and you
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest the tomatoes and you take the
seeds and you plant them again the next
[SPEAKER_03]: year, the plants from the next year and
the fruit from those plants from the next
[SPEAKER_03]: year will be near identical, if not
identical, to the seeds that you grew out
[SPEAKER_03]: on the first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to take those seeds and
continually save them and plant them in
[SPEAKER_03]: your garden over the next 10 to 15 years,
you could expect that those tomatoes are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the same every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas we've come to see that's not the
case in cannabis and that really has to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with this natural state of breeding where
every individual must interact with
[SPEAKER_03]: another individual to create progeny,
kind of like humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are selfed seeds all female?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not necessarily because you can
actually self.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little trick for making female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should talk about first how a
feminized seed is made.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of different chemicals,
but the one that's most commonly used is a
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical called silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver thiosulfate blocks one of the five
major plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that happens on cannabis,
when you take a female cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: you induce it to flower and immediately
spray it with silver thiosulfate,
[SPEAKER_03]: the silver ion blocks the ethylene in that
biological pathway that leads to female
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consequence is that this female,
genetically female plant will produce male
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers and thus they will produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a trait of a male plant to be able
to produce pollen and it's very atypical
[SPEAKER_03]: for a female plant to be able to produce
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference being between male pollen
and female derived pollen is that the
[SPEAKER_03]: female pollen has no Y chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has no uniquely genetically male
contributions that are being passed on to
[SPEAKER_03]: the next offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it allows us to do is mate one female
with another or in the case of self seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can mate one female plant with itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Self seeds are really, we do see a little
bit of them appearing on the commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: market, but it's really a breeder's tool
for doing what we would call severe
[SPEAKER_03]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time that I have come across,
in my own hands, S1s, self seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Caleb over at CSI
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the show and he said that one of
the reasons that he likes self seeds is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it gives you a decent snapshot of
many of the different phenos that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the parent plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas with regular seeds,
when you get them, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiation of phenos, but you may not
get everything that's to be kind of sloppy
[SPEAKER_01]: with my vocabulary in the line of that
parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you have an S1, it kind of
creates, normally we go for seeds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: all the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all the seeds you get out of a
pack are kind of similar and similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder's cut, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which for many people would consider like
the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got your breeder's cut and then
you try to make seeds that exemplify the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder's cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But S1, self seeds, people seem to kind of
go at it in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like I've got the Skittles S1 that
Caleb made and I know that if I had enough
[SPEAKER_01]: packs of that S1, I only have one,
but let's say I had four or five,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have kind of a snapshot of all the
variety that's in the Skittles line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have a general accurate understanding
of that snapshot of the genetic line?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, where am I off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to say yes and no.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so an S1 is what we call a
recombination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recombinant generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that means is, again,
I have to back up a little bit and to try
[SPEAKER_03]: to explain this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll use humans as a way to do that
because I think it's easier for people to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about sex in terms of humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has a mother and a father and a
lot of people have a brother or a sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we imagine that the mother is the
ideal type or as you call the breeder's
[SPEAKER_03]: cut, our idea is that we want to mate her
and have the progeny end up being like
[SPEAKER_03]: her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in plant breeding and really in all
breeding, we have this basic tenant,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is like begets like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that that means is if you take a
plant that has blue petals, it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: likely that the offspring of that plant
will also have blue petals.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we know from our experience with
humans, you don't look like your mother or
[SPEAKER_03]: father .
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have some of their traits,
but you're not an identical replication of
[SPEAKER_03]: of the mother.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And.
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically when people have made
cannabis seeds, what they do is they look
[SPEAKER_03]: through a population of any type,
maybe it's a land race, maybe it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed pack they bought from Holland or
California, and they grow these seeds out
[SPEAKER_03]: and you select an ideal plant that is
excellent or good on a whole series of
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if a breeder wants to then make seeds
from that plant, you have to go looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for a pollen source or traditionally
you've had to go looking for a pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what people do is they take their
own favorite line and they use that plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to pollinate their new selected mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the problem is, is that following
the like begets like tenant that I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned earlier, we're now introducing
traits from a father type that might not
[SPEAKER_03]: be identical to the mother type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one, you know, the easiest
plant, the most the plant that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: most like the mother plant would be the
mother plant itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could find a way to produce it or to
make that plant produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we use this chemical trick where we
spray this ethylene blocker on the female
[SPEAKER_03]: plant when it's entering flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows the plant to produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Male flowers from which we can harvest the
pollen and then self pollinate the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but still, we have to remember that
that mother plant came herself as a hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: from two different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those plants were were almost
identical, and if they were almost
[SPEAKER_03]: identical, if we self the plant,
that those self seeds would be very
[SPEAKER_03]: similar, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They might they might even all be
identical to the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the if the mother plant that we're
using is herself, a hybrid, meaning she
[SPEAKER_03]: has, you know, genetics from two different
types, when we when we self that plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to expose all of the genetic
combinations that exist within her genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exciting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you're a pheno hunter,
you know, if you're looking for unique
[SPEAKER_01]: traits, that sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're looking for consistency in
seeds, well, then you'd want the first
[SPEAKER_01]: version.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of being able to see all of
the wonderful varieties also sounds fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And typically, traditionally, in the plant
breeding world, that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that pheno hunt is that you're talking
about, it really has been the goal of the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder, the breeder's goal is to put out,
you know, as a commercial seed buyer,
[SPEAKER_03]: you want all the plants to look the same,
or I would think that you want all plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to look the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you might be interested in
looking at the variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for most people that are
buying commercial seeds, they expect,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said, a representation of a
described plant, aka the breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if most people want consistency,
or what a lot of people call a stable
[SPEAKER_01]: line, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, whereas people will say,
oh, no, this is a breeder's pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of variety for you
to pheno hunt in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's kind of I think that
honestly, breeders have been able to hide
[SPEAKER_03]: behind that fat that type of marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, you know, the last 30 years,
and breeders have typically sold the
[SPEAKER_03]: variation as a positive when I think that
really, it's a feature, not a flaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's I think, you know, that's
partly the part of the reason is that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the people working with cannabis
are unlike Caleb are not real plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just people making seeds to sell
for money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those and that, you know, plant
breeding is a skill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, there's an education to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to learn the laws of how
plant breeding and biology and meiosis
[SPEAKER_03]: work in order to be able to use them as
tools to your advantage in creating a true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so self seeds are a way to get to that
true breeding line, but they in that they
[SPEAKER_03]: in and of themselves may not be a good a
good way to produce stable seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean that they don't have
their use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I you know, to me, selfing is a tool
in a breeder's toolbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the mechanics of using
silver theosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like about our
conversations before today is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you've got the education and you
are a scientist and it you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my experience, you describe things
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you take us through the process
of using silver theosulfate to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: make a feminine seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this may seem awfully basic for
you, but most of us can't get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: description anywhere because people
describe things kind of sloppily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even Caleb, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who you and I both agree is a great
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he was on the show, he's all like,
he's like, man, I kind of just do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and fair enough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So his expertise is making seeds,
not necessarily, you know, teaching it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to put that on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like once we've scored some silver
theosulfate, you know, also what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people call it feminization
spray sometimes, like what do you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's important to understand
how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't need to use the silver
theosulfate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The theosulfate component is kind of like
a buffer or a transporter to help bring
[SPEAKER_03]: the silver into the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the first researchers were looking at
these things, I guess it's important to
[SPEAKER_03]: say too, there's five major plant hormones
in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously we have many,
many more, but in plants, there's about
[SPEAKER_03]: five hormones that regulate most of the
dance of life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those hormones is ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people know the consequences
of ethylene by taking a green banana and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting it in a paper bag and kind of
cinching it closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the banana will go yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is, is the paper bag is
trapping that ethylene gas, which in the
[SPEAKER_03]: case of bananas and many types of fruit,
it causes ripening.
[SPEAKER_03]: In flowers, it causes flowers to stay
open.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the cut flower industry,
you'll actually see flower producers
[SPEAKER_03]: typically, you know, all over the world,
but they, you know, if they're shipping
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers from say Costa Rica to California
for the market, one of the tricks to slow
[SPEAKER_03]: down the ripening process is to spray
silver theosulfate on the freshly
[SPEAKER_03]: harvested flower buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that blocks the action of ethylene and
stops the ripening or slows the ripening
[SPEAKER_03]: process, allowing for a longer harvest
window, you might say, or a longer
[SPEAKER_03]: transportation window.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just provides shelf life stability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plant people spray these types of
chemicals on plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess a researcher was trying to
look at the effect of silver nitrate,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is very much like silver
theosulfate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sprayed it on the cannabis plants and
they realized that this action would turn
[SPEAKER_03]: female plants phenotypically male.
[SPEAKER_03]: The female plants would produce male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does that by blocking the action of
ethylene at this ethylene receptor,
[SPEAKER_03]: much like, you know, much like Narcan
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the opioid or the opioid rescue drug,
it blocks the receptor and stops the
[SPEAKER_03]: action of the fentanyl of the heroin and
essentially revives the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So silver theosulfate does much of the
same thing, except the end result is that
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant about two to three weeks later
will start producing male flowers rather
[SPEAKER_03]: than female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we then harvest that pollen or we put
that plant in the same room or a
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination chamber with, you know,
either another clone of the same
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically the same plant for making self
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we could put another plant of a
different genotype in the same chamber as
[SPEAKER_03]: well to make hybrid feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd put another female in with your
female that you are applying the silver
[SPEAKER_01]: theosulfate to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call that plant the donor plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the donor plant essentially becomes
your, you know, air quote males,
[SPEAKER_03]: your air quote male plant or your pollen
donor plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And any other plants that you want to
receive that pollen, you essentially put
[SPEAKER_03]: them in the same chamber or the same grow
chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will also be pollinated from that
one pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can make self seeds and you can
make hybrid seeds at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For home growers who may not, who want to
give this a whirl, but they may not have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, dedicated seed chambers and
enough room for multiple plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: would it be legit to, uh, spray the
silver, um, thiosulfate on say,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, lower branches and then just
let the, you know, have a fan in there so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the pollen goes around the tent and
then self pollinates the female flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are up higher in the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think most people that are playing
with around with breeding at home,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't really need, I mean,
that, that could potentially produce many
[SPEAKER_03]: hundreds or even thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for most home growers,
you know, 20 or 30 or 40 seeds is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient to play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, you, you could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could spray one branch if you wanted
to, but then you risk pollinating the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably wiser to, um, spray a small
clone that you can isolate from the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you, then you can collect the
pollen from that, that newly male plant or
[SPEAKER_03]: the pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can just take that pollen and
either apply it by hand or with a
paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the lower branches of your choice is
the only downside to pollinating the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire plant, just that it's going to
decrease the potency of the smoke will
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause as far as I'm concerned,
if I was going to go to all this fricking
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble, I would want to pollinate that
whole donor plant so that it makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: most seeds possible for the labor that I'm
putting in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can, but it's, again,
it's not a very, you might want it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a, in a, in a small plant
with say four or five large main colas,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could really produce a few hundred
seeds of four different types,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put a different pollen donor on
every branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, again, I think for most home,
home growers, it would be more efficient
[SPEAKER_03]: to just pollinate single branches rather
than the full plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even if you just wanted to,
you know, if you say you're growing a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of plants outside, you could just
pollinate one branch by creating a small
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we call them pollen bags and they're
essentially just little parchment paper
[SPEAKER_03]: sachet satchels, but you can put pollen in
that and then tape over, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: tape the end, the open end over a bag and
it's white.
[SPEAKER_03]: So light still gets through it because
it's parchment paper, it still breathes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way you can actually create seeds
on one plant, um, or sorry, on one branch
[SPEAKER_03]: of one pollen type without pollinating the
rest of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that pollen bag for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm familiar with, uh, taking the
pollen and painting it on with a,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a small, uh, uh, paintbrush,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's fun and, uh,
easy to do these pollen bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the pollen is in the bag,
the pollen can't go through the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to, you're going to put
it over the branch and you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to tape it off to close the seal on
the far end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like shake, shake the bag once a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how, how did, cause I'm just imagining
the pollen sitting in the, in the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the lower, yeah, it's when you make
the bag, it's in the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag, but you turn the bag upside down as
you put it on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of comes, you know,
I was thinking of it like a sock being put
[SPEAKER_03]: over a branch, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the pollen's down at the toes when
you're starting, when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: creating the bag, you're making it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you put the sock on the,
the branch, so to speak, the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes the top and you just cinch it with
a zap strap or an elastic bag or a tie or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'd still want to, you'd still want
to like jostle the bag occasionally to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of re remove the pollen around,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more chances at the pollinate
after the very first attempt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, it's probably not necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you're, you'd be surprised
how many pollens fit, how many pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: grains fit into a, you know, for example,
a teaspoon of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were to create one of these bags
and put a teaspoon of pollen in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a more than enough pollen to
saturate the entire branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great picture of these actually
on rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Clark's book, Marijuana Botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, anybody can find that picture
online from the front cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then one of the four corners, there's a,
a picture of a, a cannabis plant with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, four or five different branches
on it with the pollen bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we follow this strategy of using
STS, this silver thiosulfate, what are our
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages of success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like what's the likelihood of there
being a male seed produced in this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's less than a hundred
percent, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the true answer to that Shanga is,
is that we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I would argue that 99.99% of the
seeds that are produced from these
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations are going to be genetic and
phenotypically female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we all know that there's anomalies in
gender expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big topic about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether men or men and women or men or
whatever, but there's definitely a small
[SPEAKER_03]: subset of the population where the
genetics just don't match the phenotype
[SPEAKER_03]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and those things can, but yeah,
they probably can happen, but I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's much more likely when you find a male
seed in the, in a female, but an all
[SPEAKER_03]: female seed lot or a gynecologist or
feminized seed seed lot, it's more likely
[SPEAKER_03]: that that male is derived from a pollen
contamination event back when the seed was
[SPEAKER_03]: making seeds or the plant was making seeds
rather than a female, um, female breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: resulting in a male seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there is some good insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're in the scene, you know,
how often, um, I mean, it's not like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly often, but it happens often
enough that somebody plants a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a feminized seed and they get a male and
they totally lose their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ends up being blamed on the,
you know, feminized seeds at a hole when
[SPEAKER_01]: really it's probably an accidental pollen
part, a pollen particle that, that
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminated, you know, in the breeding
room, it's, it's much more likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, and like I said,
there, there are anomalies everywhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: the, in, in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in, I was in Morocco with Rob Clark
a few years ago, and we were walking
[SPEAKER_03]: through these fields with thousands of
plants in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found a plant that had male,
female, it had male flowers, but for every
[SPEAKER_03]: other discernible characteristic,
this plant could have been a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it, it was what we would,
what we called a very female male,
[SPEAKER_03]: or it was a heavily female trait male
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are some subtle differences
between males and females.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for example, often, and this is
not, it doesn't always hold true,
[SPEAKER_03]: but often when plants go into,
if you grow regular seeds at Daiisha seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and you put them in a flowering,
often the males will, um, they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they become taller right before you go
into flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can think of that like an
evolutionary trait, kind of like corn,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, corn, the tassel that drops the
pollen is at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that pollen falls, it's falling
towards the female reproductive organs
[SPEAKER_03]: below.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so what cannabis does is it,
it shoots up maybe an extra foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that the male flowers are
physically above their female counterpart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they open the male flowers and
the pollen falls down and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's caught by the wind, but it's still
blowing slightly downward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an evolutionary advantage for the
males to be slightly taller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and also that stretchiness that
allows the male to stretch out and become
[SPEAKER_03]: taller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the same aspect happens to the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a tight floral cluster really
becomes much more loose and open with male
[SPEAKER_03]: plants than the female counterparts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that allows the, the male,
they kind of look like little grapes when
[SPEAKER_03]: they come out of a male, when they come
out of a, the, their pre flower state and
[SPEAKER_03]: they drop and open and that, that loose,
it's called like a panicle and that loose
[SPEAKER_03]: floral structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of gives freedom for the feet or
for the male plants to swing around and be
[SPEAKER_03]: captured by the, the wind, which jostles
them and releases the pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you spray STS on a female plant,
you'll notice that the plants don't look
[SPEAKER_03]: like they, like, even though they're male
flowers rather than female flowers on the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, the rest of the stature is quite
stocky and short and unlike a natural
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have to, you might have to
break up the female or the male flowers by
[SPEAKER_03]: hand, for example, and to release the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a much better understanding of
how to use silver thiosulfate to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: make the feminine seeds and what my
strategy would look like before we start
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about accidental stress causing a
female plant to produce male flowers that
[SPEAKER_01]: have pollen in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people have told me that,
oh, there's, there's lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to make feminine seeds, but what,
you know, in my research, I pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: find there be, there is silver thiosulfate
and then a bunch of rumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so is there another scientifically
reliable method to create feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: other than using STS?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are other hormone blockers.
[SPEAKER_03]: STS works the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what you're really referencing is
there's a couple of techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was called rotalization,
which is really not a good technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dutch Passion, who first
commercialized the feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: also used a pretty suspect technique when
creating the first feminized seeds that
[SPEAKER_03]: really led to feminized seeds having a bad
reputation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember before I said like begets
like, and all that means is that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: take a plant and it has any given set of
traits, those, those traits are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be likely to be represented in the
offspring or more likely to be represented
[SPEAKER_03]: in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the way that the initial companies
made these feminized seeds is they took
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that would say normally flower in
eight to 10 weeks and they flowered those
[SPEAKER_03]: for 12 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when plants get way past sexual
maturity, some of them will start
[SPEAKER_03]: producing male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, those male flowers,
obviously you can harvest that pollen and
[SPEAKER_03]: then also use that pollen to create new
female seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, is that those plants
were, you know, some people would call
[SPEAKER_03]: them unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I call them intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember at the beginning of the
episode, we talked about daeciousness
[SPEAKER_03]: versus moniesiousness, where you either
have plants that have separate sexes on
[SPEAKER_03]: separate plants, or we have the other end
of the spectrum as both sexes on one
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would think of that like a,
like a spectrum or a continuum where that
[SPEAKER_03]: one end we have complete intersexuality or
moniesious plants like hemp that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they, they produce many,
many male and many, many female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't matter because we,
you know, with hemp, we want it to be
[SPEAKER_03]: seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they're harvesting the seeds to be
sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that trait in a drug cannabis plant is
really not a good characteristic because
[SPEAKER_03]: you can have a plant spontaneously produce
male flowers and pollinate the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, or at least that region of your
greenhouse or grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really obviously devalues the,
the selling price of the cannabis if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: full of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what these Dutch companies are
predominantly Dutch companies did is they
[SPEAKER_03]: used plants that would naturally produce,
this is this, keep in mind, this is before
[SPEAKER_03]: people realized that you could use silver
thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these plant breeders would harvest
the pollen from these intersex plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: use that to fertilize their females or to
pollinate their females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those plants would then inherit that
intersex or hermaphrodite characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first feminized seeds that were
available on the market, we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: reports of, of, you know, Hermes or more
appropriately intersex plants in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the, in the seed lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's one of the real
reasons that feminized seeds kind of have
[SPEAKER_03]: a bad reputation on the market is because
those early lessons, they left a deep
[SPEAKER_03]: impression in the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is when you're taking a
plant and you're selfing it, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: reinforcing any characteristic that is it
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're, if your chosen mother plant
has a slight tendency to be intersex or to
[SPEAKER_03]: go intersex, you know, on a, on a given
set of stresses, pH light cycle,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what, whatever it is,
those stresses are likely to create a
[SPEAKER_03]: trigger, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To, to induce those male flowers to
appear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really don't want to use when
you're, when you're selfing a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't want to reinforce that type of
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is so interesting because this
actually answers my next question I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go to, because as, as we know,
some cultivars, when you put them under
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, they will throw male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that for most of us,
that's a negative happenstance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want our female plants to throw
male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then, but then some people are
like, oh, sweet, you know, I w I was
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping to get these flowers to,
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but now they're feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they've got this different value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to ask you, are those
feminized seeds, you know, equally as
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable as the kind that we make using,
uh, STS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the answer would be no is
because they're much less valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: much less stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to, they're going to
include that likelihood that they will,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, her me or go intersex on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets any kind of stress,
maybe not even a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, again, I think the argument
could be made that for a plant reader,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe using an STS technique or,
or that type of pollination technique is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually a good way to remove the intersex
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you, you know, if you took a
plant that had slight intersex tendencies
[SPEAKER_03]: and you selfed it and you grew the next
generation, any of the plants in the next
[SPEAKER_03]: generation that don't have that tendency,
you know, it's possible that those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: have, have removed that given trait from
the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, again, in plant breeding,
there's no hard and set rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you definitely don't want to be
releasing seeds like that onto the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace where a grower is then going
to grow them expecting that they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be a hundred percent female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's one of the challenges
too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the seed market as it is right now,
it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people to make money selling seeds
that, you know, you get folks that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they take their, their, their,
you know, favorite strain and they hit it
[SPEAKER_01]: to a bunch of hype strains and then they
put the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, more of the breeders
that I respect, they're actually going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work that seed group to, to, you know,
stress them and pull those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those traits are less likely to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's probably the real big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between, you know, pollen chuckers and,
and people who I give like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the, the capital B breeder
to is whether or not they put that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: effort in to really stabilize it and pull
out a lot of those unwanted traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and that's, you know, that's just
something that again, because of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, plant breeding is typically done
by nerds and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not really a celebrity
seeking kind of job, but it's for some
[SPEAKER_03]: reason in cannabis, it is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that's kind of a weird little
commentary on, on the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, in, in the real plant
breeding world, as much as 75% or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: even 90% of the crosses that you make
don't aren't, they're not successes,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they're not the, the ideal with plant
breeding really in my mind should be,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I guess there's different goals in
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, one goal might be to
replicate the breeder's idiot type or the
[SPEAKER_03]: ideal expression or the breeder's opinion
of what that ideal expression is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to capture that in the seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's different, you know,
you might have an ideal plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I don't know, let's just choose one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the girls get cookies, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super, it's a variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's really high THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lovely flavor profile,
but it's not very big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might want to breed that plant to
produce about twice as much as it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that takes time and effort and a
lot of crosses and experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, 90% of those,
uh, those, those breeding experiments are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be dead ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to lead to that next
generation or what we would call an elite
[SPEAKER_03]: plant where, you know, you're,
you're raising the quality to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the, to the producer, not only the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it produces more, it's more mold
resistant, whatever, whatever the fix is
[SPEAKER_03]: for that particular line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go to our first commercial
break, I want to go on a quick little
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing expedition with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so at, uh, last Emerald Cup,
um, I was, uh, I was hanging out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dragon fly earth medicine tent and they
were talking about how, um, on their farm
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Canada, they make, they have some
plants that produce female only seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without STS because they were saying at
the time that they're, they're not fans of
[SPEAKER_01]: using that chemical, uh, for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I'm all like, so, so how do you
have female seeds naturally coming off a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that their best guess is
that, um, they heavily green mulch with
[SPEAKER_01]: nettle, um, which is high in hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that when this plant breaks down and
it gets watered in, um, that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the very least the lower branches,
um, uh, self pollinate, I guess is the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and then the plant produces only
female, um, seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious to know, does this,
does this hit any triggers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I, and I want to apologize
in advance to Dr. Dragonfly, if I,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I screwed up their story, um,
because maybe, maybe they don't produce
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the seeds just come out as female,
but, but I guess the point I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask about is, is there a way that adding
hormones to the root structure should,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to change the, the gender of the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're great, really super nice
people, but as a scientist, I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that does trigger me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I don't think that that's,
I don't think that's likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's, we, we have listened
in the, in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have this, um, long history of
speculating and coming up with really
[SPEAKER_03]: lavish ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, people were driving
stakes through the stems of plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff 30 years ago to try and increase the
resin content.
[SPEAKER_03]: We humans have done all sorts of crazy
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I, I think that scientifically,
there'd be, there's a pretty big gap
[SPEAKER_03]: between saying if we put these hormones on
the root system, they get absorbed by the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and they only have an effect within,
you know, however far of the, of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that, that's too bad, Ryan,
you know, because I really liked the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of us being able to make feminized seeds
in a more, you know, natural way than
[SPEAKER_01]: using the chemical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I'm disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that we do that is,
is like I said, the way those early Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: seed producers, the ruralization style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's hemp lines that also produce that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, there's a, a hemp breeder who's
now passed, but it was a Hungarian hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder named Ivan Boschka.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came up with what he called a
unisex line, um, that produced nearly all
[SPEAKER_03]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking, you know, 9,
990 out of a thousand kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he had this method for going and
selecting intersex plants, but only the
[SPEAKER_03]: very right intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he had a subset of plants that,
that he chose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you use those plants to breed
with regular female plants, they were,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they were, you know, air quote gyno,
gynoecious seeds are all female seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't all female seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were feminized seeds with a small
percentage of intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you can do that stuff naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I don't think that we need
to be scared of chemicals like a silver
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we, we feed all sorts of nitrates
to our plants as food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just silver and nitrogen and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I, you know, I think if you're
careful with it and you don't spray it on
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself, there's really very,
very, very minimal risk associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think it's more of a lifestyle
choice to say, Hey, we're going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not going to use chemicals like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, that the, the trade-off if
we're truly looking for plants that are
[SPEAKER_03]: sexually stable and aren't going to throw
intersex plants, we're better to rely on
[SPEAKER_03]: the chemicals rather than going and
selecting four plants that are likely to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce pollen under any given number of
triggers, be it low light conditions or
[SPEAKER_03]: like we said before, pH or certain feeding
regimens.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I would not, I would not do it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, I want to push one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the, on the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this, is it, is this, does,
uh, this occur in nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it a, is it an, a manmade
chemical or, or are we just taking
[SPEAKER_01]: something in nature and applying it to the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what I'm getting at is I'm trying to
understand for myself, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly it's not something as
far out as like genetically modified
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, we're not doing, you know,
like, you know, genetic line changes or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're at, we're, we're pushing the
plant to, to do something with a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: and many chemicals are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to decide how unnatural,
if you will, using STS is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this, is this bastardization of nature
or, or is this just a, a cool natural
[SPEAKER_01]: trick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's a bastardization of
nature, but also keep in mind that I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I am pro responsible use of
genetic modifications because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: technology's hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've heard me say this before at the
Emerald cup, but you know, technologies
[SPEAKER_03]: like tailing and CRISPR are going to
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they, they are changing the face of
plant breeding and allowing us to do
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we could never have done in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in terms of our gynoecious
seeds, natural, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there, there's no all female
seeds in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's money we should seeds,
which are, I think it's important to say
[SPEAKER_03]: again here, monogamous seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really all female seeds,
but that have an intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at them genetically,
they don't have Y chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're heavily intersects plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So technically, you know, on a genetic
level, they're, they are female plants or
[SPEAKER_03]: all female plants, but they're all female
and intersex, which makes them
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypically monicious, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if, if you want to be hippie
minded and only doing things that are
[SPEAKER_03]: found without the help of man,
feminized seeds are not for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super grateful to Kelly for,
you know, suggesting this possibility in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent so that I could go down this
path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hell, here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like a year later and I'm still,
I'm still talking about it because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: such an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've had a super long first set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and, and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is cannabis biologist,
Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows high
[SPEAKER_01]: yielding, healthy plants without using
excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail in
[SPEAKER_01]: no time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is IP 66 wet rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_01]: want for great yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look bad-ass too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to judge on power photon
efficiency and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior power
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy and a comfortable visual
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to check out their website

[SPEAKER_01]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_01]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_01]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_01]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert so
it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_01]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shagolos, and our guest
this week is cannabis biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the second set, we're gonna talk a
lot more about feminized seed myths and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out which ones might hold some
water and which ones are just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, holdovers from the early days of
feminized seeds when they were made with
[SPEAKER_01]: rotolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ryan, we talked a little bit already
about how poorly tested seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly tested feminized seeds can,
you know, go intersex when put under
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really high-end,
I'm not even really high-end, like
[SPEAKER_01]: properly made feminized seeds don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess my question for you is if
the goal when making feminized seeds is
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are not going to be males and
that they will not be throwing male
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical parts, what can we do when
producing feminized seeds so that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, we have to cop to the
fact that sometimes that does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we see the pictures on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea to say, yeah, that's an
untested plant, that's a good position to
[SPEAKER_01]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what's that testing look like so
that you're not making feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that crack under stress?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there's all these conditions
under which even regular cannabis females
[SPEAKER_03]: that are created through regular matings
with males and females, they also throw
[SPEAKER_03]: what we call intersex characteristics or,
you know, they're colloquially known as
[SPEAKER_03]: hermes, which is really not a very good
description for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these intersex plants, they pop up
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a factor of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's present to a degree or less in
different cultivars and different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically, what you do is if you expect
the plant is going to undergo this stress
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype of intersexuality, you expose it
to those conditions that might trigger
[SPEAKER_03]: that intersexuality to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you flick the lights in the
middle of the night and give them periods
[SPEAKER_03]: of interrupt or you essentially interrupt
their dark period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can sometimes cause stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some plants will become intersex
and some plants won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the ones that become intersex,
they're probably not good breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: candidates because they're going to be
triggered by, you know, light
[SPEAKER_03]: interruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants that are resistant to becoming
intersex in that condition, they might be
[SPEAKER_03]: a better candidate to be part of a
female-female breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so same goes for, you know,
temperature fluctuations or pH
[SPEAKER_03]: fluctuations in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these stresses that might
trigger, again, we look for the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that are triggered and we select against
those plants using the principle of like
[SPEAKER_03]: begets like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anything that has that trigger,
we want to remove those plants from our
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding population so that those traits
aren't passed on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that any really any plant that
is made to be part of a female breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: program or itself that those seeds should
be examined before they're sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they should be grown out by the
breeder and confirm that they don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things that we do when
we especially when we use self seeds is
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not just giving, you know,
when you use a regular breeding program,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you take a plant that might have a an
iffy characteristic, it's 50-50 whether
[SPEAKER_03]: that characteristic is going to get passed
on because it's, you know, there's there's
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen, there's genetic country
contributions coming from another
[SPEAKER_03]: individual, which is also going to
influence the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're selfing seeds or you're
selfing plants, those resulting seed
[SPEAKER_03]: lines, they kind of get a double dose of
whatever good or whatever bad traits the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant might hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we really have to go through and do
a subsequent screen and make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant isn't passing on bad
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing your breeding programs,
what do you choose to do to the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: stress them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's funny to hear people
joke on Instagram about the the crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: obstacles and torture they put their
plants under to try to weed out the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, you've mentioned interruption
of light cycle and temperature swings in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that, what other,
you know, trials would you put plants
[SPEAKER_01]: through to make sure that when they're
under stress, they're not going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, just normal grow room
stresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is, is that, you know,
I try to I try to create an environment
[SPEAKER_03]: that the plants are going to grow in for
the breeding, you really want to select
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants under the same environments
that they're going to be growing in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, you can torture plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I expect that there's a certain degree
of torture that plants do go through being
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in home gardens by inexperienced
growers and growers in little tents and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, I mean, I guess you can try to
build a bulletproof plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I just do selections in
greenhouses and expose them to the normal
[SPEAKER_03]: everyday stresses that they might get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a it's kind of a I don't
really don't torture test too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, our torture test is using the
plants in production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, I don't use plants,
unless it's for a very small breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: program that doesn't become a commercial
release, you know, something to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: like an obscure chemistry like THCB,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, a lot of the breeding becomes
focused on plants that are accepted in the
[SPEAKER_03]: market, accepted by the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to take the blue dreams and
the cookies of the world and the OG and
[SPEAKER_03]: make them better.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that all those plants,
you know, we go through this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion thing with with cannabis,
you know, one one plant that's fashionable
[SPEAKER_03]: one day, seven years down the road,
nobody wants to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if you wait another seven
years, it's like bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in addition to the, you know,
the belief that feminized seeds are more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to go intersex, another belief of
folks is that that feminized seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: less vigorous or produce plants that are
smaller in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have produced smaller
plants from feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also produced monster plants from
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've kind of put that more on me and
my inconsistent growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the scientific background,
are feminized seeds less vigorous or
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller in size than a true reg seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, they don't have to be because,
again, you could make an F-100 hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seed line by taking two stable,
true breeding females and crossing them
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the plant would be that that plant
would be an F-1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, those are typically
very high, very high in vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selfing, though, again, it we get a double
dose of any traits, any you have an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to get a double dose of any
traits that are in the parent plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so any plants that are for diminutive
stature, they kind of yeah, we do see and
[SPEAKER_03]: sell seeds that you have this wide range
of of plants that, you know, some that are
[SPEAKER_03]: very vigorous, some that might not be so
vigorous, some that are very small with
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny leaves and some that are normal
looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of the breeders goal is to
select for or against those traits,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on what the the end goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that has nothing to do with the actual
fact that they're female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like straight up breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's really maybe one
of the most important take homes that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can that people can have coming out of
this conversation is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people started selfing seeds,
they would take these plants and they'd
[SPEAKER_03]: spray them with STS and then they would
grow the resulting S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe 50 percent of the plants were
smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty percent of the plants were intersex,
like we were saying before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the assumption is,
oh, well, I use this new breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably what caused the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the truth is, is that that the
breeding technique exposed a genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: weakness that was unseen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to be able to tease apart the
cause of the the cause and effect of the
[SPEAKER_03]: consequences that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, was it really the STS that we
sprayed on the plant that made the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in the next generation subpar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it was that those plants that
were generated, they just inherited
[SPEAKER_03]: inherited some subpar genetics that were
buried in the plant, which is not only
[SPEAKER_03]: possible that's, in fact, what we expect
from selfing out-crossing species like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways, it can be seen as an
attractive attribute, because if you are a
[SPEAKER_01]: serious breeder and you really want to
pull all of these less than attractive
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes out, well, you know,
creating feminine seeds and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: see all of the stuff, that's actually a
win if you don't want to put out stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with these attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hidden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might be a condition that,
you know, for example, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some plants that if you cross a
white flower with a with a red flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a pink flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you try to breed that pink
flower, the next generation produces
[SPEAKER_03]: twenty five percent white flowers,
twenty five percent red flowers and fifty
[SPEAKER_03]: percent pink flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the if you want to have all
of the flowers come out pink, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: cross the the red and the white types
together to get pink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you might not like the red or the
white types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they become a means to an end,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these traits that we see as
favorable in elite cannabis plants are as
[SPEAKER_03]: a result of what we call heterosis,
which is a condition where the plant has
[SPEAKER_03]: two separate chromosomes from from diverse
and disparate parents that are very
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically unreliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you kind of have to go to the ugly
before you can breed the beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one is one is a means to the
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of exist in a balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have one without the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like dying to be a meme,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go with the ugly before you
can breed the beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these cross analogies that we
can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you start talking about breeding
humans, people get upset about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, well, let's just let's move
right on from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to hit on something before
we go to the next potential myth to bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you came up to the point where
you're talking about, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take the pink flowered plant and then
when you breed that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: only 25 percent of them or some percentage
are going to be the pink and then maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest are going to be white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know a lot about
breeding myself at the at a fine level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I you know, I have studied a little
bit of genetic trait charts and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have a book that you would
recommend to people who have not studied
[SPEAKER_01]: this at the university level, who are just
like regular cannabis folk like I am?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a good read that would would
explain like the next level of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without burying me in scientific
jargon that I may not have the education
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's an old one and it's not
very advanced techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really discuss suffering or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rob Clark's book on marijuana botany
is a propagation of distinctive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana botany is just an incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a classic, you know, you can't even
even though some parts of it are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: dated, it's still like worth every for
everybody to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, the only other one from the
cannabis industry that I would really
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend is as Jorge Cervantes,
marijuana horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a green book and I think they
called it the the medical growers Bible or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually wrote the breeding chapter for
that back in 2004 or 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to lay it out in a very simple
goal oriented way of breeding that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was I had hoped that it was
easy for the consumer to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little different than most
most breeding segments in these cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: books had been presented in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be one worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as far as anything else and
really trying to understand the the
[SPEAKER_03]: meiosis and the genetic dance that goes on
behind that's really the foundation of all
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding, you know, plant breeding
for dummies or genetics for dummies,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that is would be really
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're, you know, 10, 15 bucks
online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure people could find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they give you a nice broad base.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be cannabis specific,
but you're going to learn a lot from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you'd learn more than you
would from learning, learning from a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis book, to be perfectly honest,
more principles that really lay the
[SPEAKER_03]: foundation of the science of like you were
talking about Punnett squares and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really gives you a visualization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually maybe maybe read the the
breeding for dummies version of the book
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go read Rob's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got you already have a basket of
knowledge with which to read Rob's book
[SPEAKER_01]: when I I was very early in, you know,
in my cannabis life when I read Rob's
[SPEAKER_01]: book, and it was like over my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably actually do way better if
I read it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you went back and read it now,
you'd get a lot of that out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has to remember to that was that
book was written almost 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's 1981.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was published.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not it's not going to be all full
of stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: of OG and blue dream or cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does really a beautiful job of
talking about all the different land race
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets into some basic trait
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just across my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like 81.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wow, that knowledge is as old as
when I was listening to Van Halen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long ass time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the next belief about femseeds I
want to hit is, you know, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: will say that feminine seeds may be great
to grow for your own pleasure for your
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke or for your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's certainly great for patients
because they don't have to deal with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, male plants because there's
nothing quite as sad as a patient that's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you know, six plants for,
you know, themselves medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they end up with four males.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so sad because not only are
patients usually really emotionally
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to each plant, but that really
decreases the amount of medicine you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got for your year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but a lot of people say that using
feminine seeds to breed is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we've been talking a lot about
cookies, let's say like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you get some Girl Scout cookies,
feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody would say, yeah, if you want to
breed with cookies, you need to go and
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino hunt, you know, some cookies seeds
that are regular or get yourself a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and breed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to breed with the feminized
seed because there is something at its
[SPEAKER_01]: very low basis that is, you know,
more easily corruptible than using regular
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that that's nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, we try to look at
it scientifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you look back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that for me, if a plant is good
enough to use as a female breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: like if the plant is good enough for me as
a breeder to say, okay, this plant is is
[SPEAKER_03]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it doesn't have intersex offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have go intersex when the
lights get flipped on at night or the pH
[SPEAKER_03]: of the soil is too low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confident that this plant is a
reliable solid breeding candidate.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that plant is good enough to
either be a pollen donor or a pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: recipient.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that a lot of people in the
scene believe that the STS creates some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of chromosomal instability.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I heard a plant breeder say that
at the Emerald Cup last year, and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: just no evidence that that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, theoretically, I guess it's
possible that somehow the silver damages
[SPEAKER_03]: the DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's never been any kind of
scientific confirmation that that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to remember that these
techniques are used widely in other crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like all your cucumbers are pretty
much feminized or got gynoecious lots as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, because it's not efficient for
farmers to be growing acres and acres of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants when 25 percent of the plants are
are male and they're not going to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: cucumbers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a huge waste of time and
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're if you're a grower,
if you're a grower, you want them to be
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to fill your plot with everything
that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that we've you know,
I don't think that people haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: able to tease apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's like we said before,
how much of the damage, how much of the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem are we seeing as a result of a bad
selection of a parental plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Versus the breeding technique that was
used to create that the the generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, I just don't believe I haven't
seen enough detriment across the board to
[SPEAKER_03]: say, yes, I think that this is a result of
the technique and not the plants that were
[SPEAKER_03]: chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you can attribute all the
negative consequences of selfing from
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic weaknesses that are contained
within the plants themselves that were
[SPEAKER_03]: selfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last question before we go to our
second break, you know, I know this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be kind of a vague question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to need you to work with me
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to ask you it because I see it
so commonly just kind of thrown out there
[SPEAKER_01]: on cannabis forums by people who are
hating on feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will say some version of you
shouldn't use feminine seeds because
[SPEAKER_01]: growing or breeding with feminine seeds
limits the size of the overall cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's bad for the future of cannabis as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a funny statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a there is a bit of a truth
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say there's truth with it
pertaining to feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has to remember any seed or any
child can only have two parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the the the act of taking two plants
and putting them together or taking a
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand males or a thousand females and
putting them together, they both result in
[SPEAKER_03]: the same consequence that every seed came
from two parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're taking two female plants and
mating them together or you're taking one
[SPEAKER_03]: female plant and one male plant and mating
them together, you're still doing what I
[SPEAKER_03]: call a one to one mating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yes, one to one matings create a
genetic bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're narrowing the genetic possibilities
that are being passed on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes as a plant breeder, you need to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you do need to purge it when
you're when you're trying to create
[SPEAKER_03]: something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to remove all the traits that you
don't want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes the way you do that is by
creating a tight bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always take that bottleneck
population and backcross it to the more
[SPEAKER_03]: diverse family.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think trying to assign the blame of
genetic bottlenecking to feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: really isn't accurate because that's what
plant breeders, cannabis plant breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: have been doing since dawn immoral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, essentially, that's that's the
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're trying to create consistency in
our seeds so that when you plant the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the plant you're ideally looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually what happens with then
regular seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a honing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's like sculpture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's removing the parts you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if everybody did that with all of
cannabis at the same time, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, that that may limit the gene
pool theoretically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since that's not actually what happens
and we can always outcross the the
[SPEAKER_01]: realistic experience we have is not
actually a decrease in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just I don't think I mean,
I do think that we do need to be careful
[SPEAKER_03]: with genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: All crops are going through this massive
narrowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think attributing that problem
solely to something with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: is a bit of a false dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our last short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is cannabis biologist Ryan
Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: In times like these, when so many
different farming techniques and sunshine
[SPEAKER_01]: to cultivate cannabis flowers for you,
California has produced the best cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that massively scaled
industrial cannabis production could
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the same quality as small batch
lovingly cultivated flowers is just silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush South Fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_01]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals grows under bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature and nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The result is big, beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: that tastes like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_01]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: Redwood Healing and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you choose Saint's Joints,
you are smoking all flower top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_01]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's Joints has focused on their line
of exotic curated joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saint's Joints goes deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Searching out hard to find strains,
unexpected crosses and nearly forgotten
[SPEAKER_01]: land races and classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some hype ones too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does a joint from Saint's smoke
incredibly well, they have fine tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The joint is just the right density to
have a nice pull and the joint stays lit
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you get a bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's Joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_01]: out at a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's award-winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art
[SPEAKER_01]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_01]: homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask your budtender for Saint's Joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Saint's Joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow exceptional cannabis flower
but are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_01]: cost and risk of launching your own brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Saint's Joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already established in California,
Washington and Oklahoma and recognized by
[SPEAKER_01]: Entrepreneur Magazine and Green
Entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: leader, the Saint's Joints brand will set
you apart in your home market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram page at Saint's
[SPEAKER_01]: Joints and look at their patented drawer
design boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Instagram at Saint's Joints
and then visit saintsjoints.com to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioflux Fermented Plant Boost from
Everflux simplifies organic farming so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can start growing organically today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invented by a California farmer growing
organic for 40 years, Bioflux is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented natural farming preparation for
those who want a natural micro booster
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This extraordinary chemical free growth
and terpene enhancer improves root
[SPEAKER_01]: development, accelerates the conversion of
organic matter into humus, increases
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient use efficiency and uptake,
and increases beneficial microbe activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the Bioflux Fermented Plant
Booster, Everflux also makes an activated
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar called teraflux that is infused
with the Bioflux Plant Booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine combining the buffering and
rhizosphere enhancing qualities of biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: infused with a range of earthworm
castings, insect frass, kelp and crab
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, oyster shell and other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using teraflux infused biochar this
summer myself and it smells alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich and potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: These products have been scientifically
proven to match yields and increase flower
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and pest resistance when compared
to traditional NPK inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are looking for reliable organic
fertilizers that will free you up to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on other aspects of your garden,
consider using the range of all natural
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative fertilizers and natural bio
stimulants from Everflux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out more at EverfluxTechnologies.com
or by following their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Everflux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, you are listening to Shaping
Fire, I'm your host, Shango Los and our
[SPEAKER_01]: guest this week is cannabis biologist,
Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ryan, in this third set, I am hoping
that you can take us all down this path of
[SPEAKER_01]: female only breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I do not know a lot about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have two friends that practice
female only breeding, but my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: are they like excited about it and they
really find it as like kind of like being
[SPEAKER_01]: way more immediate and successful more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured since we're doing a show all
about female seeds and the producing of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, the breeding with them, let's go
ahead and talk about female breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of bring everybody up to the state of
the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you start generally with just
what is female only breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: So really it's exactly what it sounds
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's breeding without using any male
plants and it's a breeding tool or
[SPEAKER_03]: technique that is really incredibly well
suited to breeding specifically for drug
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're breeding, because drug
cannabis is the experience is so based on
[SPEAKER_03]: the chemistry of the plant, really what
we're doing is trying to create a special
[SPEAKER_03]: chemistry both in the cannabinoids and the
terpenes and terpenoids and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: other chemicals of the plant produces to
create a user experience or a plant with a
[SPEAKER_03]: user experience that we find enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we use traditional breeding
techniques where we use a male cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and a female cannabis plant,
it's really easy to choose the female
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant because we can use a
laboratory or we can use our nose or the
[SPEAKER_03]: way that the smoke flowers make us feel as
a guide to which individual female plant
[SPEAKER_03]: is the best or better than all the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we can't do that with male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't smoke the female,
you don't smoke the flowers of the male
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male plants really don't produce a
smokable flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they don't produce a flower
that produces a lot of resin glands,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't really use the same laboratory
techniques that we use in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I suppose we could, but it would
only give you a little bit of a hint as
[SPEAKER_03]: what the plant would look like if it was a
female plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if we choose female plants based
on their bud and their flower
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics, we can kind of do what I
call positive selection on both sides of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can find a pollen donor plant that has
traits of interest and we can have a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: mother plant that has maybe the same
traits of interest or different traits of
[SPEAKER_03]: interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way we're doing positive
selection on both sides of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if we were trying to breed a male
with a female, we could understand
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that that plant genetically
contributes to the female flower on the
[SPEAKER_03]: female side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the male side, we're kind of
shooting in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm picturing in my head is I'm
going to take one female plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: spray her with STS to cause her to give
off male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to pollinate that to a
second female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so both of these female plants have
got traits that I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully the seeds from that
second female plant when I grow them will
[SPEAKER_01]: carry the phenotypes and the traits that I
want from both plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will secondarily choose from
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's more or less, we'll clean it
up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people are listening and they're
going to want to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're listening at home,
I always recommend that we treat our
[SPEAKER_03]: donors plants as if they're on about a
three to four week schedule ahead of your
[SPEAKER_03]: female target plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you always want to take your donor
plant and trigger it into 1212 or trigger
[SPEAKER_03]: into flower by putting it in darkness or
12 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the first day of doing that,
you spray the plant with STS, which
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes an application that I usually do
weekly until their third or fourth week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then wait two to three weeks for our
target plants until we move them into the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering chamber, because the STS,
it does slow the plant down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure why it does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there seems to be a delay or there's
no synchronicity in their flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: periods if you don't trigger the pollen
plants before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's really about it's really
about selecting plants on both sides that
[SPEAKER_03]: you find interesting and bringing them
together through this STS process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, as you said, Shango, you get you're
more quickly able to move towards your
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, you're doing positive
selection on both parents, not just the
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But secondly, every time you want to grow
out those populations that you're you're
[SPEAKER_03]: you're experimenting with your test
crosses, if you're using male female
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, 50% of those plants that you
have to spend, you know, time,
[SPEAKER_03]: energy, nutrients, water, soil,
taking care of and bringing them to
[SPEAKER_03]: maturity, only to find that their males is
really, it's kind of a drag.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, a real pain in the ass if you're
trying to do it on any any type of scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, when you're using all female
breeding, again, one of the benefits is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're that you're receiving
gynoecious seeds out of the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, every seed that you plant
is going to be a potential breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: candidate or a winner, you know,
a plant that you can look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just taking up space until you
feel you find out that it's a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's one real benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the the benefit of being able
to really look at the chemistry of both
[SPEAKER_03]: plants before you bring them together is
is a huge, a huge boon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in our in our work at
Napro, we really we showed that that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: really fast way to to make progress when
you're breeding for specific chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I do like the process of
choosing male plants, compared to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: using a female plant that is directly
displaying the traits that I want,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes talking about tight internodal
spacing and rubbing the stem of a of a
[SPEAKER_01]: male plant to guess what the terpene
profile would be like, it makes it seem
[SPEAKER_01]: like caveman, like pure prehistoric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it really is it is really caveman
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when I when I do that type
of breeding, and it's not to say that I
[SPEAKER_03]: never use males in breeding projects,
but typically when I do use males,
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't use a single male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll collect pollen from, you know,
10 to 15 plants or maybe more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you only select, say, 10 to 15 percent
of the of the plants that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're really looking at at a whole
set of characteristics, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance to molds and mildews and that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that, you know, like you said,
the leaf shape and the the inner node
[SPEAKER_03]: distance and the floral structure,
you can kind of get an idea of what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at and use that as a loose
criteria to select away 80 percent of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still use the remaining 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll collect them all and mix all their
pollen together, because like like we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about earlier, that provides some
level of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're really trying to get,
you know, tight down and dirty with one
[SPEAKER_03]: specific chemo type or one specific smell
profile, it's a lot easier to take two
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that already have that smell
profile, you know, either as determined by
[SPEAKER_03]: the lab or by your nose and using those
plants to mate together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see that the end results are
vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You much more quickly approach your goal
if you're using females on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally see how positive selection,
right, choosing the traits I want in the
[SPEAKER_01]: two females to get there more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes total sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there's a whole bunch of
folks out there who are going,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, no, man, like I absolutely need to use
a male or it's just not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to science that up a little
bit, you know, is there anything lost by
[SPEAKER_01]: not using a male?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a white chromosome that's lost and
it's not lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we can preserve white chromosomes
in a handful of seeds in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, you know, 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like we're in any fear of
actually losing the existence of the wild
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is, is even when we're
growing those regular seed lots or what we
[SPEAKER_03]: call regular seed lots, those male plants
don't fall into our marijuana production,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't into the production of cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Males are essentially irrelevant to that
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you know, cannabis has in its
genome, cannabis has 10 chromosome pairs,
[SPEAKER_03]: nine pairs of autosomes and one pair of
sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're using, you know,
when we're really what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're breeding is we're just shuffling
copies of those 10 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we again, when we look at
marijuana production, we're only concerned
[SPEAKER_03]: with the variation present on the nine
chromosomes and what's on the X
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome, because what's on the Y
chromosome is really kind of irrelevant
[SPEAKER_03]: for a drug cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is something called crossing over in
which Y chromosomes and X chromosomes
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange these little pieces of DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something on the male
chromosome called the pseudo autosomal
[SPEAKER_03]: region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that means is that there's part of
the Y chromosome that actually does
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange genetic information with the Y or
with the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think that we're truly
eliminating anything of value to drug
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis growers by creating feminized
seeds without Y chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you a question about
about sourcing STS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we move on off of this,
I'm going to I guess we'll call this
[SPEAKER_01]: another fishing expedition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I have people on this show
that have got a level of technical
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge that I may not know,
I like to ask this question, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: am I not asking you about female only
breeding that people want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really only you know,
I'm learning about it as you're telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and so but you you are very
experienced with it and and you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to get people excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so what else is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What what what is another female only
breeding data point or something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think is important and relevant that
people would want to know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we've touched on most of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the important things to realize is
that the two real take homes that I really
[SPEAKER_03]: want people to to think about are what
blame are we putting on the process of STS
[SPEAKER_03]: that really should be seen as blame of bad
selection of plants or plants that had
[SPEAKER_03]: negative traits?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I think the community really
assumes that the process of creating
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seeds does something to the
genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really hasn't been shown in any
type of research anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, I think that as
breeders, we need to do a better job of
[SPEAKER_03]: testing the seeds and being open about the
techniques that were used to produce the
[SPEAKER_03]: products that people are buying and give
the consumers as much information as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have to educate the consumers
so they know how to deal with that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's you know, it's enough to
say, hey, we have these or S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't know what an S1 seed is,
I don't think that that information is
[SPEAKER_03]: really too, too helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so you know, there's chances are
that there's a lot of people who are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be all hot to get some silver
thiosulfate now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and for me, if I were to do a breeding
program like this, I'd probably just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, call up Matt Riot and buy a
bottle of his, you know, feminizing spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is STS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I don't really know a lot about
this chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like like how do we know about
the veracity of the STS that we're using?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do they do they sell it at at,
you know, scientific supplies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we need to find somebody in the
cannabis scene that has, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: made a batch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's the nature of this chemical
and getting it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically when you're buying it,
you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to mix your own,
there's recipes for it online and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: all sites or all sorts of different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Types of recipes for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's typically two components that you
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver nitrate, which is a crystalline
chemical you can buy for about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's about twenty twenty
five dollars for a gram or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then there's sodium thiosulfate,
which comes in two forms, which
[SPEAKER_03]: complicates the recipe because there's
sodium pentahy, sodium thiosulfate,
[SPEAKER_03]: pentahydrate, which is essentially as
water molecules built into the crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can get it without.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the molecular weights are slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to know which one you're
working with if you if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: mix your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, what is done is you make you
measure out a given weight of each of the
[SPEAKER_03]: crystallized substances and you mix them
into a set amount of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those that now you have to stock
solution, which you then mix together and
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to pour one of them into the
other and not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, they react.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in a very negative way,
not a negative or dangerous way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the compounds don't come out as
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That all said, for most people that aren't
playing around with it, you're probably
[SPEAKER_03]: better off to just order it online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed there's a couple of outfits now
selling spray bottles on it on Amazon dot
[SPEAKER_03]: com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in the United States,
there's a company called Hybrid Tech who's
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant breeder friend of ours from Oregon
that is likes to be credited as the first
[SPEAKER_03]: person that kind of created the swell of
feminized seeds, even though he wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really the first person to create the the
product he did independently develop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's doing great work, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came up during the that same show I
referred to earlier with Caleb from CSI
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are they send best practices back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hybe is we've always known him as Hybe,
but he's a he's a really he's an educated
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeder and he really knows what
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he thinks about plant breeding as a
plant breeder, but not as if someone that
[SPEAKER_03]: is trying to make money off of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the bottom line is he sells it
and it's it's you know, it's probably more
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive than you need to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a ready to use formula that you
can just order.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes in the mail and a little
spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just spray that on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think if you don't know
how to mix lab chemicals, it's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: that that type of product is right up your
alley because it is STS is an oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's you don't want to be
breaking bottles and putting your hands in
[SPEAKER_03]: it or any of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stains really badly if you if you,
you know, knock it over on a wood table or
[SPEAKER_03]: a white table, for example, it's going to
get it's going to stain it for the for the
[SPEAKER_01]: especially nerdy folks who want to make
their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that there were different
types of recipes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a you know, a keyword that you
want to drop so that that people could use
[SPEAKER_01]: to find a recipe that that you find is
reliable?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you type sodium thiosulfate cannabis
into Google, you're going to find a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of recipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would mix it a little stronger than most
people are making it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just concentrate it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't put as much water in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you know, use gloves,
long sleeves, you know, goggles,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that kind of stuff when you're
spraying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just just use common sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you'll be able to find the
components online, usually from a
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes they sell them a photo
formularies like places for developing
[SPEAKER_03]: film like old camera film.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody remembers what that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: So earlier, when you were talking about
the breeding aspect, you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, you do you set the flower
or you set the plant to 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from from the day that you flip to
1212, you start spraying the plant once a
[SPEAKER_01]: week for the first five or six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I repeat that correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Four to five weeks, usually by that point
in time, it's dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or it's or the the the male flowers
are well towards development.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key there is that you want to you want
to have so I call I have two groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we call the target plants and the donor
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The donor plants are the plants that get
treated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that are going to become
the pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we put the pollen donors into
flower two to three weeks before we put
[SPEAKER_03]: the target plants in the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just gives those plants enough
time to get well into their male flower
[SPEAKER_03]: development period, so that by the time
that they're ready to open and release
[SPEAKER_03]: that pollen, your female plants are then
ready to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your your target plants are ready to
see pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that we leave like a two to three week
window in between, you know, when we
[SPEAKER_03]: induce the donor plants to flower and then
when we induce the target plants to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much STS do we spray on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those people who tends to think
more is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm since I've gotten involved in
learning Korean natural farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like teaching myself to not think more
is better all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but with this, can you can you just
give us some kind of rule of thumb of how
[SPEAKER_01]: much to spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do we we probably don't want it
damp, but we also probably need a uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's a little more coloring
with client crayons than doing intricate
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just kind of spray it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't necessarily encourage people to
spray it onto the actual leaves of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun leaves are you know, you could
they will absorb the chemical but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: this this chemical can be a little bit
phototoxic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they get exposed to subsequent
light, it can damage them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to spray what I call the crotches
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the junction where the leaf petiole or
the stem of the leaf meets the branch
[SPEAKER_03]: meets the either the branch or the main
stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that area is where the new flowers are
going to grow from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially anywhere that you think you
would see, you know, see a bud site on a
[SPEAKER_03]: female plant, spray that bud site,
or the tip of the of the shoot at that bud
[SPEAKER_03]: site, but don't necessarily worry about
the sun leaf itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more about spraying the ethylene
blocker on the area where those flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to produce rather than on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we hit that because in my head,
I was actually picturing a pre existing
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to start this at 1212,
you're not actually spraying it on
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, you are spraying it on future
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're you're really spread,
you're actually probably trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, spray branches at the at bud
sites, but before they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a little bit of experience to
know where those are going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it becomes obvious, you know,
after you after you plant the after you
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants have been in flowering for
about a week or 10 days, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: start to see little tufts of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point in time, yeah,
you switch to spraying the flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we want the whole point of the
action is for the ethylene to act at that
[SPEAKER_03]: flower site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to shut down the production of
female flowers, and in turn have the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: produce male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plant will still grow little buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea is that those little buds are
now made up of male flowers and not female
[SPEAKER_03]: clusters or colas, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ryan, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, I love cannabis in
general, but as somebody who talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: and and helps patients source female
seeds, and as somebody who grows feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, it's always been kind of a mystery
how these how these plants or how these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of went on faith,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel a lot more, I don't know,
empowered understanding what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to know that, you know,
it's not feminized seeds that that are
[SPEAKER_01]: often bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually poor growing, which actually
makes our to be poor selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes a lot more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so thanks for sharing your valuable
time and your experience and and breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: it down in such detail for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was absolutely my pleasure.
