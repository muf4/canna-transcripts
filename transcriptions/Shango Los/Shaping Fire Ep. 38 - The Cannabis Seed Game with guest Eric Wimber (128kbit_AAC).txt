[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding of cannabis seeds is elegant
and thoughtful and inspired, and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about that here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually doing the work to bring those
seeds to market can be brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you go through the work of carefully
crafting and breeding your seed stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: you still have to sort and quality check
thousands of seeds, design packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it manufactured, assemble the final
product, rock the social media to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out and inspire fans, reach out to stores
and online retailers to carry your seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: travel all across the country to attend
shows, pay extra for everything because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a cannabis company, and deal with
thieves and grifters and folks wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: test your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all before you've been paid
even a dime for any of your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of startup is hard, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a new cannabis seed startup is usually
a one-person job until the company grows
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to hire help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grueling hours, lots of travel,
and it requires an incredible amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: patience.

[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Eric Wimber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is founder, breeder and head of
operations of Dungeon's Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: His boutique cannabis seeds company is
sweeping the industry with a unique line
[SPEAKER_00]: of pungent and potent cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: His strains have won over 10 cannabis cups
in just the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, let's go ahead and start
right at the beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because part of what we want to talk about
today is the arc that somebody who wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to start a seed company would take from
deciding that they want to climb this hill
[SPEAKER_00]: versus when they're starting to win cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did you learn your skills?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a mentor or an internship?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get into the scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, basically from the time I was a
young kid on, I think I just had a really
[SPEAKER_01]: a very piqued interest in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, you know, I was turned on to it by
a neighbor who he showed me some killer
[SPEAKER_01]: herb and he was very into High Times
magazine back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of showed me that kind of got
me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really started focusing a lot of my
attention onto the different strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different varieties of,
you know, cannabis around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it wasn't till I hooked up with a
guy that introduced me to Ken Estes from
[SPEAKER_01]: Granddaddy that I that I really took a
stance toward the breeding aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had thought about it before,
but it was never really something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought it was going to be a lot
harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I left that up for the pros to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of out of sight,
out of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But working with Granddaddy, it kind of it
kind of opened up the doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It showed me, you know, what what people
were after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I wanted to create things that I
wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure if I'm putting things out
that I like to smoke, other people would
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some falling out with some
employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was upgraded from seed rep and
online, you know, sales guy to full blown
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder for Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that that that sort of put a fire
under my ass and really brought the light
[SPEAKER_01]: on the whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's a good thing to
point out, too, that you started at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You started doing sales for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who who want to
get into, well, every part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and they want to start at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, man, you know,
a lot of people you start at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: and you learn your skills that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go ahead to start your own
business, you've already done all the jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, sweeping the floors all
the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you better skills to to run
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when you were, you know,
air quotes, breeding at at Granddaddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did that actually involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you doing big sifts or was this more
like manufacturing lines that were
[SPEAKER_00]: preexisting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I came on board with literally absolutely
nothing we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all of our original clone stock was
stripped from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys who were working with him out in
Oakland and NorCal, they all literally
[SPEAKER_01]: left one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just every day everyone grabbed their
shit and left and just left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They left him high and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it was it was a weird situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he knew that he was, you know,
we had a very popular brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing really well at Attitude Seed
Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needed some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically started over with
everything I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had we had our GDP line, which we were
most known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used a GDP mail and another mail,
which was a Tahoe G times Granddaddy Perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that was our pretty much our our
bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started the whole new line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 11 or 12 new strains for him
recreated the Candy Land, which was lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they they lost that one completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I redid it and again made it,
you know, sold out right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, oh, you know,
somebody or other they got they got a
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, you definitely got a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had already been there for a long
time, slanging somebody else's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just happen to be there for the
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's you know, people say,
oh, that's luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's putting in your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, no, I started at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there was there were there was
years, two, three plus years of me
[SPEAKER_01]: literally not getting paid anything but
seeds and then getting to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to keep some part of my sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that sales are made by me driving
around all over the state and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hitting the hitting the stores
hard, you know, back when medical days was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hitting up every single store
from Olympia to Seattle and above there
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to sell them seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one of those things like I had
to put a lot of time and effort in before
[SPEAKER_01]: I was even granted the that the
opportunity to to breed for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then that came with a lot of,
you know, there was a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to it, you know, and a lot of
drama and a lot of things that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: not expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of had a not not a shoe and
that's definitely not the word to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of had we since we already had
a good thing going, I it couldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: been it couldn't have worked out better is
what I'm getting at, because we had
[SPEAKER_01]: already had the ball was already rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if someone who was just getting
started, it's going to be a hell of a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to just pop up in the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm a new breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it takes a little bit to
get accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny how much staying in
cannabis is not getting sucked into drama,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, you know, in the seed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much drama in seeds that that a
lot of the work is actually not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself sucked into that politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I I might have a little bit
of a problem keeping my mouth shut at
[SPEAKER_01]: times because it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so, so many people that want to
give their opinion and say something
[SPEAKER_01]: completely negative or off topic and just
basically just talk shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's it's one of those things you
can be the bigger person say, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what, I'm not going to say I'm not going
to respond, give them the pleasure of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you can just be like,
you know what, I'm going to go a different
[SPEAKER_01]: route.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to be the guy that sticks
up for himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just say what's on my mind
because I don't really even I care what
[SPEAKER_01]: people think of me, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want them to know that I'm not going
to just be a pushover.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have something to say, I'll say
something right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treat people with, you know,
as much respect as you'll give me and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can all be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's very, very drama filled
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you what, it's like it's like high
school over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's clicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that they shake in your
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking like everything's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you walk away, it's fuck that
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, it really, it really just
depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably best to just stay out of the
drama and just kind of focus on your
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I should probably take my own
advice a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's it's really it's cutthroat
industry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so at some point you're working over at
Granddaddy and you had this idea like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what, I want to grow the kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to breed the kind of stuff that I
want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that would that happen early on when
you were still selling or did that did
[SPEAKER_00]: that idea occur to you once you had
already started breeding at Ken's?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a little bit of both, really,
because he knowing what we want to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: and and my own knowledge, he only gave me
the opportunity I was given based on him
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing how I treated the weed,
how how I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could see I was passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of knowledge in the in the in
the strain history of strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was very into my opinion and what I
could come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think he was as soon as I started
talking to him and showing him,
[SPEAKER_01]: he just trusted me from the jump and knew
that there was going to be some good
[SPEAKER_01]: things that came from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some good things come a lot of a
lot of really popular strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the lines, like I said before,
were were totally sold out on Attitude and
[SPEAKER_01]: continued to be as long as we could
produce the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there some time that there was an
overlap between when you started Dungeon's
[SPEAKER_00]: Vault and we're still over at Granddaddy
or did you do was there a clean break
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was 100 percent clean break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want to get into too much
of the the the nitty gritty of what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened, but at the same time,
it's it's it's it's all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I've I've been very vocal about what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a big falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like any other job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called him up and said, hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me putting my resignation in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you the best, but I'm out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was when I immediately
broke ties with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was December of 2014 when that
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally the idea was already sparked
in my head of Dungeon's Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I jokingly tossed the name around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back in like 2009 to actually it
was Red Eye and Reddy, Red Eye Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He I joked him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was as soon as I broke away from
Ken, the idea was just it was already
[SPEAKER_01]: there and I jumped with it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's let's take us back to that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you decided that you are on your own
feet now and Dungeon's Vault is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be real as of today because you had just
given your notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the things that you determined
were the first things that you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: get done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because because obviously you need you
needed to not only get the brand up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running, but you also needed to get
something out to be able to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: money at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were your task priorities at that
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a very good question,
because that that's kind of where the
[SPEAKER_01]: where I had a little bit of trouble at
early on stage is me starting a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly what I was telling you
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can make seeds, but you come to
the market with them and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: it's who are you and how do you get this
and who you know, where did you get your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and how did you breed these?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of questions that come with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what really happened was I I literally
knew immediately that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have I had leftover stock that
wasn't, you know, taken from me when I
[SPEAKER_01]: gave Ken a ton of stuff to go sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was part of the reason we had a
big breakup, because I never ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting paid for, you know, a very large
quantity of seeds were going out to to
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never got my pay on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of what started the
whole, you know, split up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still had stock left over from
granddaddy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically I rebranded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was part of the reason
people were having trouble with me because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, well, you broke away from
granddaddy, but you still have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: strains as granddaddy and you stole them,
which in all reality, I never stole a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked strains for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did everything under my roof with my
money, my lights, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing was stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just odd for people to see me
coming out with the same exact ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had already released under granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest priority for me at that
time was get new strains that separate
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself from him, from, you know,
the whole the split needs to happen and be
[SPEAKER_01]: completely clean, you know, and have your
own line that can that you're coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: with with your own ideas, your own strains
you did and with no one else's input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see how that would be,
you know, both confusing because because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeling legit, you weren't feeling
guilty at all or that you had done
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but the the buying public's all
like, hey, man, this is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so as fast as you could put those
strains behind you and have your own thing
[SPEAKER_00]: going, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so in those early days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, let's let's start with the
ultra basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the name come up for Dungeon's
Vault genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's you know, it's a pretty
unique thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like, you know,
some kind of generic cannabis name like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many of them where to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, no, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear there's for me, cannabis has been,
you know, as some people can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hallucinogens open the doors for certain
things for their art or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cannabis has made me a very creative
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really when it comes down to names
and even my strain names or how I came up
[SPEAKER_01]: with Dungeon's Vault, it's all it's all
comes together with me just sitting around
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking a joint or just thinking to
myself about how what what sounds good or
[SPEAKER_01]: what sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a Dungeons and Dragons fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind if you if you play Dungeons
and Dragons, whether you were a child and
[SPEAKER_01]: played it and loved it or you're into it
as an adult, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just that was not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really rolled those dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dungeons and Dungeons Vault genetics
was something that came up, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: back in I think it was 09.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was online and I was I was making a joke
about all these guys that were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about starting up a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, it's that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are all just going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might as well do it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I'm going to start Dungeons
Vault genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was literally a joke like I was
joking when I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really had thought about the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was already working with Ken at
Grand Eddy and I had no no desire to leave
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had no no plan on leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, it just started making more
and more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's literally it's just I can't say
a ton of thought went into it just just
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to I thought the name was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to really think about,
you know, I guess really if you think
[SPEAKER_01]: about the Dungeon is a cool, dark place
where they keep prisoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing about Canada has to do with,
you know, we don't want to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: being locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really what I was going
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Dungeon is a place that's,
you know, it's locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the vault, even even more so,
it's a locked up vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the dungeon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kept away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the it's a secret place, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those strains, those genetics are kept
up and lock up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're being released to the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where I was going with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny that it just started as an
online, you know, stoner joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the day came that you needed a
name or like, well, shit, I guess I
[SPEAKER_00]: already have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really it was as simple as
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, wow, well, this could know where
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how life works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about something or you put an
idea down on paper and you you might look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it a couple of times here and there,
but you don't really think that it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually be something that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it just it's when
the time's right, things work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always say things happen for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this this worked out and it's worked
out for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I've only seen your your seed
packaging for, say, like the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the artwork, I mean, it's it's
pulled together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about packaging itself in
a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like as far as like the graphic design
of your brand, you know, you can tell when
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a pack of seeds, I can tell it's
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stuff has all got a similar aesthetic
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you developed
yourself or do you work closely with a
[SPEAKER_00]: graphic designer who's helping,
you know, you kind of line all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of both, actually,
you know, so let me let me answer a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally the DVG logo, my shield logo
and the script logo that has become so
[SPEAKER_01]: popular, that's on every one of my
packaging on my clothing and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually done by the breeder at Bay
Exclusives.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy who Bay Exclusive Seeds or Bay
Exclusive Genetics out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he worked with me very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He designed the DVG logo for me and we
kind of talked about it and he helped me
[SPEAKER_01]: get the get that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did that logo for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everything after that,
I worked very closely with with a graphic
[SPEAKER_01]: artist I have locally and then he does all
the printing, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then my designer is actually 420
Friendly Illustrations and he's the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been doing a lot of my art recently
and has helped with my Citrus Farmer logo,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dr. Gonzo, the full metal jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll continue to help me with these
designs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's he's an incredible artist with crazy
talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to that you can get people that
have got mad talent freelance,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, you know, when a company
gets big enough, sure, you can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: designers in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's nice to be able to to work
with somebody who that you respect and
[SPEAKER_00]: produces good work, but not necessarily
have to pay them for all of their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay them for the time that you
need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you had a full time artist on
deck that was sitting there and always I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, I would be paying so much stinking
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it really comes down to is each
design this guy does, it's he's doing he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a ton of work for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I need something done,
I give him some notice in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sit there, we talk about what the
concept is, and then we shoot back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I swear, it's like, by the time it's
done, it's like get out of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally it's so perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so exactly what I wanted to
represent that I couldn't I couldn't ask
[SPEAKER_01]: for a better artist really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, let's go ahead and take our first
short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Eric Wimber,
founder of Dungeons Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil, phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me at the upcoming CanMed event in
Los Angeles for a gathering of the top

[SPEAKER_00]: variety of conditions with cannabis,
including epilepsy, pain, traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury, cancer, autism, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory professionals will share their
revolutionary technologies in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and turpenoid extraction, delivery
methods, and quality and safety testing.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Eric Wimber, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dungeons Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, during the first set,
we were talking a lot about how Dungeons
[SPEAKER_00]: Vault came into being and what your
motivations are around the brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most of the time when I see
you, Eric, you are working a booth at a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis event somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, part of that, I mean,
it's kind of like the Eric Wimber show,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got a big personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are there because, like,
they follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram and they want to,
you know, they want to see you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flesh, you know, because because people
are into their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so you seem like you have to put
out a hell of a lot of energy when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just selling seeds itself,
working a booth itself is exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you're the guy that a lot of
people are there to see, you seem to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to, like, work double.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how grueling is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it's I tell you, you wouldn't think
that just standing there or even if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting down, just sitting there at an
event to sit there and tell people,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, my God, I'm so I'm so tired from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you stood there and talked to people
and smoked weed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: How fucking bad is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds pretty easy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, when you are talking to that
many people, I mean, I've never done a
[SPEAKER_01]: count on how many people come through a
booth or even at those events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's enough there that by the end
of the day, I've barely left the booth
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to go use the restroom or or get
myself something to drink really quick or
[SPEAKER_01]: I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's really I don't get to
walk around very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is gone by end of the day or by
end of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I I I did I made this brand by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of this stuff with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see people at the booth,
they're usually friends of mine or guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that I work with, a tester who I've become
great friends with, who show up at these
[SPEAKER_01]: events and help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I do everything
myself and I like to talk to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be the one behind the booth,
selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my hands on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and know what's being said,
because I want my company represented in a
[SPEAKER_01]: good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want people to walk away knowing
that they had their questions answered and
[SPEAKER_01]: or that they have all the knowledge they
needed when they made that purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's be real here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much money you make,
if you spend any sort of amount of money
[SPEAKER_01]: on seeds, not only are you investing that
money, it's harder than money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you are going to invest a lot of time
into those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to know anything that you want
to know about that strain should be
[SPEAKER_01]: answered at that booth by a knowledgeable
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't have someone there that I
know, can they answer that question with
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 percent confidence?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be right there, standing behind
them, helping anything I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you find that the kind of questions
that people ask you at the booth are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost entirely about the seeds and
cannabis botany and how to grow them and
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of specifics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you find that that actually,
you know, that's a lesser amount of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of people actually want to,
like, you know, get selfies with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: just talk shop or or get, you know,
tell you tell you how much they love
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus farm or like like how much of it is
like people like really needing to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mixed because you have people that
come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get you get the mom and pop that have
literally now that cannabis has become so
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted, they are finally making their
way to an event like, wow, I've never done
[SPEAKER_01]: this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little about your seeds
or oh, I didn't even know they sold these
[SPEAKER_01]: things or whether they've heard of them or
not, they might come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to have a little
conversation about how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seeds have become so popular and
how people are growing them to the the
[SPEAKER_01]: novice farmer, to the guy that just yeah,
they do want advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know everything that's going
on with the strains and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how I grow on what's my choice for
nutrients, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, you got the people that
come by that are fans, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Instagram fans or people that are
just, you know, buddies and and people
[SPEAKER_01]: you've seen at different shows and they
come by to say hello and shake your hand
[SPEAKER_01]: or you just stop by and smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that gets into the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked earlier, I'm so busy at those
booths talking to people and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure everything's flowing correctly
that I rarely have time to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even when you came by last time,
I was trying I could see you stand there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say hi to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm in the middle of a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how rude to just walk away from a
conversation and then ignore that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to do everything I can to make
sure everyone feels respected and that
[SPEAKER_01]: they are being taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can step away and say hello to
someone or try and talk to some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at times it can be hard because I've
only got a couple of people work in my
[SPEAKER_01]: booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I would really rather be the
one talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and certainly when I see you at
events, I know that your job there is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell, you know, and and and when and when,
you know, you didn't have time for me
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a loop and I came back and you had
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we said, hey, then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, yeah, I think it's important
for people who are, you know, who are who
[SPEAKER_00]: are fans but not particularly planning on
buying that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to understand that they need to
like step aside so that the person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you know, a hundred dollar bill in
their hand gets your attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's, you know, that's that's
why the whole thing can continue is
[SPEAKER_00]: because that sale is going to happen,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the reason why I made
these laminated menus now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can just when I'm talking to someone,
I can see out the corner of my eye that
[SPEAKER_01]: someone wants to talk to me or someone
wants to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can just very, very politely hand
them a menu so they can see what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on and they can hopefully have a question
answered that I can continue to show this
[SPEAKER_01]: other person the respect they deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And continue their conversation until they
walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can just try and shuttle the people
that want to talk aside and let the people
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking to buy another aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's what I should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's it's nice to talk to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always see fans and friends from from
every show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I know that, you know, the shows on
the West Coast are chill and pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm assuming that you spend a lot of
time in the newer states as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, Michigan for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how sketchy is it going
into some of these newer states carrying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not only all of your product to
sell at the event, but also like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your personal stash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, you're clearly not
going to be, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a medical card in all these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the laws are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that with, you know,
everything that all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on the line that that could get
pretty sketch sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've got a few stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some airports that are pretty comical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, no, for the most part,
they they really don't seeds are really
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: TSA and most other people have made it
very clear that that's not something
[SPEAKER_01]: they're concerned with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me traveling with seeds so far hasn't
been an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say once you start bringing,
you know, certain amounts of of weed with
[SPEAKER_01]: you on the plane or whatever, you might
want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I kind of leave all
that shit behind and let people know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I'm traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm traveling from another state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I don't have 10 jars with a
quarter pound in each jar so you can smell
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and make a judgment on what you
want to buy is because, hey, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to jail for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not it's just not logical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there's really no way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless I'm driving across state lines
and even then same thing, I can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing weed across state lines that way
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really it's funny, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to really build your brand and
let people know what you got, because if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're if they're counting on smelling a
jar to make their their choice,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be hard for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's it's it's it's so far for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to the other states has been
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Michigan, honestly, one of my
favorite places to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They I'm so well received there and I've
got nothing but love for Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys show me so much support out
there, even more so than any other state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think more than California,
more than Oregon, more than more than
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan has my back and is a huge
supporter of all things Dungeon and Vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Michigan farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's funny, too,
because, you know, so many of us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast between, you know, having
medical for almost 20 years, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of us have gotten used to
what it's like to be around easily
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible top shelf weed and feeling
generally safe that we're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm actually from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go home to visit my family and I
see friends from back in the day and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the fact that they now have got,
you know, more advanced medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting, you know, cool products
out there to see it reflected in their
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes being so recently out of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me to be grateful that I live
on the West Coast and that I've even taken
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this stuff for granted at this
point, because I'm around it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you go back behind the
prohibition curtain and people are all
[SPEAKER_00]: like, man, I can't even believe I can buy
this stuff legally, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it's times have changed and it
wasn't long ago that I was arrested for a
[SPEAKER_01]: possession of marijuana charge here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember asking the state chief,
I said, man, you guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When are you going to just fucking
legalize this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, not any time soon,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that wasn't that long ago and here
we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we were talking about the
laws around the seeds and that the TSA
[SPEAKER_00]: really doesn't care all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people, you know,
in the olden days, like five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they didn't want to ship seeds
into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and then people in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really want to ship seeds from
state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, like lots of people are mailing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people,
I ask, like, why do you feel safe doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, our seeds are,
you know, for souvenir only, which doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem like it would be a hustle that would
necessarily stand up in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are the rules around shipping
and selling seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really at any risk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very, very strange because you've
got so many different people with an
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion on the legalities of it and how,
you know, like how it all is playing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't even know what to think,
you know, because you got you got one
[SPEAKER_01]: person saying, you know, it's it's
agricultural trash seed are not looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: as as an item that is it shouldn't it's
not illegal, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you got other people that are
saying, for instance, at Canna Con this
[SPEAKER_01]: last a couple of few weeks ago,
the Cannabis Liquor Control Board came in
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were saying that, you know,
seed sales in Washington state is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have seeds on my on my table was
essentially the same as having marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: displayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, very, very strict when it comes to
the whole recreational side of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think they're really after the
whole seed to sale thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to make sure that,
you know, they're getting theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very weird because at the same
time, they're telling me that it's illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: and this and that, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've personally been told and seen it
written on paper that seeds do not have
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in them and therefore are not illegal
and are, like I said earlier, considered
[SPEAKER_01]: trash and or a souvenir or whatever you
like to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But seed sales, I think, has increased so
much because like you mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_01]: five years ago, even more than that maybe
was you if you weren't ordering your seed
[SPEAKER_01]: from Attitude Seed Bank or from,
say, Herbie's Head Shop or wherever you
[SPEAKER_01]: were wherever you were getting them from,
there was all of our sources were
[SPEAKER_01]: overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then unless you knew a private breeder
here in town, you know, you could get some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the varieties and all the hybrids and
everything that has come out is is over
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's absolutely crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that we are we are very
lucky to have so many talented people in
[SPEAKER_01]: one area that we can actually get what we
are getting because now what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you ever order seeds from
another country at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're going to have the people
get their seeds taken from customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then who's to say you're even getting
what you're paying for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's that's really any seed bank
you order from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have guys with great reputations here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just why risk it anywhere else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got mad, mad talent here in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to our second break,
I want to ask you about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have got a really rabid following,
you know, your followers are hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, sometimes things can
get pretty rambunctious on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how how how does that play
into, you know, your your bigger work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, you know, essentially that
is part of your advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're participating with people
and, yeah, you're teaching them about your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you know, you get you get like
these jerks who show up and then suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: people who's defending you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like this this this this thing
explodes on your Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you you know, how do you what's
your perspective on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that as just being like healthy
and fun or do you try to have there not be
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because because when you've got what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty four thousand followers and
everybody is passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to happen often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's it's a I kind of got
into this earlier with you, but it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's weird because I want to be the guy
who's I'm not going to turn my cheek and
[SPEAKER_01]: get slapped again, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I think there's
there is a point where you need to just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of step back and and either defuse
the situation or just delete everything
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what the example you brought up,
there's a few times where I can think of
[SPEAKER_01]: where there was a post made or there was
something said and it led into just some
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred plus comments thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, or I've got people that follow
me attacking other people and then people
[SPEAKER_01]: just trolling me hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all reality, what good is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: None.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does get me some some more people
paying attention to the page than other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing you know, I got I got more
followers that are looking at things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it gets good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a curse and a blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I think for the most part,
it's probably better to just keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: nose out of that shit and just let the let
the troll pages and the meme pages handle
[SPEAKER_01]: all the huge arguments and you just kind
of represent your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's more of the line I'm trying
to take as of recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm I'm a very
passionate person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very friendly guy, but I'm also
someone who's got, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, anger issues here and there,
so I can easily lose my cool and say
[SPEAKER_01]: things I don't mean or maybe I do mean it
at the time, but just say things that
[SPEAKER_01]: might come across another person is a real
jerky thing to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in all reality, I'm really just I'm
not going to let people walk on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can appreciate the people that can,
you know, let's let's all just get along
[SPEAKER_01]: and let's just all smoke a joint and go
hug a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, sometimes people
just need to get put in their place and be
[SPEAKER_01]: told that, you know, it don't it's just
your comment was unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to fricking hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got my the followers that
they will literally go and I'm not telling
[SPEAKER_01]: them, not telling people to go do these
things and they will literally go and just
[SPEAKER_01]: light a fire under someone's ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, oh, my gosh, I would you
you had I had no idea the outcome of what
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these things are going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just it's it's comical at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like I said, if I see something
for the most part, I don't leave that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff up on my page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let it go for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll speak my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say what I need to say and then boom,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I came up with a term for that
that I use with clients a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it a spectacle marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's you know, it's something
that happens like like a master of this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a Jonah Tacoma from Dab Stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he does these big things that are
just like crazy and outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people all want to watch it because
it's like a house on fire or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gets everybody excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He milks it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just moves on to the next
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes these these online fights
can be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like, oh, my God, I can't believe
like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of follow the thread
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, so as nobody gets
truly violent with each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can always just delete it
down the line and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's really what I've tried
to do, because I think that sometimes when
[SPEAKER_01]: I post something, whether it be drama
related or I'm calling someone out for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing something stupid or whatever it may
be, I want people to see what I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it doesn't need to just be an
ongoing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I've spoken my mind or I've said what
I want to say and enough people have
[SPEAKER_01]: commented or seen it, then they can go
tell their friends or whatever that what
[SPEAKER_01]: they saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I I don't think anyone should just
be allowed to be off, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let off the hook for stuff they do or say
if you've said or done something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really faulty, then own up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's if you're going to get caught
out on social media, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just that's how it is nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your nose clean and don't say
things you don't mean or or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to say things you don't that you do
mean, they get ready to back them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so it's it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so after after that, yeah, after the
break, I want to we're going to talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about your particular strain lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but one more question before we go to
that break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I have heard you talk about
testers a lot about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of attributes that you like in a
tester and the kind of people that deserve
[SPEAKER_00]: to receive test seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then all the yahoos that just
waste your seeds and you never hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's there's clearly a
lot of people who are listening today who
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to be a tester for you or for
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what what do you see as being
the attributes of a good tester and how
[SPEAKER_00]: should somebody approach a breeder so that
they get, you know, so they start off on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right foot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally gone about this in so
many ways that I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I at this point, I'm going to start doing
face to face interviews like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I literally don't I don't know what to
do because I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I've literally done it this way where
I look at someone I say, OK, this guy's
[SPEAKER_01]: got X amount of followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He obviously has people checking out his
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he's very he's very, you know,
he's on Instagram a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's spent a lot of time on there and
showing people what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kind of person I would think
would be my ideal tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, I think with in parentheses,
because that's really that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought would be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got guys that have a very,
very low following with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hardly any followers at all, but they grow
killer bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all they are trying to do is is get
their foot in the door so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully one day, you know, be more like
a permanent tester or be have some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: way to get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if being someone's grower and and
helping them test strains and all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden they've I've used 10 of that guy's
photos on my page to advertise for my
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably made it into a spot where I
will always hit him up, maybe even invite
[SPEAKER_01]: him out for a cup to come hang out and,
you know, come meet the guys and and
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, get get more strains to
grow out himself or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm looking to build relationships
with these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want I don't want some
some girl or guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, growing for men and me never
even knowing who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having some online persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to engage with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me that there's too many
people that are they are so quick to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I want to test for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They promise everything from the moon and
back and then they don't do what they say
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are there are circumstances
that happen and you got to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: be understanding because everybody doesn't
have an easy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things that pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all sorts of stuff out
of our control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I see happening more times than
not is is people asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And or begging for seeds and then they
don't even do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put them in their stash or maybe they
do grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ever tell me about it because
they just wanted something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have something that sets them
apart from their their friend who's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you know, something that everyone
already has right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see it's very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably super hella frustrating,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, let's go ahead and take that
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Eric Wimber,
founder of Dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dungeon's Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money, so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy, and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small-scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of
well-cared-for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Forever Flowering Greenhouses to
partner with folks who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable reputation as knowledgeable
and easy to work with.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes, and our guest
this week is Eric Wimber, founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dungeon's Vault Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, up to this point,
we've talked a lot about how someone would
[SPEAKER_00]: start a seed company and a lot of the,
you know, the goods and the bads that you
[SPEAKER_00]: went through to get to where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus this last set specifically
on the gear that you put out, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, you know, actually I love
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown, and, you know, a lot of that I
think has to do with the fact that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really rely a lot on this fabulous
grandpa's breath strain as what seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: your dominant male that you work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you find the grandpa's breath and,
you know, where did your love affair with
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant start?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when I was still working with
Granddaddy, I had came to Kin because
[SPEAKER_01]: everything with that brand was obviously
based on the GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granddaddy, grandpa, anything like that
was all had to do with the marketing for
[SPEAKER_01]: that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I originally told him, hey,
there's this clone going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very held back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not passed to too many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exclusive, and it was the OG
Kush breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking back in like 2009,
2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, it was early on in the
stages of my breeding that this OG KB
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting passed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends in California that looked
after me and were very good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to mention his name,
but he's a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very well known in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me clones because he knew
that, you know, I was good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to do anything bad with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he trusted me with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And OG KB to me was that was the best
cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a good smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those ones that if you had it,
you had something others didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, Gage Green, myself,
and maybe one or two other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: very few of us had that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were the first to bring any of
these breath strains to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what anyone says.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could argue till night about,
you know, it was Gage Green with their
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo breath and the Grateful breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I shortly came after,
Shory was out with the Grandpa's breath
[SPEAKER_01]: right after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew from the start of the male,
when I first crossed the OG KB with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe GDP, I knew immediately once I found
this male, this thing was so just stout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had, I mean, it made the last males
that I found when I was working with
[SPEAKER_01]: Grant, it looked like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just really, I knew it was
going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I continued forth my project,
I saw what was coming out of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I saw tested and grown out
was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was really just something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really why it was used in
everything because rather than using too
[SPEAKER_01]: many strains and having a bunch of stuff
that I'm not certain is going to be great,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found something special and I knew
that's what I was going to base everything
[SPEAKER_01]: off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grandpa's breath has got something for
everybody too, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people have asked me before, like,
I really like the follow mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people asked me to describe the
Grandpa's breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, well, you know,
it's, it's, it's fuely, but it's got some
[SPEAKER_00]: floral in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but it's got some of those like old
school alcohol esters like skunk does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are like, so it essentially,
you know, tastes like and smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, yeah, I guess it kind of
does, you know, it's, it's, it's not one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these strains that your pigeon hold
into one descriptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the cool things about F1s is
that you can play, you get to experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to treasure hunt, phenos still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I enjoy that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, it's, it's from what I
will say that I've noticed for sure with
[SPEAKER_01]: this male, no matter what it's touched,
you still get, you still get dominance
[SPEAKER_01]: from the, from the female half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that male brings so much frost and so
much kind of like almost like an
[SPEAKER_01]: earthiness and berries is kind of what I
would describe, because everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you, there's always kind of a
grapey, musky berry thing going on in some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the phenos, no matter which,
what you grow, but there's always going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the dominant, you know, female
phenotype that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like you said, there's a little
bit of something for everybody because
[SPEAKER_01]: people like the purple, you get that the
bag of pill is there with every strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter what you choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, some people, they,
they're what's your biggest yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few that actually yield
quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprisingly, because of having the
Girl Scout and then the OG and GDP,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't think those three strains
together are going to create something
[SPEAKER_01]: that yields heavy, but surprisingly enough
it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's many growers who have tried
my strains out, have reported back above
[SPEAKER_01]: average yields even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once these, once these strains get
dialed in and you know what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with them, I mean, they can really be
rewarding in so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a lot of fun too,
for when, you know, once your seed started
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the street and people who you did
not know personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so obviously your, your friends in
your inner circle were growing your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people start to report back
beyond your sphere of influence that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing your stuff and really
liking it, there's got to be a lot of self
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction in knowing that other people
are digging on, on your, on your baby,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my, my first years in with Ken and
all that stuff, I was seeing people
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing me samples to the shows and the,
Hey, this is your purple champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is the, this is the grand OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this, this is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was super stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was, I was happy with what I was
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a little pat on my own back,
you know, like I made that that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was my, it was a dream and
now it's come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've noticed now with this
grandpa's breath line, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what you bring by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so impressed with every single sample
that gets brought to my table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always so happy and so excited to
see the next one that someone has,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's always been, it's,
it's very rewarding feeling, but not only
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it's, it's just cool because this is
what I've always wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've wanted to make strains that I would
be happy to smoke and stuff that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to be sitting there smoking on a
strain that I created and knowing that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not, you know, I'm, I'm not just smoking
it cause I create, I'm smoking it cause I
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I would actually
recommend to other people to try not just,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just to create a sale, but because,
Hey, this is good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single time I hear from someone
that they enjoy my strains, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: another, you know, huge blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I know I'm doing something
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the far out things I think for
being a breeder versus a big, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production grower is that
you're winning cups, cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, you're not winning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's the people who have bought your
gear who are then winning the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, your work is winning the
cup put together with their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must be a strange feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what was it like the first time that
one of your strains won a cup that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else grew?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that was insane because it wasn't
just one cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy he goes by the name big worm
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: He literally, he makes incredible oil,
but he was over in Massachusetts is where
[SPEAKER_01]: he's based out of, but he, he got,
he placed at the secret cup for the East
[SPEAKER_01]: coat or for, I don't remember where it was
at, but he placed at the secret cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: made it to the finals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with my citrus farmer strain,
he literally swept the competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he won in one night best overall,
highest Terps and best shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in one night and that was all
first place awards for citrus farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to smoke the oil shortly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, absolutely burnt orange,
just absolute dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk about feeling, feeling really
cool and having a, a moment that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's, that's awesome to know
that people are, are that impressed with
[SPEAKER_01]: the strain and it's coming out that,
that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are, are really, you know,
positive reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it makes you feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and in the end it is also a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that once people started
winning cups with your gear, that that
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped at the box office too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because suddenly people are all like,
wow, I hadn't heard of that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look it up and suddenly they're on
your IG and now they're trying to totally
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with you at a, at an event or
something to buy the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably makes all the difference in
the world when, when your stuff starts
[SPEAKER_00]: winning awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangy, tangy with Crockett and DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys blew up with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say for certain that that's the
first orange strain I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange strains have been around for years
and years, but they kind of, they kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, really set the standard for orange
strains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was given my skunk tangerine cut
from Oregon kid, um, that one is one that
[SPEAKER_01]: is so, it's so held back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very few people have that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of breeders working with it
is to me and archive seeds is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I have it as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen anyone else using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else is working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had such a strong smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew right then and there that that
was going to be something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as soon as people saw it and smelt it
and got to see what they were going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: from my seeds, they were going to,
it was going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We released a citrus farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Emerald cup in 2015, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sold out that weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it was not even, let's see,
that was December, 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, later on in the year,
2016 was when, when citrus farmer really
[SPEAKER_01]: blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won four awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won those three at secret cup for the
shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the week after that, it won,
um, at a, another event over in Maine or
[SPEAKER_01]: on the East coast for the flower at one
third place overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really started making waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even to this day, everyone that grows
it has, has left bat left me such positive
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback and has really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very well reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that like trying to choose your,
your favorite strain is like trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, choose a favorite child or
something, but is there, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strain, um, in, in your line
that you feel especially warm to like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like, you know, maybe it's,
maybe it's the first cop or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that, that, you know,
was especially difficult for you to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: That man, it's such, it's like you said,
it's like trying to choose your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: child.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make sure they're not looking when you
say it, but I mean, really it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's since they can't hear me,
I would say that if I had to choose
[SPEAKER_01]: overall, if I'm left on an Island with one
strand of smoke, that's so hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would say hot rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my, that, or the, the ones that are
sold out, my swamp thing or lost soul,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything OG Kim sour flavor, anything
that's you cracked that jar and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smell it across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have found so much gas out of the
hot rod that that really was that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that to me is probably my go-to favorite,
but the grandpa's breath, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very, like right there, I've been
smoking on grandma's breath the past two
[SPEAKER_01]: days and I love that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works out so well for me for sleep and
for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a very heavy narcotic high and I
really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but hot rod, just because of the,
the taste, the turps, the smell overall,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything about it, it's just,
it's really what I'm after when I,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to what I choose for my
cannabis strain on a daily, I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like you have, I mean,
everybody does, you know, limited runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like you have really gone pro
with, with how you're doing the limited
[SPEAKER_00]: runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for, for anybody who did not,
who wasn't at Emerald cup this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is pretty much how it went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you had, you had these,
these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess I'm trying to telling your
story for you, but you could, you had
[SPEAKER_00]: these trials that you weren't sure if you
were going to go all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so like what 48 hours before
Emerald cup opens up, you drop photos of
[SPEAKER_00]: these crosses on a, on Instagram,
which like freaks all your fans out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, as, as the morning,
first morning of Emerald cup and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like sipping on their coffee and like
stretching and stuff, you've already got a
[SPEAKER_00]: line from the front of your booth,
you know, 45 people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep and everybody else like, what the
fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and because I follow you on IG,
I'm like, ah, well, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to get the limited edition stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you surprised at how successful the
marketing was for those limited editions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me and my buddy that I drove down
there with, we sat there over dinner and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're having a drink one the night before
Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it was, maybe it was that
Thursday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were going to set up the next
morning one way or another we're sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: there thinking, we're like, you know,
how should we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, do I want to,
I mean, do I want to just tell people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what I ended up doing was I told
people the, how limited they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: how the fact that there's only so many
packs available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I, what I did was I actually
opened it up to, to some people before the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made it even more exclusive by
offering people, if you can pay now and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to pre buy it, go right ahead,
you know, send me the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that and I literally had so many
messages and so many people automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: want to pay that I just was like,
wow, I had no idea it was going to blow up
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as that morning came that Saturday
morning, like you mentioned, there were so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people already waiting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even set up yet and people were
standing there with cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, can I buy this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I buy that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm not even, hold on one sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get, let me get this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even, I'm just setting up,
but it was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took video cause I've never been
that busy ever at any show where I had
[SPEAKER_01]: that many people waiting in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm dropping the next iPhone or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the, those seeds that were all your
limited editions are, do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to move forward with all of
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were those just, you know, fun things
that you figured on the side and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you just, you just wanted to get
them out, but you're not going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned archive really.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made a joke one time where he made a
meme about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, you know, it was like the
breeders list to, you know, like what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what that, what that really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people will say limited edition
means totally untested, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: high priced, you know, BS, just somewhat
sub breeder wants to put something out
[SPEAKER_01]: real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened was I had a run where I
fully intended on there being a hell of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more seeds in there were that the,
the, the, the mail just didn't put out as
[SPEAKER_01]: much pollen as I was hoping it would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, I think what, what really
happened was I miscalculated my run days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling on myself right here,
but let's just keep it real with
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I pulled, I think a week early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of the seeds weren't even as
fully developed as they should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it was all said and done and I
counted stuff, there was some where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I want this strain release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is too good not to release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after testing it, we knew that we had
some killer stuff, but there was not as
[SPEAKER_01]: much numbers as I normally would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put them up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that want them, it's going to be a
limited edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them while they're hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's, it's up to you if
you want them great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, I mean, I, they were very
well accepted and everybody was super
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked to get in line and get some of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that, uh, I would like all
of them to be something in my line that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, what I'm starting to
realize is, and I don't think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people realize this either is I'm working
very, uh, exclusively, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, it's, it's, I'm doing things,
um, alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a, I don't have a huge team
I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I don't have a gigantic facility
I'm breeding out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have unlimited numbers when it
comes to these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have, I don't have a hundred
different rooms to make all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what it comes down to is I do
more or less, um, kind of boutique runs
[SPEAKER_01]: and boutique drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and now that's how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, if you're in, if you're in
that line and you get ahold of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: then great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that, I really mean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're limited as in I might,
it might be another year or two before I
[SPEAKER_01]: remake them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things like I've got,
I've got so many great ones that I've now
[SPEAKER_01]: released and have become popular off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, you know, I mean, people are
asking for certain ones to come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got so many other ones I need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to stay relevant and make
new strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's overwhelming at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing you asked her
about people wanting to get into this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and how easy is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ded, you're dedicating your life to
making seeds and then you got to test
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds and you got to grow those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about six months down
the line before you can even do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in those six months, I've got zero
gardens I'm cropping out either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not growing anything for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally just making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, it's so it's, it's how it's,
it's very difficult at times to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and have it all, you know,
make sure you got everything that people
[SPEAKER_01]: want and, and, you know, taking care of
everything you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably frees you up to a certain
degree too, that you're not having to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in product, you know, heavy
commercial production level of flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, growing flowers full
time is, is a, is an arduous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you, you specialize on
doing seeds, you know, like a ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I find that across our
industry, people who are specializing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we all need to know
something about everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all these parts fit in together,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I think that the people who are
allowed to really study their particular
[SPEAKER_00]: discipline and they do it better than
anybody, they reap the rewards because
[SPEAKER_00]: most everybody else is just kind of like a
dilettante.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I'll say, not, not to,
I'm not trying to toot my own horn here or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, but I have focused on trying to
make strains that I knew were going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally released, I believe 12,
12 strains or so were in my line from the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I told you I left granddaddy on at
that first Emerald Cup 2014, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, 2015 was when I first had all
my line fully released for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there was, at one point I told
people, I said, I'm not making any more
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to let this line
ride for a while till I see everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: grown them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be a guy that's got,
you know, when someone comes up to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: what strain do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got 50, you know, here,
let me, let me try and pick one out for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, let's have you grown any of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got 12 to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have you do this one and come back
in two months and let's try another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really encourage people to let me
help you find something from my line that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just, just give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you trust in my brand and you like what
you, you try, tried before, then you will
[SPEAKER_01]: love all the other ones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things I really want
to be more of a, more of an exclusive
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder to where I don't have 150 strains
in the few years I've been out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've got the, my original line and
I've just now broken off into making a few
[SPEAKER_01]: more and I've got more that are in testing
now, but I've, I'm not quick to jump to
[SPEAKER_01]: market with, you know, more than I can
chew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to say that I've grown
and I've seen things grown in can give you
[SPEAKER_01]: some solid feedback on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Eric, I know that your time is
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to thank you for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I want to double thank you
too, because I'm not, and just anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: would come on the show and talk about,
you know, how to build a business because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in a certain way you're,
you're giving out some of your special
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce secrets for how you built Dungeons
Vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that there's people out there
that you're inspiring during this show who
[SPEAKER_00]: are now going to make seeds and are
therefore, you know, seeing themselves as
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you are so comfortable in,
you know, who you are and your business
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were open to, you know,
to talk shop with me other than just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your own strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you both taking your time
and, and, and talking about how you did it
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the next generation can come up
behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed myself and, and to
anybody out there looking to get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and or do their own seed
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know that it's, it's like I said,
it's a cutthroat business, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean, you know, don't try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say do what you love and I love what I
do and I wouldn't have it any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone tells you not to do it,
just don't talk to them anymore because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're obviously not looking out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do your thing and enjoy life and just
do, let's all have fun here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
