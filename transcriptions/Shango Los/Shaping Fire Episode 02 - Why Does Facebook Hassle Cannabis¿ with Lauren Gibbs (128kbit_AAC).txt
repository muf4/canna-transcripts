[SPEAKER_02]: For both cannabis businesses and cannabis
activists, the primary goal nowadays is
[SPEAKER_02]: outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are business, you are reaching out
to new customers, establishing your brand
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, and securing market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: For activists, you are teaching people
about the benefits of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get legislation passed,
and attracting more activists to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the best way to do that,
of course, is social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is astonishingly cheap compared to
print, radio, and TV advertisements
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even more importantly, it is fast and
very responsive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fast that we can even perform real-time
A-B tests to find out what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising delivers the message most
effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Facebook and Instagram are
screwing up the efficiency of the process
[SPEAKER_02]: by using obscure advertising guidelines
and selective enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have 50,000 or more people in
your audience only to have your page
[SPEAKER_02]: deleted without warning and suddenly be
invisible and unable to contact all of
[SPEAKER_02]: your followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is absurd that this is still happening,
and it puts American businesses at risk
[SPEAKER_02]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's worse is that Facebook and
Instagram are now suppressing political
[SPEAKER_02]: content as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One social media professional has taken it
upon herself to speak up for all of us and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to get social media platforms to
commit to a clear set of guidelines so
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone in cannabis can place advertising
in a way that is not full of guessing and
[SPEAKER_02]: hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's guest is Lauren Gibbs,
founder of Rise Above Social Strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lauren empowers nonprofits and businesses
to use social media strategies that build
[SPEAKER_02]: communities around brands and causes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has developed award-winning campaigns,
coaches business leaders and nonprofits in
[SPEAKER_02]: social media strategy, and is a
sought-after public speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: She established the original social
strategy for Women Grow and currently
[SPEAKER_02]: directs initiatives for Willie Nelson's
cannabis brand, Willie's Law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lauren has held multiple positions in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: House of Representatives and has a master
of public administration and nonprofit
[SPEAKER_02]: management from George Washington
University and a bachelor's degree in
[SPEAKER_02]: political science and philosophy from
Albright College.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, she'll be talking to us about her
hashtag, end the social cannabis campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited to be here on Shaping Fire
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, let's set out the groundwork
for our conversation today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in what ways do you see both
cannabis companies and cannabis activists
[SPEAKER_02]: being treated unfairly by social media
platforms like Facebook and Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the content that cannabis companies
share is viewed by Facebook as illegal in
[SPEAKER_00]: many circumstances, even when it's
advocating for the legality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, in addition to just doing
business, they're also stopping posts
[SPEAKER_02]: about what?
[SPEAKER_02]: About legalization in states and different
initiatives that are happening at the
[SPEAKER_02]: state level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that's the most upsetting part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's an argument to be made
that cannabis businesses should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise like alcohol companies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also talking about cannabis
businesses and advocates that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those posts specific to advocacy,
awareness, customer education continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: be blocked every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that a lot of us in the
cannabis industry, I mean, we've all heard
[SPEAKER_02]: of one company or another that got to,
you know, 30,000, 60,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, they're gone for
a day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see them come back and they
say, oh, we were deleted at 50,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, please like us and tell your
friends again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for cannabis businesses, that hits
their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That injures their reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they're working in their own
state legally, but it seems a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: mischievous to stop advocacy and the
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That political speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me an example of an advocacy
campaign that is being hindered by social
[SPEAKER_02]: media platforms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here in Denver, right now we have a
Yes on 300 initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an initiative to allow social
use of cannabis so that people,
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists and individuals can legally
consume in locations outside of their home
[SPEAKER_00]: that they own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty straightforward
neighborhood social supported social use
[SPEAKER_00]: pilot program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And repeatedly these ads are being blocked
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that they're being blocked,
the notification states that the ad is
[SPEAKER_00]: being blocked because they promote illegal
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when they complain, what does
Facebook say?
[SPEAKER_02]: When they say, hey, we're not promoting
illegal activity, we're encouraging people
[SPEAKER_02]: to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it would be great if when we
complained, we got an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they prompt you with this
response, they do explicitly state that
[SPEAKER_00]: this ad promotes illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they state, however, ads that promote
awareness or advocacy are allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think we made a mistake,
please contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis businesses are contacting
Facebook and they appeal these ads and the
[SPEAKER_00]: appeals just sit in purgatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not get a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I ever got a response from
an appeal was after I contacted a BuzzFeed
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter who sent screen grabs of my
denial to Facebook PR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not an acceptable route for
other business owners.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first wave, because I've gotten
several of those advertising rejections
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all seem like they're kind of
just sent back to me by a bot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not even a human playing
along.
[SPEAKER_02]: From your research into this, do you know
how their process works?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at what point does a real human
even look at my ad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do think that humans do look at a
lot of the ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they review millions of ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is outsourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this happens outside of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the sense that the ads on the Rise
Above Social Strategies Facebook page are
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow getting rooted into some other
approval process, because typically ads
[SPEAKER_00]: are approved or denied within 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give Facebook a lot of credit for
turning them around really quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you think social media is
incredibly timely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an ad that's super
appropriate and topical to some thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening in that hour, you can get an
ad approved in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I post about cannabis,
anything related to cannabis advocacy or
[SPEAKER_00]: even related to their censorship,
those ads take between eight and 36 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: to be approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me that someone has to go
with their supervisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has got to be some conversation
happening internally when they make that
[SPEAKER_00]: decision for it to be that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of cannabis, it is unheard of to
have an ad take that long for approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually makes me chuckle a little
bit, thinking about when I place the
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising for this episode to see how
long it takes them to accept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably on their hot list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope that you report that back to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I don't know of some stuff
that I do get approved and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and follow the rules around
advocacy and we still get denied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these things that are promoted
that are a blatant violation of the terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of service, but you manage to get them
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a complete inconsistency in the
application of terms of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my goal is to have Facebook and
Instagram provide us clear guidelines that
[SPEAKER_00]: industry professionals and advocates can
follow and then that Facebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram can fairly enforce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's focus in on the selective
enforcement of the guidelines for a
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you started the End the Social
Cannabin campaign, I'm sure that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: attracted a lot of feedback and interest
from people who have not had their ads
[SPEAKER_02]: approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me an example of two similar
ads that one was approved and one was not
[SPEAKER_02]: for no reason that we know about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think a classic example is
Catherine Grimm, who was on CNN's High
[SPEAKER_00]: Profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: CNN was promoting that series actively
using paid sponsorship to promote their
[SPEAKER_00]: television show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Catherine Grimm as a character on that
show was trying to promote it as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone in that position would and should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her ads were getting denied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually a really great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were same or similar ads,
one from the media company and one from
[SPEAKER_02]: the individual human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the media company was getting accepted
and the human was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it really depends on who you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that really makes sense with
the example that you gave earlier about
[SPEAKER_02]: how you have probably bombarded Facebook
with messages looking for clarification,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it wasn't until somebody with a lot of
ears like BuzzFeed writing directly to the
[SPEAKER_02]: PR folks at Facebook that they had any
response at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did they say?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did they say when they responded to
BuzzFeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they just say they erroneously denied
my ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me state for the record that was
an ad promoting a Colorado public radio
[SPEAKER_00]: story about racial disparities in youth
arrest rates for marijuana in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't that doesn't even make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes I can even understand
that Facebook's lawyers are so afraid of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis businesses that that they may
want some more security before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can kind of see that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with an article like that,
it's only tangentially even about the
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase and sale of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about, you know, law enforcement,
prisons and race relations.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could I see?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see your frustration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a lot of binary every time
you try and promote something you you
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really can't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work in social media outside of
cannabis and well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's never this wild card that you
can actually use advertising to plan the
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion of your business, your advocacy
campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some sense of reliability that
that can be a useful strategy to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: your cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that avenue is just not available to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how widespread did this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've been kind of picking on
Facebook so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But across the different social media
platforms, is there some variety of who is
[SPEAKER_02]: more generous with cannabis folks and who
is less?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Facebook and Instagram are you know,
that's one company and they're they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a single set of advertising
guidelines that applies to to both
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you run your ads through a single
dashboard for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that Facebook and Instagram
treat it equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see I don't hear of much of a
crackdown on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my professional opinion,
for a lot of companies, Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook is a more powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I often hear people saying,
oh, you can go over to Twitter where they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't enforce this or you could go over to
these other cannabis specific social
[SPEAKER_00]: networks that have far smaller audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just not an acceptable solution
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being relegated to the backwater is not a
solution when you're trying to promote any
[SPEAKER_02]: idea to the largest audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take our first short
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire as a
business owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are incredibly busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you certainly don't have the time and
you're not ready to hire someone full time
[SPEAKER_02]: for that role either.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blunt branding principles, Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_02]: very pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they leave responsibility for
improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_02]: of sale and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with blunt branding on three
projects now for various clients and every
[SPEAKER_02]: single time they have done more than they
have promised and over delivered on
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_02]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me and that just
[SPEAKER_02]: does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_02]: give blunt branding a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_02]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_02]: automatic and trackable.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our guest this week is Lauren Gibbs of
Rise Above Social Strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lauren, before the break, we were
talking about how all of the social media
[SPEAKER_02]: platforms, but specifically Facebook and
Instagram, probably at the worst,
[SPEAKER_02]: is selective in how they apply their
guidelines in accepting ads from both
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies and cannabis advocacy
groups at the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of behind this whole thing is
this idea that Facebook is afraid of
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
go, well, it's probably because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even that makes me more curious
because at the state level, these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are legal and acting as good
actors in their states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't know anybody who's looking
into this more than you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as the expert, can you give us some
ideas, even if they're just suggestions on
[SPEAKER_02]: what might be going through the minds of
the attorneys at Facebook and Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: that caused them to be so concerned and
not want to share community guidelines on
[SPEAKER_02]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think federal prohibition can't be
understated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a natural fear of racketeering
charges, drug trafficking charges for a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge company like Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Facebook has the technology available
to geotarget and age restrict posts to
[SPEAKER_00]: states that have legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use them when we can get ads
approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why not leverage that technology even
further and allow us to use it and thrive
[SPEAKER_00]: in that environment where we're only
speaking to customers in our states?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you think that the attorneys are
honestly afraid of the government bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: federal racketeering charges?
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like such an absurd idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's at the cornerstone of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this whole topic is absurd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be something that I would
just have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But does anybody suggest that that would
actually happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just Facebook, because they're so
valued and they're a public company,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to play super safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the lawyers are always going to tell
you to play it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll point out that something is
illegal federally and we shouldn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the heart of my argument here
is that I think that honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Mark Zuckerberg probably
agrees with me on the whole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take a major national
company to show some leadership and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're not going to continue to
follow this insane federal law when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have half of the states have legal
cannabis in some form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one of the things I've
liked about your campaign for end the
[SPEAKER_02]: social cannabis, because you always tag
whatever platform it's on, Zuckerberg
[SPEAKER_02]: himself, and you run the campaign as if
you're in conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be so visionary if he would just
step out and magnanimously change the
[SPEAKER_02]: policy, regardless of what his attorneys
are saying, and instead just be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: right side of history, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: A girl can dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that when you tag him in
these posts that you've never gotten a
[SPEAKER_02]: response, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my website's been visited a number
of times from Palo Alto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, someone may be looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten a response though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me say that, you know,
I have a lot of admiration for Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Zuckerberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a true visionary and I have created a
career out of social media and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does some incredible work and is
causing these wonderful shifts in our
[SPEAKER_00]: culture that allow us to create community
around brands and community around causes
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that we sort of lost as a
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, there's plenty of people
that comment on my stuff negatively about
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Zuckerberg, but I don't approach the
conversation as that adversarial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that he is a leader and I think
that it would be amazing if he could go
[SPEAKER_00]: down in history and help, you know,
shifting to the end of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's a really good
clarification to make too, because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so often trolls will put
comments like, you know, screw Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: Zuckerberg or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, you know, I've got friends
that I'm friendly with and we have dinner
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have, you know, disagreeing
political positions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean I dislike the person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means that I, you know,
I would encourage or educate them to
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially change their position or not,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's a really responsible
position to take to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a difference between the human and the
implementation of a policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, during the first set,
you were talking about how two similar
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising buys were treated differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was from CNN and one was from the
media personality that was trying to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: on their own as an individual citizen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that CNN, theirs got approved and the
individual persons did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see a lot of that kind of
favoritism taking place by people who have
[SPEAKER_02]: got PR departments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times has five and a half million
followers on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a small business that
maybe has 1,300 followers or 13,000
[SPEAKER_00]: followers and they get shut down,
they don't have the resources or the clout
[SPEAKER_00]: to appeal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a major national name and you're
having problems with Facebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, they're going to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when these small players, and in
cannabis, it's a lot of small players.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this huge entrepreneurial
environment, so many startups and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people spending scarce resources to build
a brand, to build a company, to advocate
[SPEAKER_00]: for a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they invest a lot of time in building
these communities and then they just get
[SPEAKER_00]: yanked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they literally have no recourse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not unfamiliar with the
rumor and I'm hoping that you can tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: to what degree you think it's true that
these small players in these new markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got a competitor and so they get
everybody at their business and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: their friends to go and click the button,
is this offensive or illegal to our
[SPEAKER_02]: guidelines button?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all turn in one company's page to
try to get rid of their competitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if this is urban myth or
not, but have you heard about this
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy working?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that you're seeing
happen with you and your clients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard of this and I think that
anyone who's an ethical and responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: business owner would not pursue that
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a good product and a
good cause, you don't need to attack your
[SPEAKER_00]: competition that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just be able to focus on your
message and build following that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that sort of underscores that that is
a perversion of the reporting mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we simply had terms of service that
were more clear and provided us a
[SPEAKER_00]: framework that we could abide by,
then there wouldn't be that weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, perversion that allows people to
attack each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's probably got to be
the most frustrating aspect of all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: is that, you know, not that they're not
allowing cannabis while that is
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that we don't know where anybody is
drawing the lines and the lines are being
[SPEAKER_02]: drawn differently for big companies versus
small companies, potentially by who the
[SPEAKER_02]: reviewer is of the ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you've told me about, you know,
when you press an ad, sometimes they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: flip-flop their opinion and they're like,
oh, that was a mistake, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is not the way to make social
policy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not allow marketing teams and
advocates to plan out a media campaign
[SPEAKER_02]: that is strong and will have good reach,
but also meets the Facebook guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that moving target is probably
what really annoys people the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they lose money because of it,
because you can't have a plan and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't execute with consistency if you have
a morbid target like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's guesswork all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would think that right now,
coming up to the elections, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably a lot, what are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nine states that are looking to
move towards normalization and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably very actively trying to educate
via Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a total mess about which ads
are going to be allowed and from state to
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are people reaching out to you to,
you know, share their stories with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you seeing on the front lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm so glad you asked this because I
do have people reach out to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly, I would like to see more
people reach out to me because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency as to what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ads get denied and people appeal them and
they sit in purgatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just decided that I'm have to
serve as the watchdog for this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people have something that's
denied, I love when they send me a screen
[SPEAKER_00]: grab of their original post and then a
screen grab of the reason which they were
[SPEAKER_00]: denied, which is often for promoting
illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's incredibly helpful to the cause
because we're helping generate a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that we can look for patterns
of inconsistency and help make the case to
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Zuckerberg that look, this needs to
be addressed because we are just lost
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't follow any reasonable rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think having a, having community
support is essential to advancing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope anyone out there would tag me on
Instagram with a post.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can DM me on Facebook or Instagram
with these examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially on my Instagram at Rise
Above Social, you'll see examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: People reach out to me and someone got
shut down and I like to profile that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not about Rise Above Social.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about the community and these
small businesses that are taking a hit
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this inconsistent policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look inside this crystal ball with me for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking just a couple months into the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing the future of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show sure has grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've continued to interview fascinating
cannabis industry luminaries and our
[SPEAKER_02]: audience has gotten huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has doubled and redoubled and doubled
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are high fives all around the
Shaping Fire world headquarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: New listeners are subscribing every day
and begin to listen to the back catalog of
[SPEAKER_02]: all the great interviews there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is where the Shaping Fire
audience learns about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were incredibly smart today to become
an early adopter and place a commercial in
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire's early episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, today, you are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: pay a fraction of the cost we'll be asking
in just two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, all the audience that listens to
our back catalog of interviews will hear
[SPEAKER_02]: about your company again and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
so new.
[SPEAKER_02]: But take advantage of the huge listening
audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: This crystal ball is not a smoke dream.

[SPEAKER_02]: advertising.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Lauren Gibbs of Rise Above
[SPEAKER_02]: Social Strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we have kind of
brought this to a crescendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are cannabis companies that are
getting their pages yanked from them and
[SPEAKER_02]: going back to their first like again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's advocacy at both the state and
federal level that's being shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one knows why because there's no
shared guidelines and we all just assume
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's because the Facebook and
Instagram lawyers are playing very serious
[SPEAKER_02]: defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that since you started the
End the Social Cannabin, you've taken this
[SPEAKER_02]: up as an activist yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you probably see what our path would
look like to get their attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get this changed, Lauren?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's one thing that Mark
Zuckerberg certainly pays attention to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's community metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when things get shared, in a phenomenal
way, that garners attention from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can increase the organic reach,
meaning the unpaid reach of all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: messages for this campaign, we can help
get attention from him because all we want
[SPEAKER_00]: is for him to have a conversation with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to be able to speak to
Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that this inconsistent policy is
affecting small businesses and advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just want to have that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So individuals can be very helpful to that
by helping share these posts, tag us in
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of censorship, share our posts,
spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every like, share, and comment counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're saying sharing,
you're talking about specifically sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: posts that include the hashtag and the
social cannabin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about sharing posts from
one of your social media profiles so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the profile gets more attention?
[SPEAKER_02]: What specifically do you want people to
share to increase the metrics so that
[SPEAKER_02]: Zuckerberg pays more attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think telling your own story with the
hashtag is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have experienced censorship
yourself, I really want to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: story, how that affected you and your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And add the end of social cannabin hashtag
so that I can track those conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those conversations and
stories are going to be worth
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you use the hashtag, that allows
me, especially on Instagram, that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: me to track that conversation and find
those stories and share them, lift them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them a larger platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, you know, after they may have
been blocked from their 12,000 followers
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're starting with five followers,
it's hard for them to get that story out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tag me and I'll help you get that
story out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on Facebook, you know,
I post a lot of educational content about
[SPEAKER_00]: why this matters, examples of the
censorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of censorship in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sharing those posts is important
because it helps everyone educate their
[SPEAKER_00]: own personal networks about why this is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the more people that care,
the more likely we are to bring about
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any examples of this happening
with another industry or community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody ever, you know, pushed and
engaged Facebook because of their
[SPEAKER_02]: sidelines?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's an example of somebody who won
doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, Facebook used to
censor photos of women breastfeeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would get flagged for nudity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a grassroots movement on
this where women changed their profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: their public profile pictures to the photo
of them breastfeeding their child.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got a lot of attention and Facebook
actually changed their policy on nudity
[SPEAKER_00]: such that photos of breastfeeding and post
mastectomy surgical photos are allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They listened to a community and there was
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just want to be next.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like a pretty reasonable
request, especially since you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily demanding a change in the
policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking for a conversation to figure
out what the policy even is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you mentioned a couple of
times during our talk that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: people who have had their pages spiked or
taken away, but then they've gotten them
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that we've got a business
owner or an advocate who's listening and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes soon their page is gone and it
says because they're violating guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should they do to try to get their
page back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, honestly, it's a whack-a-mole
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say file an appeal, but it's
probably going to end up in purgatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: What most businesses do is they just set
up another account and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may hear in a couple of months a
response to your appeal and your page is
[SPEAKER_00]: back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the problem of having to
reconcile two Instagram accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's happened to
Carl Reifer several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had several accounts shut down after
over 100,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she pops up another one and pick up
15,000 in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she gets a notice later that her
page was restored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, well, I just spent all
this time cultivating a new community over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I get this back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a waste of resources for so many
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't sound like there's actually
an elegant solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your page gets dropped, you're just
hosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really isn't a way to appeal that is
timely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as business people or advocates,
we just have to keep on moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't sound like there's really
any way to stay on their good side.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in cannabis in any way and even
reporting cannabis news, you could end up
[SPEAKER_02]: being a target.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, that's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of folks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some other social media folks
will advise to avoid the use of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: keywords.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even that is not always a foolproof
plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we wrap up, one of the important
things is for everybody in the scene to be
[SPEAKER_02]: motivated and activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are starting to think,
oh, cannabis is legal in my state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are starting to shift more
towards the business side than the
[SPEAKER_02]: advocacy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the country is still not
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they are moving towards
normalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we as cannabis enthusiasts all need
to raise our hand to be proud of what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're involved with and to make our voice
heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you say is the best actions
that an individual person can do to make
[SPEAKER_02]: their voice heard and to feed you
situations that you can use in building a
[SPEAKER_02]: case for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are some of the tips, tips,
and tricks for evolving these guidelines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what individuals can absolutely do
is share these stories with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, sending those screen grabs of
your original post and your denial
[SPEAKER_00]: notification by DM to me on Facebook or
Instagram is incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, I have been talking openly
to Mark Zuckerberg for a long time now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I haven't gotten a response yet,
so I can't guarantee to anyone that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gonna cause a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by contributing their story to what
I'm doing, it's gonna help elevate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need points of evidence to make this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them to pay attention and have this
dialogue with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's all hidden right now,
and if they can share that information
[SPEAKER_00]: with me and these stories, we can have a
more informed dialogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we've all learned is that
crowdsourcing money or ideas or political
[SPEAKER_02]: influence, it's the way of the future,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big corporations can ignore individuals
and even small groups, but when we band
[SPEAKER_02]: together, we've got a voice that they have
to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, and that is the point of
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make the kind of impact that you
never could make in the past because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can spread things and share things so
quickly with your network.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I want to use this platform
to change this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's work together to make this change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Lauren, what can businesses do to be
supportive of this and to help pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook for guidelines without putting
themselves at too much risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's an inherent risk every day
when you're operating on social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get shut down at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accepting that is just part of
operating cannabis business on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I invite business owners to be a part
of this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I approached Willie's Reserve about
supporting the end of social cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we discussed that this is something that
could bring some additional attention from
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook and Instagram to their accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, the answer came down that
they follow the guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would Willie do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Willie always stands up for what he
thinks is right and joins the cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's not popular, even if it's
risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only by joining our voices together as
business owners can we really make a
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm so happy to have companies like
Willie's Reserve on board and supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of this important conversation.
