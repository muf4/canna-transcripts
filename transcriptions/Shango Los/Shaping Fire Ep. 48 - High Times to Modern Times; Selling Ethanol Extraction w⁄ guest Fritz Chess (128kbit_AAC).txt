[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis freedom spread around the US
and the world, new, shiny, and expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: brands are being established to conduct
the commerce of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though there's a huge amount of
business risk to opening a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: company, the likelihood that you might
catch a case and go to prison is greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though we should pause for a moment to
remember that people are still very much
[SPEAKER_00]: going to jail for the plant, and that
needs to stop immediately everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in states with at least a medical
cannabis program, you can usually run your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business within the regulatory
structure without getting busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was certainly not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks who have come to cannabis in the
last decade or so kind of always have had
[SPEAKER_00]: the expectation that it would be legal in
the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as recently as the 1990s, you could go
to very real prison for not a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was no end in sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, there have always been those who
were studying, breeding, conducting
[SPEAKER_00]: science, and inventing devices for the
cultivation and processing of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This global fellowship of botanical
experts developed specialty knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: traded it amongst themselves while staying
in the shadows and just out of reach of
[SPEAKER_00]: the muggles.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,

[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Fritz Chess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fritz is founder of Eden Labs,
maker of some of the most advanced and
[SPEAKER_00]: relied upon cannabis extraction
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't really be talking tech with Fritz
today, nor really about the modern Eden
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Fritz to talk about the early
days of selling extraction technology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of High Times Magazine and what
hurdles he had to cross trying to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction tech and connect with
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Fritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad that you share some of your
valuable time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were first selling ethanol
extraction equipment, it was in the back
[SPEAKER_00]: of High Times Magazine, and in those days,
cannabis, of course, was still very much
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, and yet High Times was exerting
pressure against prohibition simply by
[SPEAKER_00]: existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, to what degree did it feel
like you were getting away with something
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, being able to advertise your
ethanol extractors in the magazine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we definitely felt like we were
getting away with something because here's
[SPEAKER_02]: how it all happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before us and Eden Labs, way back in the
70s, there was the ISO II extractor that
[SPEAKER_02]: was made by a guy named DJ Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to give him some props,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But second of all, we studied what
happened with him, and he was openly
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising it as a way of extracting
cannabis and peyote buttons were two of
[SPEAKER_02]: his main focuses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the DEA shut him down fairly quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked to a lawyer, and basically,
he said, you have to have a disclaimer
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's not for illegal use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we turned that into a tongue-in-cheek
marketing pitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the picture in High Times showed our
original little cold finger home unit,
[SPEAKER_02]: and up at the top, it said, warning,
not intended for illegal use, which was a
[SPEAKER_02]: roundabout way of saying, hey,
you can make ash oil with this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody got it, and they started
selling pretty well right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of this was my idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend, someone I'm still good
friends with who already was selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the one that developed the products
for passing the urine tests, a company
[SPEAKER_02]: called Clear Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he approached me.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, he asked me for one of these
extractors because he knew I had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made him one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, can you make these?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can sell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I can make them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you think there's a market
for herbal extractors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, let's find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he had me make 10 of them,
and he put that ad in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no looking back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They immediately started selling really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no surprise there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that technology probably blew
people's minds that it was going to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to extract to oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember how much the original
price point was?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that little home unit sold for
like $150 back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one unit we still make now that we
came out with shortly after the home unit,
[SPEAKER_02]: we called it the professional six liter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started out at $900.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $3,600 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, glass and glass blowers pricing
has gone way, way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never really was marking it up quite
enough back then to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your buddy comes to you and he says,
hey, you've got these extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if there's a market for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you have the extractor already?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, were you making these in your
garage like R&D style because you were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your own extractions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were you already in a related business,
but you just weren't selling to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: folk?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what actually started the company,
I mean, I was making various kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal extracts, including cannabis,
but basically just the super old school
[SPEAKER_02]: method of grinding some herb, putting it
in a jar, like a spaghetti jar or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, and with alcohol or vodka and
shaking it up and straining it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Draining it off in a funnel and cooking
out the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like a crude still that I used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I just made them for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I started making extractors
is because the one herb I wanted to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with, Cava Cava, was extremely difficult
to extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just not extract putting it in
jars of ethanol or vodka.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came up with this distillation
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that worked really well for the Cava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there wouldn't even be an Eden Labs
if it wasn't for Cava Cava, because
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis was easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put it in a jar with some alcohol
and shake it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we didn't realize how easy
it was back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were still shaking it for days on end
when really all I had to do was pour it in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and shake it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what year are we talking about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1994, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So High Times Magazine has always been
kind of like a counterculture bastion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they provide a lot of cover for a lot
of folks with their own legal department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was High Times very open to sharing that
umbrella protection that was provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: their legal team for a certain extent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were they very much, we're giving you a
place to market your mostly illegal goods
[SPEAKER_00]: so you really owe us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm trying to get at, were they
easy to work with back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they trying to encourage your sales?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, I didn't deal with
High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that friend, Latha Dodd,
who he was the one that marketed those
[SPEAKER_02]: through High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wholesaling them to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a website very close very early
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by 96, I had a website and we were
selling them here and there, but that was
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly Cava industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cava had really was a hot herb in the
mid and late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was mostly dealing with Cava
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Latha was handling the cannabis,
but I think High Times was pretty easy for
[SPEAKER_02]: him to get along with because he was doing
giant full page ads every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like people who are making them
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing they wouldn't do is we kept
badgering them to do an article about our
[SPEAKER_02]: extractors and they just wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was because of liability
and what happened with DJ Gold back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, crap, I can't think of his
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, Ed called me outside of High
Times having nothing to do with High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: and he bought what we call the four liter
apothecary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which we still sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he and I went over on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught him how to carbon filter to get
the green out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ed was using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the 90s, probably 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must have been pretty excited slash
startled when the ad ran and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: order started coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they jumping out of your workshop as
soon as the ad ran?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the ad was in there every
month, probably from 96 till Bush got
[SPEAKER_02]: elected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I shut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, we can't be advertising and had
high times with this new regime,
[SPEAKER_02]: which actually, you know, Michael Kennedy,
who owned High Times, I talked to him
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe five years ago at a cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me that I did the right thing
because a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: got raided real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they started that operation,
I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of the name, but it was
operation something or other where they
[SPEAKER_02]: were raiding everybody that was
advertising in High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like I got out of there in
the nick of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like a smart place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you got out, I would have
thought that the, you know, those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: who were advertising in High Times were
kind of like in a secret club,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, there was pretty much
nowhere else in the country that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get away with advertising like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you were in it, you know,
selling items that were, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: for tobacco use only or as your as yours
was, you know, definitely not for illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of I would think it set up like a
secret club of you folks who were who were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you did was there camaraderie between
the advertisers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who were who were pulling this hustle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were you all just kind of like working
in your own worlds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Laith probably knew a lot more of
those people than I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only knew one guy and he was actually in
Columbus, Ohio, where I lived at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sold glass pipes and bongs and he
didn't pull his ad and they came after
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He barely escaped and he went to Taiwan
and he didn't come back till Obama got
[SPEAKER_02]: elected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so it's interesting that you'd say,
OK, we we pulled our ad right as the Bush
[SPEAKER_00]: regime came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's odd, though, that they did not
go to old issues and find your ad and then
[SPEAKER_00]: raid you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever get contacted at all by law
enforcement at any time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Laith had a he had some some kind of
inquiry from the DEA at one point because
[SPEAKER_02]: someone got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they didn't really give him
a hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember exactly what they wanted
to know, but it would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty innocuous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of surprised they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't make any big deal about it at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were you were doing these other
extractions for Kava Kava and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were any of your other extractions,
you know, potentially running into legal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like you mentioned, D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold was doing peyote button extraction
and were you know, Kava Kava is legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though, you know, it certainly has
got some I don't know what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: medical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But were you extracting other controlled
substances as well or just cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, there were lots of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to go into all of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, let your imagination run
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I was going with that, though,
is, you know, we imagine that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like an international club of of
people who are experts in their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like at that time you were
probably an expert in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly on the forefront of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wondered if other people from,
you know, who were developing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: extractors or from other countries who
were trying to solve extraction problems
[SPEAKER_00]: was the you know, in an Internet world,
this all became very, very easy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the in those days, you had to,
you know, either write letters or travel
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did people reach out to you because they
wanted to connect with you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and when it came to to
cannabis, there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: before Bush, when Clinton was still
president, I would say that San Francisco
[SPEAKER_02]: was the epicenter of the whole,
you know, cannabis processing and new
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put we put all kinds of extractors
and not the very first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Dennis Perrone and his didn't
last too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the very second one was on Market
Street in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the second dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had, you know, an older version of
the ethanol extractor distiller that we
[SPEAKER_02]: sell to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my very first CO2 unit that we ever
built, he rented it for a little while and
[SPEAKER_02]: we we used it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time I'd ever put,
you know, good quality product in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in Ohio, basically,
I'd give people to give me bags of leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, obviously it wasn't as good
a quality as what came out from primo buds
[SPEAKER_02]: coming down to the Bay from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were people even thinking about doing
whole plant extractions at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my mind, and certainly I don't
I don't go back as far as you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my mind, you know, people have just
been using trim for extraction until just
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, four or five years ago
when when the prices dropped and people
[SPEAKER_00]: realized how much better extractions were
from from, you know, doing nug runs versus
[SPEAKER_00]: doing trim runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you actually have people back in the
in the mid late 90s who were doing full
[SPEAKER_00]: flower runs?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did full flower in the CO2 unit at that
at that shop and on Market Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the name of it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, you know, everybody was just
doing you know, sometimes it wasn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, obviously it was pretty low
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody knew what waxes were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did figure out how to carbon filter
early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at least getting the
chlorophyll out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big innovation at that time,
because I don't know if you've ever smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: that old school Jamaican hash oil that was
blackish green.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who you can imagine what that tasted
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that stuff was really bitter because
there were so many fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting you're getting a lot of
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it got my attention when you
said that you you taught Ed how to filter
[SPEAKER_00]: through carbon to get rid of the
chlorophyll that would clean up a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's product right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was a major step right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it wasn't for some years
later that we realized that we could drop
[SPEAKER_02]: waxes out just, you know, when it came out
of the cold finger extractor, it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to carbon filter first and
get rid of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, wax won't drop out when
there's still chlorophyll in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, then we figured out after a
while, you know, part of it was us
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we figured out we could just put that
in the freezer for a little while and drop
[SPEAKER_02]: that wax out and then really bring out the
flavor a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, you know, you were
working with your business partner and you
[SPEAKER_00]: were feeding him extractors to sell
through the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were also having these other
extractors for various other herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you, you know, were you take were you
going to trade shows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, they weren't cannabis trade shows
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you go to herbalist trade shows
and you were bringing this gear out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the natural products show,
which is in Anaheim every March.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to we used to do that show a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably know where I'm going with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're at these shows, there are
probably people who who, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they were doing lavender for their
business, but at home they had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get people coming up to you at the
shows with the nod, nod, wink,
[SPEAKER_00]: wink?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this be used for other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you had to be very careful with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were pretty discreet about it,
probably not as much when Clinton was
[SPEAKER_02]: president.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't worry about it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, I was a lot more
careful than now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when when when Bush got elected,
it was don't ask, don't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if if someone it was real typical
back then for someone from California to
[SPEAKER_02]: call up and just start running their
mouths, basically say it's legal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're you know, we're licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can we can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd start talking about and I'd
say, no, it's you know, I'm in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you were calling me up,
I'd hint strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say like if you were calling me up
about extracting some ginseng,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't help you, you know,
with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it was basically like,
you know, don't be stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe you want to call me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm pretty sure some of
them did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was definitely a don't ask,
don't tell policy till basically till
[SPEAKER_02]: after Obama got elected and Holder had
that press conference in 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then then, you know, the Pandora's box
opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me a lot of back when I was
in college and we would go to head shops
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, the signs would say for
tobacco use only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd be asking for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to be very careful what you
asked the employees for, because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: used any of their keywords, they'd say,
sorry, you have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, they get and they get real
shitty about it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They throw you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're put that, you know,
they were you were putting them at risk
[SPEAKER_00]: and pissing them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people think of those little glass
bowls with the crown off as a crack pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, they were a hash oil pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, crack didn't come out to the
early 80s, but there was always the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: oil pipes in the head shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they weren't common.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had to tell people to ask for the
tobacco oil pipe and which was a new
[SPEAKER_02]: phrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the head shops got it right
away because there had always been,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, that nasty Jamaican hash oil
that came around, you know, starting way
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were a few people,
you know, making hash oil with D.J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold's instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to picture this utensil that
you're describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it was it kind of like a glass spoon
that you would light with a butane lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom so that the flame did not
actually come in contact with the hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was more like a glass fishbowl with
an open hole in the top and a stem that
[SPEAKER_02]: came off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'd drip the oil down in there
and then you'd hold a lighter to the
[SPEAKER_02]: underside and smoke it, you know,
the same way people smoke crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, it's not really a crack
pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was an oil pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it all started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when you would go to these trade
shows and you were selling to these these
[SPEAKER_00]: these other types of herbalists,
did you find that you started selling
[SPEAKER_00]: these to people who were using them for
cannabis more than you were selling them
[SPEAKER_00]: to people for regular herbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get an idea of of how many
people may or how significant the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who were buying your product for
its cannabis purpose versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a traditional herbal purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of my original sponsors or
backers was a guy here in Seattle who,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he was a big kava importer,
of course, going back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was in the natural products
industry and he was friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never met people like this hippies
that were multimillionaires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Millionaire business people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of that, those those natural
product companies or herbal companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, were started with the proceeds
from, you know, cannabis importation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of these guys were super familiar
and they all got high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, their businesses were
selling medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, all his friends bought these
units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty sure they were mostly just
doing hash oil with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, people were kind of
secretive back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't hear a whole lot about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, that was my impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was actually a pretty nice
setup you had where you got to build the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine, which was your passion,
and then and then have your your friend be
[SPEAKER_00]: more the face of the company, which gave
you an extra level of security while you
[SPEAKER_00]: were still able to, you know, not only
make the profit, but have your hand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene, which, you know,
even though it was dangerous, there it
[SPEAKER_00]: also was a, you know, kind of a rite of
passage to be a bit of an outlaw back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you said is is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting back to to the culture and,
you know, people reaching out by the time
[SPEAKER_02]: Bush got elected, the whole epicenter
shifted to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that same friend had a condo in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he and I got kind of initiated into the
VIP area upstairs above Blunt Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody listening is going
to remember Blunt Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a it was kind of an Amsterdam
style coffee shop in Vancouver back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could smoke in there and they had
coffee and sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so upstairs was kind of where,
you know, the illuminati of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry often hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was meeting big growers and
exporters and importers and people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were innovating, you know, with
extractions and stuff that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the early 2000s or, you know,
from from basically from like 99 on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they got Stephen Harper and we
got Obama.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything shifted back to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask you more questions
about that, that international cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: illuminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go ahead and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Fritz Chest,
founder of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes and custom terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: blends.

terpene blends are tested to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: demanding worldwide safety and stability
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes from true terpenes are third
party tested, non-GMO and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're triple distilled, making them the
purest terpenes available in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over a thousand terpene isolates,
strain profiles and terp flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be sure that true terpenes will
have the perfect aromatics for your
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also offers custom blending
so that you can match your company's
[SPEAKER_00]: marquee strains across all your product

[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes that you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: to your oil or edible or capsule or
beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.

[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators though,
building their greenhouse before gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into how cannabis greenhouses
differ from ornamental crops can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California but expanding over the last
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: to helping clients throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness in
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some it is improper ventilation
planning, for others it is surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of the building or the
plant's leaves or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit greenhouseadvisorygroup.com to learn
more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Fritz Chess,
founder of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break we were talking about
the early days of Eden Labs and
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising in High Times Magazine and
what it was like to be selling an
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor that could be used for cannabis
during serious prohibition days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then things started transitioning
with the Obama administration and the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: started loosening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Perrone was running the Cannabis
Buyers Club on Market, which luckily I was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to check out there in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were starting to understand
that cannabis had legitimate medical uses
[SPEAKER_00]: and things started to loosen up,
at least for people who were HIV positive
[SPEAKER_00]: and for people who wanted to do R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, Fritz, you were
talking about how above Blunt Brothers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver, the international cannabis
illuminati, were able to get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk safely and bluntly and exchange
information in ways that we take for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted now due to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in those days, you actually still had
to physically get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As somebody who was an extraction engineer
like yourself and you're meeting these
[SPEAKER_00]: international cannabis players,
did folks start to consult you or try to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach you or recruit you to, for example,
go to Amsterdam and build out machines or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were people trying to involve your
expertise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a lot of talk of me moving
to Vancouver and setting up an operation
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually came very close to doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only reason it didn't happen
was all of a sudden I got a giant project
[SPEAKER_02]: building multiple CO2 extractors for some
scientists down in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just kind of kept me in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did move to Vancouver,
but yeah, it was at one point it was all
[SPEAKER_02]: arranged.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had growers that were gonna give me
trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a place to set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Blunt Brothers that it was all gonna
move through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I was, I came very close to
moving to Vancouver and just being one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the earliest large scale ash oil makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like even though you weren't
actually making the oil yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like you still, even though you
moved back to the US, you were still a
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious player.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't actually just doing the
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were actually creating the means of
production though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you moved back to the United
States doesn't mean that you gave up your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand on the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was doing then what I'm doing now is
I run the R&D department at Eden Labs and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was always doing extractions and
trying new stuff, but I wasn't doing toll
[SPEAKER_02]: processing for people, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as kind of a sidebar, I wanna talk
about the vocabulary that's been used
[SPEAKER_00]: historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, a lot of people like to use the
term EHO, ethanol hash oil, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't even know what EHO is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of us still use the shorthand
for RSO, Rick Simpson oil, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: people know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though Rick Simpson wasn't the
person who first did these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions, he's certainly one of the
people who made it more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the early to mid 90s when
you were bringing these first extractors
[SPEAKER_00]: to market, what was the vocabulary people
were using to refer to a clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a hash oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you see, if at all,
that vocabulary change over the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was just simply called hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there weren't a lot of options or a
lot of, there weren't all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: manifestations or varieties that you have
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was almost all alcohol extracts
that were carbon filtered and just put in
[SPEAKER_02]: little vials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the early days, the main market was
deadheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else was interested in hash oil,
but the deadhead community and those who
[SPEAKER_02]: traveled following the dead, they loved
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the BHO came along very soon
after I started doing the cold fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of really, that was really
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who invented it, but the guys
who popularized it was a psilocybe
[SPEAKER_02]: fanaticists that were down out of Olympia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they developed the easy method
of growing shrooms and they had the
[SPEAKER_02]: original, you know, BHO, you know,
blaster units that they, they sold out of
[SPEAKER_02]: high times, but yeah, they didn't last all
that long because not only were they
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising, you know, those things at a
high times, but they were, making mass
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of hash oil and growing many,
many pounds of shrooms openly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got in a lot of trouble and they
might still be in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting that the first units
that were being sold were, were open
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting and, and not closed loop at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my God, talk about a dangerous
product in the wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course there was, there was them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the honeybee came out,
which I think oddly is still around,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the honeybee was kind of the main
instrument that people started,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, buying to do hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you saw those in head shops way
back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with it, with the name of that product
being the honeybee, it kind of speaks back
[SPEAKER_00]: to my question about vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was, was the term honey oil being used to
refer to the ethanol hash oil as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were people who argued that
point way back then because the honey oil
[SPEAKER_02]: was supposed to be really top notch stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the best hash oil I ever
saw, like way back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew this guy in college who got on a
plane, flew to Nepal, bought tons of hash
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, stuffed it in condoms, swallowed
them, came back to campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can, you know how he got
them back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that, and that stuff was all over
campus for like a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this beautiful pinkish red
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm pretty sure it was actually
extracted from high quality hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably with ether, which is,
you know, an older method that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think too many people do anymore,
but that was the true, that was the true
[SPEAKER_02]: honey oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't going to make a product like
that extracting fan leaves with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that, that, that person who flew
to Nepal was probably a superhero on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus there for awhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it obviously had a big influence on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, when you can, when you can get
the oil straight and not have to smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material as well, it's a,
it's a really different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting too, that you would
mention that the oil kind of traveled with
[SPEAKER_00]: a deadhead family too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I'm a deadhead and followed there
in the, you know, the mid nineties for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only place that I ever saw
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when we toured,
you would run into it in the parking lot
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, where I went to school in
Indianapolis at Butler university,
[SPEAKER_00]: it only ever, you, you only ever really
saw it in Indianapolis, uh, in my circles
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, was right after shows at deer
Creek, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody would go to the shows and,
and you'd buy some and then you'd have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it was all gone in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, but if you paid attention,
like when the dead came through town,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get some of these exotic things
like, like California kind buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the back in those days,
we were all smoking Mexican brick weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stuff would come from California
and then eventually became BC bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I mean, that was exotic stuff,
but it was cause it was traveling with
[SPEAKER_00]: heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably, I mean, some of that hash oil
you might've gotten it at deer Creek would
[SPEAKER_02]: be from guys I knew who were down at
Athens at Ohio university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that stuff would,
would get unloaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did shows at, uh, at Buckeye lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some good shows there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think that it traveled with the
dead heads because the, the parking lot
[SPEAKER_00]: market was so easy to work in because the,
the heads were so happy to buy it or
[SPEAKER_00]: because the extractors themselves were
dead heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a little bit of both,
but, um, it just seemed like the dead
[SPEAKER_02]: heads were, were hip to it real early on
and liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they appreciated, you know,
how high it got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of my tricks back in the early
days, before anybody even knew what this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff was is I, you know, I, I'd put the
oil on the inside of a rolling paper and
[SPEAKER_02]: roll up just a joint of, you know,
Mexican, cause that was what was around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, 10 people would get high on
that joint and they'd be just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what in the world was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, you know, they didn't even know
what hash oil was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they might want to get a
little vile of it, but yeah, I,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, back then I always wondered why aren't
people more into extracts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just sheer lack of availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the price point like on that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, I saw anywhere from 20
to $50 a gram back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would have been, you know,
just, uh, extracted from trimmer leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon filtered ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Removed, but you know, obviously plenty of
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but you know, there were no analytics
and they'd just be in the little glass
[SPEAKER_02]: vials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that the, uh,
the price point has stayed essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: same and what has gotten better is the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but the price point is about the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let, let's, uh, kind of as a side note,
you know, a lot of people, when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about RSO, um, they'll,
they'll talk about how Rick Simpson
[SPEAKER_00]: popularized it, but that you really didn't
want to use his method because he
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged the use of naphtha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were in the scene before Rick was
popularized and you're in the scene after
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick was popularized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything to share about what
it was like to be there as the,
[SPEAKER_00]: as, as Rick and his method became
popularized and then, and then people
[SPEAKER_00]: started to move away from it because of
the naphtha and choosing ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if you, you were there,
so if, if you have any stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a short story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he called me probably,
you know, 99 or 2000 or I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly, but about, you know, back around
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of admonished him for pushing
this naphtha thing and told him he should
[SPEAKER_02]: be using ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure what happened after that,
but it was, you know, not too long after
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that everybody called, ethanol
extract RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to my knowledge, he was, if you watch
his videos, he was still promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: naphtha, not ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, uh, I don't know exactly,
you know, what the story was with him,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I, you know, my, my knowledge was it
was always naphtha, but somehow ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: extract became RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can, maybe you know more about
it than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I actually, I actually don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all I know is just, uh,
you know, second, fourth, fifth hand that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, the naphtha was popularized
because it was a good solvent and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just had to make sure that you
purged it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then that, that, that skill and
that equipment was so much harder to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that people just naturally moved to
ethanol because it was easier to get.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes so much safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, to, to finish up on the kind of
international Illuminati thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, had you, I mean, other than going to
Vancouver, uh, which is certainly another
[SPEAKER_00]: country, had you started traveling
internationally at this point to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet with other, you know, minds in
Amsterdam to talk about technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: processes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, uh, my partner, you know,
at the time that I've talked about Leith,
[SPEAKER_02]: he went to Amsterdam on a number of
occasions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I've, I've been friends with
Donnie Werkshafter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm guessing you know who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, he and I are both from
Ohio and, uh, you know, he has that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that permaculture preserve down in Belize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've hung out down there with him for like
a month in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I've, I've known him from
environmental activism since I was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in my late twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, the, the main person I kept in
touch with about what the scene was and
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was going was Donnie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because I just see him in Columbus
bouncing around town.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, we had all the same friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really, I mean, he really does have
a great Rolodex of international
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he, he would have to have that
just to be able to pull together a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the artifacts that he keeps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's more connected than Donnie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let's go ahead and take our,
our second break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we come back, let's talk
about, uh, uh, the, the, the changing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the guard and, and the, the eventual
decrease of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so we're going to take our short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Fritz Chest,
founder of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields, and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out-competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_00]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative
and polyculture cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agrawal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome, and Jeff Loewenfels on
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, and even my own
presentation on how to approach finding
[SPEAKER_00]: your dream job in cannabis and why we
choose cannabis business even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks are so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there are over 100 videos
that you can check out for absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: free.

or click on the link in this week's
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Fritz Chess, founder of Eden
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were just coming
up to the changing of the vibe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States where people were surviving
the Republican administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone had scurried back underground
after the Clinton years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that change was coming with the Obama
administration, and Dennis Perrone was
[SPEAKER_00]: making massive changes in California,
and people were starting to see cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in a slightly different light than they
did with the reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fritz, there must have been a point for
you after President Obama came into office
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're all like, okay, things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can start to expand our services and
change our messaging a little bit to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out to new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that point for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it happened very suddenly and kind
of unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Holder had that press conference,
I think in 2010, where he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to let states do what they
want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly took note of that,
but I had no idea how significant that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happened was Eden Labs had built
a fish oil extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In particular, it was extracting Omega-3
oils from Greenland New Zealand mussels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these two New Zealand brothers had
this company down in Orange County in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had been setting up that extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we finished, my buddy Fred and I
just decided to go to Venice Beach for a
[SPEAKER_02]: few days and party, have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got up there, we were just
shocked because it was right after that
[SPEAKER_02]: press conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the response was dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were giant billboards
everywhere with pot leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were just smoking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everywhere you walked around the
boardwalk, you could smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, you know, attractive women in
bikinis and rollerblades selling medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana cards, you know, right there by
Muscle Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then, my cell phone was the phone
number for Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it literally, when we got to Venice
Beach, my phone just started ringing like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's when it really took off,
was at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Holder's Talks, would you say that
within a week, your phone started to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it that fast?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say probably even the next day,
it started to ring more for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we decided pretty quick that it was OK
to talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, you know, what we're allowed to
do and say has always been an evolving
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we quickly segued away from
the don't ask, don't tell and started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a lot of direct marketing,
but certainly they come to the website and
[SPEAKER_02]: they call or email and we talk about it
openly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And up until that point, everybody had
just been buying our cold finger ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: distiller extractors to make oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But coinciding with Holder's press
conference was all the sudden everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted CO2 extractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just, you know, we went from
building one, two or three a year to
[SPEAKER_02]: building, you know, three a month,
five a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings up two different questions
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, is that, OK,
so if, you know, Holder makes his
[SPEAKER_00]: statement and you are immediately getting,
you know, calls, your pivot was from
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about other herbs and inferring
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you pivot to a medical at the time we
would call it medical marijuana language
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were using medical marijuana
language or were you still not quite up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, still not up to being that blunt
about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were pretty blunt about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did talk about it, you know,
mostly in medical terms for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, going by, you know, Dennis,
you remember Dennis Perrone's statement
[SPEAKER_02]: that all all cannabis use is medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of went with that philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to your idea that you were
safer because of Holder's statement,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, you know, you're making
some money and you are about to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: scale for real for what will become the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you, you know, did you were you
lawyered up at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we had we had a great lawyer back
then, the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he unfortunately, he had like a stroke
or an aneurysm in the middle of the night
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ian was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had great ideas for how to navigate
all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all worked out just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never nothing ever happened,
you know, for us to regret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's nice, too,
because the reason why I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: that is because, you know, it's always
nice for us to make decisions on our
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition and how we think the politics is
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on what the media is telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, have a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I want to shift gears a little bit
and talk a little bit about the tech
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you had the original
cold finger back there in the in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: to mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually made me happy to hear
that it's like the same name, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you still have the cold finger on
your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that it's evolved over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, this was this was like one
of your original kids, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to give you the floor and just
like hear you describe how the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: the art of ethanol extraction has evolved
from your early days to where it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that this might be a long
answer, but but I think that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to hear it, especially the the
extractors who are bothering to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you go over my head,
that's perfectly cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, if somebody were to ask
you from your from your early cold finger
[SPEAKER_00]: machines to the ethanol extractors that
you're selling now, what are the what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the main themes of evolution in the
technology that you've developed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, the big switch was
realizing how efficiently cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted with ultra cold ethanol that,
you know, there's a very rapid extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you do it right with
cold, you don't pull the wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull very little or no chlorophyll,
depending on what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us knew that back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my joke back then when it was,
you know, try to make a cup of tea with
[SPEAKER_02]: cold water, you know, I always believed
and, you know, chemists in general all
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that, you know, the solvent needed
to at least be room temperature warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was the warmer it was,
the better it was going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, generally, that's that's
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of cannabis, it just means
you're going to pull a lot of wax and
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the original extraction,
you're going back to the Jamaica thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always figured the way they made that
was they just throw a bunch of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: a big pot out in the woods and and,
you know, heat it with a fire and in a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of rum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was in Jamaica a few
years ago and these guys confirmed that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going from that, you know, the cold
finger was able to distill, redistilled
[SPEAKER_02]: the same ethanol through a basket of syrup
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a much more concentrated batch
right out of the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could you could switch it out
and put in a collection vessel and then
[SPEAKER_02]: distill the ethanol back out of it all in
one machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty evolved for the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's still a very useful
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to this day, we have contracts
making that kava kava for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's still the best method for that
because it's very exhaustive and kava is
[SPEAKER_02]: very difficult to extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, that's overkill for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I laugh about how long we
went not realizing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd have this little unit just distilling
and distilling for hours on end and
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the drips come out of the basket
and wait till they ran clear before we
[SPEAKER_02]: figured it was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in reality, it was probably
done in the first 10 or 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, we were just going hours
and hours to pull more wax and
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we eventually that was
figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the very earliest that I knew of doing
anything cold was actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were guys up in Canada in that VIP
room at Blunt Brothers, but they talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about doing it was it was never ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cold isopropyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I did that and it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did not like the idea of using
isopropyl any more than I liked the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of using naphtha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were very close to having this all
figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, nineteen ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a you know, we thought you had
to do it cold with isopropyl, not ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of missed the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, another 15 years went by or or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you know, in the last couple
of years, the cold ethanol thing is really
[SPEAKER_02]: caught on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the way we do it now is,
you know, we chill a big chamber of
[SPEAKER_02]: ethanol with a chiller or you can
jumpstart it just throwing dry ice in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we pump that and just spray it
over a basket, kind of like a giant coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: maker and then recirculate it for a little
while and then pump it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we don't pull any we don't
pull any wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're if you're content to not
grind it first, you won't pull any
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that means you only get 30 pounds in
that basket.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grind it, you get 70 pounds and
then you're going to pull a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we have these really
efficient and, you know, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: listening are familiar with the lenticular
filters and the plate filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just pump everything out of
the extractor right through that filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes out, you know, real pretty on
the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pulling a little chlorophyll is not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wax has always been the problem once
everybody realized they wanted to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're still trying to
improve the tech on that because cold
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling giant, you know, 100 gallon or 500
gallon chambers of ethanol down to minus
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 C or colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very expensive for the chillers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very expensive on your electric bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the holy grail now is to just be able
to do this at room temperature ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to put any cold or heat on
it and then be able to get that wax out
[SPEAKER_02]: with some kind of refining system that's a
lot more efficient than having to chill
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working with some of the biggest
refining and filtration companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: work in food and chemical process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got like four different projects
going at once right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing promise with a few of
them, but we haven't really hit on
[SPEAKER_02]: anything yet that's going to eliminate the
need for those chillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting that you said that,
you know, back in the day, things were
[SPEAKER_00]: being done at room temperature and then
things got really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to make the cost savings here,
you're trying to figure out a way to move
[SPEAKER_00]: back to room temperature, but then filter
after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you is when doing it at
room temperature, you get a darker product
[SPEAKER_00]: that many have called, you know,
green lion or green dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then that evolved to,
you know, using cold alcohol in the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer and the water in the actual frozen
flour material tends to stay in the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: material when it's all frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're adding, you know,
freezing temperatures alcohol to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen flour and going to do, you know,
a couple of quick rinses off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with this more of a
this beautiful amber golden tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of the kind of, you know,
what I now feel like is kind of the scary
[SPEAKER_00]: and bitter green dragon kind of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it moved, when the tincture or when
the extraction process moved to the cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: did that really get rid of a lot of the
need for the carbon filter at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was so much less chlorophyll
in that product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, depending on how you do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like you said, if you can freeze the
cannabis along with getting the ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: cold, that's an ideal way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that people are scaling up to huge
volumes, especially with hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: very few people are actually freezing the
cannabis first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just taking the cannabis and
they're getting the ethanol cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, it still does a much
better job than, you know, warm or room
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature ethanol, but to avoid
chlorophyll completely without and not
[SPEAKER_02]: cool the cannabis, you basically have to
not grind it, just put whole buds in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basket and then, you know, spray that
ethanol over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that still comes out, you know,
a nice golden color.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does using whole flower decrease your
yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that a lot of your trichomes
would be tucked on the interior of an
[SPEAKER_00]: unground flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it certainly washes all the
trichomes off, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 or 80% of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is that there is a cannabinoids
that are bound in a matrix of cellulose
[SPEAKER_02]: and wax down in the plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always more stark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're discovering to get
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the price of cannabis has dropped and
so abundant that a lot of times people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't care about good yields anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good product and an efficient,
scalable manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a question for you that I get
asked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people ask me how much THC or
whole plant cannabinoids can ethanol hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really sure what to tell them,
because, you know, when a patient has
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to me and we're talking about the
opposite of scaling here, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a patient who's at home who did
their summer grow and now they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: their, you know, ounce or whatever of
flower and they want to make their
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture as potent as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll take, you know, a half
gallon of cold alcohol and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: pour it over your flowers and you're
gonna, you know, shake that and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done, patients are like,
well, now I want to use some more fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get more fresh flower and then
they pour the already extracted into
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they always ask me, how many
times can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point is the ethanol saturated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not even sure if I'm using the
right vocabulary here, but I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: know where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain how to think about when
you know that you're ethanol is saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: and you really should not soak it anymore
and that product is done?
[SPEAKER_02]: So with our cold finger process where you
can just redistill clear alcohol through
[SPEAKER_02]: the material over and over again,
you can make extremely concentrated
[SPEAKER_02]: tinctures that, you know, literally what
chemists call bomb out, like it gets so
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated that it can't stay in the
solution anymore and it just starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: fall to the bottom of the extractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, or if you put it in a bottle,
you'll see that it's all bombing out and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just piles of, you know,
resin or oil down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never gonna get that from just
pouring cold ethanol over, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: making tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The typical way or the common way of
tincturing, just getting into herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: tradition is, you know, whatever jar of
herb you have, you pour ethanol in it
[SPEAKER_02]: till, you know, it's an inch or two above
the plant material and you shake it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's supposed to be the extraction
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, you know, let's say with cannabis,
you know, doing that method, you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: got, you know, an 80 or 90% of the oil out
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take that tincture and dump it over
fresh material again, your yield is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be a lot less the second time around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think it's gonna be more,
you know, 60%, 70% maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that number is gonna keep going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, you know, if your cannabis
is very abundant and you don't care,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could do it two or three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, each time you do that,
you're gonna pull less of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for and the terpenes from
that next batch and the batch after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna keep dropping 10 or 20%,
I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a perfect world, you'd love a,
you know, this person that we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about would want a solution where either
they do one wash, and then they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, distill off the alcohol,
and then they do another wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they, so that essentially you're
doing one-to-one for your maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if somebody is doing it more at scale,
your cold finger is actually doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing for you in a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think for people that want
really strong tinctures, that the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: finger is the best method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people who have businesses that
just do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not a real commonplace
thing, especially here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't allow alcohol-based tinctures,
so there's no business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I just know people who,
you know, they might be gray market,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're using cold fingers to extract
cannabis, and then they do a carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: filtration, drop the wax out, and then
just sell the product like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very nice product because if
you do it right, you know, if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: redistilling ethanol back out,
and you let the cold finger cool down
[SPEAKER_02]: before you open it up after an extraction,
your terpene profile is completely intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting a full spectrum whole
plant extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, you know, the real tincture
heads have noticed is that different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains have a particular taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's dependent on getting all the
wax and the chlorophyll out, and then that
[SPEAKER_02]: brings out the bouquet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people that are really into
it, you know, they can smell a tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: and have a good idea which strain that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this show is very much whole
plant-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we hold up ethanol as essentially
being the gold standard for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For REC, you know, there's a lot of other
things that people may prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a patient that we want to get them
the widest range of cannabinoids with the
[SPEAKER_00]: widest spectrum of terpenes, you know,
ethanol seems to be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I'm curious to know from your
experience, what are we still losing from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant when we do an ethanol
extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there's something that we're
losing that we may want.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might not make it through the ethanol
extraction process that's valuable to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: to patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mono terpenes are gonna evaporate
off very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you redistill or flash off the
ethanol from a hash oil extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna lose those mono terpenes,
which are pretty important to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the method I was talking about earlier
where you do the cold finger extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: let the unit cool down so there's not
gonna be a bunch of vapor coming off when
[SPEAKER_02]: you open it up, and then pour that off,
carbon filter it, and drop the wax out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That terpene profile will be intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're distilling off the ethanol,
you're gonna, you know, you'll probably
[SPEAKER_02]: still have some sesquiterpenes,
which are gonna lose mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, you know, if you don't mind me
making a little pitch for our products,
[SPEAKER_02]: our modern day commercial extractor
distillers that we do for cold ethanol and
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of other things, they can be
configured to do steam distilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could steam distill your cannabis
first, get your essential oils or mono
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, then, you know, spin the water
out with a centrifuge, and put it back in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and ethanol extract it, then refine
out the chlorophyll in the wax and add
[SPEAKER_02]: those terpenes back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got a very, you know,
full spectrum extract that has only the
[SPEAKER_02]: things you want in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a question about treating the
ethanol hash oil after the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will say that ethanol
extraction can provide everything that the
[SPEAKER_00]: modern cannabis market is looking for,
from the EHO, to dabs, to viscous liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: for pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not a professional
extractor, so I don't know what after
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction processes would need to be done
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems that that might be a little
overstated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can ethanol do it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we really need the whole range of
CO2 and BHO for these different products
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are enjoying in the modern
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally speaking, you know, because the
main market now is vape pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think the best vape pens are
where you, you know, run a CO2 unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes, you know, some talent to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do make good CO2 oil takes,
you know, talent and artistic ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cruddy CO2 oil out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do the terpene pull,
which is, you know, they jump out really
[SPEAKER_02]: early and you make that terp sauce and
then set that aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, drain it out or squirt it out
and then finish the extraction and refine,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all the cannabinoids down and
add that early terp pull back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the best way to make a tasty
full spectrum, you know, vape pen product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the, the only good, the only good
vape pen products that I've had that were
[SPEAKER_02]: ethanol is where they, they short path the
ethanol extract and get it to like pure
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they had the terpenes
added back in, whether they steam
[SPEAKER_02]: distilled it or they bought terpenes from,
you know, Ben at True Terpenes or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the only time I've seen a good
ethanol vape pen is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a distilled, you know, clear that's like
95% cannabinoids with terpenes added back
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the vape pens I've seen that were
kind of less refined ethanol extracts were
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty nasty tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've seen really good ethanol
shatter, which is, you know, basically you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be able to see the ethanol coming
through the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and when you see, when it starts
to change color and get darker,
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only, you know, you want to get the
very first, you know, kind of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: first press of olive oil, you know,
is the best oil, the virgin oil and kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like the terp sauce with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, with cold ethanol,
you needed to see it passing through and
[SPEAKER_02]: what color it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, while it's still a bright,
pretty golden, that's the stuff that can
[SPEAKER_02]: be turned into shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll have a real nice taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that you mentioned olive
oil, because when you, when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking earlier about how using CO2
extraction for the vape pen market to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it properly, it takes more than just an
understanding of how the CO2 extractor
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually takes a depth of knowledge and
artistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who came to mind was our mutual
friend, Jeff Church, presently over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Puffin Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and he, you know, they, they,
they, they push this term EVFO,
[SPEAKER_00]: extra virgin flower oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, the product that they
make is, is top of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste like these, you know,
like these, you know, hot dog water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, soupy pens of distillate and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a, it's got a depth of flavor
that you don't get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like when you see, you know,
any kind of artisan put out a product and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, you're like, damn,
this is, this is very much better than all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other stuff I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that idea of a, of a first
pressing of an olive oil, uh, versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a, an extra virgin cannabis oil
is, is apt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, props to Jeff and Sam back in the
day for, they were the first people to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how to, how to get a pure terp
or a pure terpene run with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, one of the earliest terp
festivals, um, you know, Jeff entered that
[SPEAKER_02]: product and it was a pure terpene CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were people that wanted to
disqualify him because they said it can't
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're, you're lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we pushed really hard and got
that turned around and they got the award.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, yeah, they were the first to
do it or the first I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they were able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, now it's, I wouldn't call it
common now, but there's certainly a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more people doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, Jeff and Sam to my
knowledge were the first to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember that year of the
terpestival and, and, and, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of drama around it on awards night
and Jeff's poor broken heart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, you know, Jeff worked his ass
off to develop this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them to say that you're
disqualified because what you did isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's pretty, that's pretty
groundbreaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from our point of view in the very
early CO2 days, you know, there were
[SPEAKER_02]: always those who wanted to knock CO2,
especially, you know, the BHO that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's kind of a competition
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, people would say, ah,
CO2 sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get any terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then five or six years later,
the insult is CO2 is only good for
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so, so yeah, clearly CO2 and the
extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, the extraction artists,
if you will themselves, they've evolved a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the, in the early days, you guys had to
do a lot of training of extraction teams
[SPEAKER_00]: just so that they could use your,
your, your, you know, extraction machines
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't give you guys a bad name
because of the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but nowadays that, um, you know,
that insight is, is a lot more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so in that same idea as, uh,
you know, the, the, the evolution of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each big evolution in technology
opens up like new markets and creates new
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as a coming evolution in
extraction tech that will create new
[SPEAKER_00]: market opportunities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you don't, it doesn't have to be
ethanol either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Eden labs produces an entire range
of extraction equipment from CO2 to BHO to
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as the R and D guy,
they're trying to push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see coming down the pipe that,
that might open up new doors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for new products?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually figured this out quite a
few years ago, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for various reasons, we didn't,
we didn't push it too much at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're going to start promoting the
concept of adding a small amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: propane to CO2 because it's, it's kind of,
well, what was explained to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the guys who do the large scale short
pathing, mostly right now they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: ethanol extracts and, and, you know,
the ethanol, the advantage to the ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: is you can just do such large scale,
you know, quickly and affordably,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of the refiners, you know,
they, they don't like the ethanol because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many, they have to do many
passes and there's, there's always
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with, uh, different kinds of
particulate that are in there and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, ethanol that, you know, they might
have to do one or two passes just to get
[SPEAKER_02]: residual ethanol out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'm told, I'm not a short path
guy myself, but I certainly have good
[SPEAKER_02]: friends that are, and they like,
they like hydrocarbon extracts and they
[SPEAKER_02]: like CO2 extracts as far as what they like
to refine with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the CO2 they believe is too
slow of a process and the hydrocarbon has,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the flammability risks and the
liability risks and the regulatory risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that we can add a small amount
of propane to CO2 and it will,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the extraction will be as fast as with
just pure hydrocarbon, but it won't be
[SPEAKER_02]: flammable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough propane because the CO2
represses that and, you know, even if the
[SPEAKER_02]: system were to leak badly, both gases stay
mixed and settle on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we know for a fact that,
you know, with that can, we can do this in
[SPEAKER_02]: a way that it's not flammable and it's,
it extracts is very, very quickly and
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's, it's been requested that,
you know, we start pushing this and bring
[SPEAKER_02]: this to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's the next thing we're going
to push.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I already know that, you know,
there's other, there's starting to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: buzz out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've got a couple of
competitors that are also pushing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, we know John McKay's
mentioned it a few times in public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we, we don't know for sure because,
um, you know, these trends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: take a momentum of their own, but it makes
sense that this could become, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new method, especially for people who
want to do refining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you that the idea of mixing propane
with CO2 just kind of blew a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, no way I need to know
more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's what keeps this exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that, um, you know,
the people who are really into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: who have got a blend of engineering
science and, you know, passionate vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: they continually push this and,
and that's why we find all these great new
[SPEAKER_00]: technological solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and with that, so thank you for
spending some time with us, Fritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that you're not usually
the guy who's out talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually AC Braddock from,
from, um, from Eden labs, but the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were willing to, you know,
come out of your, your, your laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and spend some time with us to,
you know, give us a taste of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: history from the early days, uh,
up to what you, what you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: happening right now, uh, is very kind of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
