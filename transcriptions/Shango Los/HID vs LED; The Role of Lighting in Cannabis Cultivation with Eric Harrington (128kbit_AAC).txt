[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to do a slide on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got it done yet, but it's
actually a little cartoon of a tombstone
[SPEAKER_02]: with HID RIP on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, as of this year,
pretty much all of your top flight LED
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are all at 2.2, 2.3,
2.4, even 2.5 micromoles a joule.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 25% to 40% more efficient
electrically than HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really kind of the death knell of
HID for at least people that can't afford
[SPEAKER_02]: either one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously, there are situations
where you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have the money for either one,
the LEDs really do outperform them in
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much every category, whether it be
yield or efficiency, whatever you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're superior at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to kind of blow through here
real quickly some of the early parts,
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding HID lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people will hear about ceramic
metal halide lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll try and portray them as something
different than a metal halide lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a ceramic metal halide lamp,
the only change is they change this inner
[SPEAKER_02]: tube in here to ceramic, the same kind of
glass that they have in the HID lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that allowed them to do was put a lot
more of the red halides, made the red
[SPEAKER_02]: halides more stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the lamp would preserve that red color
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember, the old metal halides
would always go green whenever the lamp
[SPEAKER_02]: would get old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because that red halide is very
reactive, number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, it actually can permeate
through the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ceramic tube made the ceramic metal
halide much more stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Color stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally developed for the film
industry, but it got translated into the
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this shows you HID.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of your HID systems, you'll notice,
have a dimmable knob on your ballast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is HID, high pressure sodium,
is why it's called high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is the pressure of that lamp
actually affects the spectrum of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you look at this, this is the lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the original papers written
by the guys who invented the HPS lamp back
[SPEAKER_02]: in 1953 or something, 57.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice this is at like 200
watts, 400 watts, 600 watts on a 600 watt
[SPEAKER_02]: lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice that almost all the power is
right at the sodium band, which is this
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow band.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you increase the pressure, you'll
notice that more of the energy keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: getting squashed into the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, right around the sodium
band, it starts to drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem with dimming an HPS lamp is
that as you dim it, it goes this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dim your HPS lamp 20 or 30%,
you may be getting 40 or 50% less
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetically active energy because
this area here is really the only
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient photosynthetic energy in the
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green yellow is about 40% less
efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get into that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why it's not a good idea to dim
either metal halides or high pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas LEDs can dim absolutely perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no change to their efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they get more efficient when you
dim them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the spectrum doesn't change at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, as I mentioned, this is really
the area where you're going to tie into
[SPEAKER_02]: the chlorophyll peaks, this area here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This area here is really somewhere in the
range of about 40% less efficient in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of actual photosynthetic output,
the green yellow region.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's the double-ended lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference what happened to
double-ended lamps is basically they made
[SPEAKER_02]: the lamp a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: The arc path got shorter so that the
stability of the arc path was better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gained maybe 10%, 15% in the lamp
design.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason, the biggest reason why
double-ended lamps are so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient now is actually fixture savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old fixtures were incredibly
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had glass lenses, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them were air-cooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflectors were not well-designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Gavita literally, with this
double-ended lamp, as the lamp gets
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller, the smaller that arc path gets,
the easier it is to get all the photons
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the fixture in one bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your goal in designing a reflective
fixture is to try and have every single
[SPEAKER_02]: photon that's going backwards is not going
out the front come out of that fixture in
[SPEAKER_02]: one bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by getting the lamp very small,
the arc path very small, with a really
[SPEAKER_02]: highly well-designed fixture with no lens
on it, you're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Gavita's literally gotten those fixture
efficiencies up to around 95% where they
[SPEAKER_02]: used to be maybe 80 or 75%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you're, believe it or not,
that's the big advantage in these new
[SPEAKER_02]: double-ended lamps was the advantage,
the fixture efficiencies were so
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically higher than any of the stuff
that you were seeing with the single-ended
[SPEAKER_02]: lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are the lamps a little more
efficient, but the fixtures are
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically more efficient than they used
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, the whole idea of LEDs is to try
and, I mean, fixture efficiency is trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that light out in one bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a really rudimentary reflector.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where you might have to bounce
two or three times to get out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing you want to remember when
you're talking about HID lamps is if they
[SPEAKER_02]: rate 20,000 hours or 10,000 hours on the
lamp, that's a half-life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was designed back in the days when
they were lighting warehouses with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that basically told you in 20,000 hours
half of the lamps will still be burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is absolutely not usable and not
appropriate or worthwhile information in
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why most people are replacing their
HID lamps in anywhere from six months to a
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with LED designs, basically you have a
ceramic substrate on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This effectively is an insulator from the
chip that insulates it from the board
[SPEAKER_02]: below the actual circuit board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also is the primary heat sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the primary heat sink of that
chip, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the lens on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in your white LEDs, this lens will
actually contain phosphors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be a blue LED that would be
irradiating those phosphors and the
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphors would create white light.
[SPEAKER_02]: In discrete LEDs, that's just a clear lens
that gives you your throw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can change.
[SPEAKER_02]: A normal LED is 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes in all directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: More, it's almost a perfect mountain type
curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: More in the middle and as it spreads out
to the sides, it drops off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's 180 degree type spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: What this lens allows you to do is take
that down to 120 degrees or 80 degrees or
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 degrees or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a funny article I read in Phys
.org.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some university's engineering department
literally published that they got more
[SPEAKER_02]: energy out of an LED than they put in by
running like microwatts through a three
[SPEAKER_02]: watt LED and there was this holst.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they published this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just see the physics department
pulling their hair out screaming,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, you didn't actually publish that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it does tell you and they've
documented this numerous times is LEDs
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiencies, when you run them really,
really cool, if you keep that junction
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature really, really low,
the efficiencies are remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get upwards of 90% or better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where right now they're running around
30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the future of LEDs is really bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's almost unlimited how much,
you know, up to 100% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to continue to get better
and better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's mostly about this substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly about improving this heat
conductivity of this substrate material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the majority of your LEDs out there
are plastic substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is starting to make a move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Osrum was the first one to go to a ceramic
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't conduct heat dramatically
better than the plastic, but the material
[SPEAKER_02]: itself has a similar density and hardness
and porosity to the chip, the silicon chip
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're able to make a much more
dynamic, much stronger bond between the
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thermal conductivity is more
consistent over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at, as the fixtures,
if you look at the Osrum, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: published by Osrum, the majority of your
LEDs out there that have a plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate are talking about 30%
degradation over 50 to 60,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now granted flowering, that's 18 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Osrum with the ceramic substrate is
literally talking about 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10% degradation over 100,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, the lifespan of these LEDs is
they're going to last a lot longer than
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to want them, than you're
going to be using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to replace them probably long
before they wear out purely from
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency gains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the beauty of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're extremely robust, extremely
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use them for 10 years and they
won't change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to touch them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a long standing argument
about passive versus active cooling in
[SPEAKER_02]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of the common sense feel about it
is, well, you know, why would you want
[SPEAKER_02]: fans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fans are the number one failure point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is that that whole mindset comes
from these Chinese ballasts that always
[SPEAKER_02]: have a fan that's the first thing that
fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys have had these
LumiTech and these other ballasts and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: always the fan that goes out because they
use cheap fans because they want you to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy another one in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is that if you buy a high
quality server grid fan, they last 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: 60,000 hours absolutely reliably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fans really are not a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're extremely inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overwhelming, I should say the
dominant opinion in the industry is if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use fans, go ahead and use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll keep the chips cooler under a wider
variety of environmental conditions than
[SPEAKER_02]: you will under passive cooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The advantage of passive cooled,
the only real major advantage is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to make it waterproof, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water and rain and everything is going to
be splashing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a fan in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make them waterproof, but still,
that's an environment that's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be super conducive to fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really the major advantage of
passive cooled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, there really isn't one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fan cooling is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's superior.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can start getting your big lights
like the Fluent Spiders, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously passive cool is the only way you
can do it when you do big strips like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends on the design and the
application, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in spectrum, we all understand kind
of the basics of spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice there's a little bit of a
peak in the blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of that is due to the fact that not
only do you have sunlight coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: with a fairly balanced spectrum,
then the skylight is a very blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you kind of a peak in the blue
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how the eyes see light.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is important when you start talking
about lumens or lux and how you rate light
[SPEAKER_02]: or how you measure light.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how the eye sees light,
with a big spike in the green region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, lux and lumens are based on the way
they're adjusted to reflect how your eye
[SPEAKER_02]: would see that light, the visual
brightness of that light, not the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: photons coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how plants see light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your chlorophyll A and B peaks
in both the red and the blue region.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green region, where the eye sees the
light best, is very, very low
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is utilized better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see the McCree curves, it's
utilized better than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is still the green-yellow
region is about 40% less efficient than
[SPEAKER_02]: the red and blue regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The peaks, anyway, of the red and blue
regions in terms of actual photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't use lumens or lux-type rating
on any lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really try and compare them
because they're based on how your eye sees
[SPEAKER_02]: it, not how the plant utilizes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the beta-carotene also shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the actual how plants use light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, light strikes the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water gets the hydrogen stripped out
of it, releases the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hydrogen and the carbon and the
carbon dioxide are bound together and it
[SPEAKER_02]: creates a sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, every 10 photons, roughly 10
photons, creates a carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bottom line is the whole goal in
cannabis is to try and get as many photons
[SPEAKER_02]: as that plant can possibly absorb and
utilize efficiently in that period of time
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have because every 10 photons is
a carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, like I was talking about lumens,
lumens are designed for eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way the industry rates lighting for
light for horticulture is with PAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: PAR is Photosynthetically Active
Radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That basically means that it's weighting
all of the spectrums that are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic region from deep blue all
the way to not far red, but the very far
[SPEAKER_02]: end of red.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those spectrum are all weighted
evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why even PAR readings are not
actually a really accurate way to compare
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as I showed you before,
that yellow-green region is 40% less
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient, but PAR rates it the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why if you see a light,
an HPS light, which is 50% green,
[SPEAKER_02]: half the spectrum of an HPS light is in
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see a HPS light saying 1,600
micromoles and you see an LED light that
[SPEAKER_02]: has 10% green, that has 1,600 micromoles,
that LED light has substantially more
[SPEAKER_02]: actual photosynthetic activity in a plant
because all that green light has been
[SPEAKER_02]: taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's using only spectrums that the plant
can utilize most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's until recently, until this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this year that all of the LEDs
are now electrically more efficient than
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, the entire market was roughly
electrically, meaning the micromoles per
[SPEAKER_02]: joule rating, the power into photons out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were about equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority of the LEDs were all
about 1.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the savings they were getting,
which was around 25% to 30% for the better
[SPEAKER_02]: companies like California Lightworks,
we were getting routinely, in tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% to 30% savings consistently,
purely on this photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally just because of shaving out all
that green out of the light, we were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get 25% to 30% more efficiency versus
HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with the 25% electrical efficiency
advantage, the efficiency gain is really
[SPEAKER_02]: around 45% to 50% almost now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why when I say HID RIP,
I mean this year at 50% more efficient or
[SPEAKER_02]: 45% more efficient, it's pretty much this
is going to spell the end of HPS as a
[SPEAKER_02]: practical solution for horticulture as of
this year going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you add those two together,
it's a dramatically more efficient system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they really need, and this system
isn't in place yet, is an adjusted PAR,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a way of taking the PAR value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of your PAR meters, if you invest
in the really expensive ones that have
[SPEAKER_02]: software in them, you can actually take
the PAR measurement and run it through the
[SPEAKER_02]: McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually run it through this
absorption curve down here, the
[SPEAKER_02]: utilization curve rather, and it will give
you the actual PAR, the adjusted PAR of
[SPEAKER_02]: what the actual photosynthetic activity in
the plant is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really the only way,
absolutely accurate way to compare two
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people walking around the
show with PAR meters comparing lights with
[SPEAKER_02]: PAR meters, and it gives you a rough idea,
but it's really not accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really the only way to know for
sure really how the lights compare is by
[SPEAKER_02]: running them through this absorption curve
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some of your other lighting
sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is a really good comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows you exactly where HPS lines up on
the absorption curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the overall peak absorption curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look where it lines up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire of HPS is all in a relatively
low efficiency area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in none of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally has nothing up in the high
peaks except for this little spike here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different HPS up, different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this can change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The newer lamps are starting to run higher
and higher pressure, so they're starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to squash a little more of this on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see some of them won't be a little
flatter if they're running a little higher
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the majority of the energy still,
especially this whole half over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's why I say 50% of the green
yellow, this whole half over here is all
[SPEAKER_02]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we were getting all our
savings last year and the year before
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with the electrical, it's just way
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting 40% to 45%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't dim HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's two kinds of LEDs out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One camp I call the a billion years of
evolution can't be wrong camp,
[SPEAKER_02]: which says, well, sunlight's white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants have been evolving for millions and
millions of years under white light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes perfect logical sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is the science doesn't agree
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The science suggests we know exactly where
the plants absorb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these peaks, and the plant absorbs
most of the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much more efficiently at these exact
chlorophyll A and B peaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are other pigments that can
absorb light and can translate that light
[SPEAKER_02]: into energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them have to go through the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They require chlorophyll aid to be around
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the carotenoid system, the red and
yellows in your plants, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: carotenoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's underneath the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: The carotenoid layer is actually beneath
the chlorophyll layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the carotenoid layer is less
efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual conversion to energy isn't that
much less efficient than chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's beneath, and the chlorophyll's
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very color the carotenoids absorb
is reflected away by those chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of the green-blue region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the white LED camp, or the full
spectrum camp, says that white light is
[SPEAKER_02]: best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your white LEDs that are
basically a blue LED with white phosphors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They create, let me see if the next,
here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a white LED kind of spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of exaggerated, but usually
they have a big blue spike because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: blue LED driving that white gob or that
white LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue LED, and then you have all,
this is the phosphors creating this big
[SPEAKER_02]: mound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then most of the really, the top shelf
LEDs will have a red spike over here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Fluence, you'll notice they'll have a
red spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's with discrete red LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll have their white LEDs that does
this kind of a curve, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have a red LED giving them a little spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one camp, or middle halite would
be more of a flat spectrum, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty high in the blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in all of those white LEDs,
you still have this major 30 to 40% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy is all being produced in this
region that's underutilized by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the LEDs that I call the distribution
of discrete LED designs, like California
[SPEAKER_02]: Light Works, like Lou McRoe, they use a
combination of red and blue LEDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically at the chlorophyll peaks,
and then a white LED in a lower power
[SPEAKER_02]: density, like 20% or 30% of the total
power, to cover the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a pretty easy argument
to be made that if you're trying to look
[SPEAKER_02]: for the absolutely most efficient way to
drive a plant, this approach is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually see it in side-by-side
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not dramatically more efficient
than the white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing somewhere in the world from 5
to 10% better efficiency in terms of true
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can run slightly less power than a
white LED and get the same growth rates
[SPEAKER_02]: because of this, because we're not wasting
a lot of energy on the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is one caveat on that,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green bounces around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bounces off the chlorophyll,
and it does absorb, and it can absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: through the bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a canopy that's really
unruly, that's not pruned properly,
[SPEAKER_02]: that has a lot of shading happening in it,
lights with more green will actually
[SPEAKER_02]: perform better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That green will perform better in those
heavily shaded canopies than it will in a
[SPEAKER_02]: well-pruned canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why when they talk about HPS
having better penetration, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what I think they're meaning and they're
seeing, is that if they've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: shading in their canopy, the HPS will give
them some good penetration in areas that
[SPEAKER_02]: are shaded because that green light's
going right through the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's bouncing off of them and bouncing
around in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to any master grower worth his
salt, and he'll tell you pruning that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is half your yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the gain is shaping that plant so
that nothing but flowers see light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much labor it takes to get you to
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really probably the single biggest
thing you can do to increase your yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: is to maximize exclusively flowers seeing
light and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while the green helps in those shaded
canopies, it's a really bad way to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: having a lot of shaded flowers in your
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how they compare to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to talk about spectrum a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very fanciful term called
photomorphogenesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It refers to the fact that plants,
all class three plants, in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: all class three and class four plants,
when they absorb different frequencies,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can actually make them show different
pheno expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've used it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 20, 30 years now people have been
growing cannabis, they've been using metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide in veg, they've been using HPS in
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is because metal halide is a
blue dominant light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And blue light tends to favor vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to favor, promote leaf production
and root production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red light tends to promote flower
production, fruiting, and stem production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's obviously it's a function
of billions of years or millions of years
[SPEAKER_02]: of spring to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light and the sunlight is more blue in
the early stages in the high growth
[SPEAKER_02]: period, during the middle of the growth
period, as it starts getting into the late
[SPEAKER_02]: fall, it gets more and more red dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that triggers the flowering
responses on a lot of plants that flower
[SPEAKER_02]: based on red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because of this, we can actually use
the spectrum to tell the plant what we
[SPEAKER_02]: want it to do with the photons it's
absorbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to having one fixed spectrum
and just letting the plant do whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: wants, if you put more red light on that
flower, it will produce more flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And less leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put more blue on that plant while
it's flowering, it will produce more
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves in those flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've ever compared an outdoor
plant, like an outdoor cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: to an indoor one under HPS, you'll see
that the HPS literally just has little
[SPEAKER_02]: fingertip leaves coming out of the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at outdoor plants, the leaves are
big leaves coming out of your flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And metal halide has longer leaves coming
out of the flowers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is because there's more blue
during the flower peak flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of that energy that that plant is
absorbing is going into leaf production
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of flower production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now any of you that have done a scrub grow
and have trimmed all the leaves off and
[SPEAKER_02]: had nothing but flowers, no, you don't
need some leaves to grow flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower, the little leaves,
even those little finger leaves of HPS are
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to flower successfully and really
get dense flowers with cannabis once the
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sun leaves are helpful during the
first two weeks when the plant's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: really fast and really big.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't really, they're really not
necessary later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reality is you want to try and
drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why have we been using this ratio
forever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Using metal halide, oops, using metal
halide in veg, using HPS in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: By using discrete LEDs with variable
spectrum, you can actually change the
[SPEAKER_02]: ratios of the red and blue throughout the
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that allows you to do is say,
for example, a typical ratio of red to
[SPEAKER_02]: blue for veg is about 60-40, 60% red,
40% blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost always, virtually any grow light
you look at is going to have more red than
[SPEAKER_02]: blue because red is photosynthetically
more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue takes more energy while still
making the same carbohydrate so it's more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to do blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any light you want to run more red than
blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in veg, to get lots of leaf and get
you that true veg metal halide style of
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative growth, you might run something
like 60-40 red to blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we can do with what we do with
California Lightworks or with Lumigrow,
[SPEAKER_02]: with any of the discrete type LED systems,
in preflower, which is those first two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, you can crank the power up and run
70-30.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still running a lot of blue at
70-30 because HPS is like 95-5,
[SPEAKER_02]: 95% red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hardly any blue at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you run 70-30 the first two weeks,
keeping your plant kind of compact.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind, you've got lots of
room, you run more red and less blue,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll get a bigger stretchier plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll be bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you want to remember is that
there's no magic formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no magic spectrum that's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody tells you they've got the magic
formula.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's dozens of different ratios that
will do different things, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: what you want to do with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of leveraging spectrum,
is that there's a different spectrum to
[SPEAKER_02]: get peak yield, to get maximum yield for
top-shell flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a different spectrum for maximum
yield, pure yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a different spectrum for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can literally, there's a different
spectrum to keep the little plants really
[SPEAKER_02]: compact if you're room, if you're space
challenged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can leverage this spectrum
throughout the flower cycle to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: use that function, that
photomorphogenesis, to get the plant to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what you want it to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a level of control you just
will never get with a fixed spectrum line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the yield advantages aren't dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we see between the white and
discrete spectrum in tests we've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhere in five to 10% range,
you know, advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of quality and flower
structure, you can actually have some
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial differences if you're willing,
but it's all a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get tons and tons of
resonance, super, super resonance,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have to sacrifice a little
flower mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your flowers will be a little smaller,
but a lot harder and denser.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sacrifice by running you run more
blue, you get more resin terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: production at the end, but you get a
little less flower production,
[SPEAKER_02]: actual flower material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You run more red, you get bigger flowers,
but a little less resin because you've
[SPEAKER_02]: only got so much energy to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no magic ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but with the discrete LED system,
you have that flexibility to choose where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want that to go, where you want that
energy to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as this industry matures, it's going
to get more and more and more competitive,
[SPEAKER_02]: and quality is going to become,
unless you're extracting, quality is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to become more and more and more
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this, with the discrete lighting
system, you have the flexibility to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to change that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sacrifice a little bit of yield to
get denser and denser and higher quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to, those other guys can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got what they got.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll try and do it with nutrients,
and trust me, they aren't going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: very far with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only so much you can do with
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, again, white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally don't even look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into some other spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: UVB, this is an actual insert from the
study done in 1987 by the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Maryland at the University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ultimate irony that all federal
testing is done at University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi, go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But University of Maryland did a test with
UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: From zero to equatorial sun level UVB
exposure, all the way through veg and
[SPEAKER_02]: flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually did it all the way through
the entire veg and flour process.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end, they came to a baseline of 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they were Mexican sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems pretty likely they were true sativas
because that's a pretty high THC level for
[SPEAKER_02]: 1987.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their zero UVB was 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% UVB was 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% UVB of equatorial sun, which is
roughly 500 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 500 microwatts per square centimeter
was 32%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a 7% increase over zero to
100% or 33% more THC at equatorial sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's linear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a linear function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So California Light Works has a UVB lamp,
for example, that we've designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we designed it specifically at two
lamps over a four by four tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will give you, effectively,
California or 30th parallel UVB levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is roughly 350 microwatts per square
centimeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We chose that just because we know all the
cannabis plants probably have evolved at
[SPEAKER_02]: least at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want to go to, you can try
equatorial sun if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not sure that the indica plants
are going to be able to tolerate that
[SPEAKER_02]: because they evolved at the 30th parallel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 350 microwatts per square centimeter is
a nice, safe amount of UVB for pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: any plant, unless you're talking
Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you're talking autoflowers,
those are from Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're even a higher latitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they might tolerate less.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of research to be done on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can pretty much assume from
UVB is if you provide equatorial sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be able to get somewhere in the
neighborhood of 30 plus percent increase
[SPEAKER_02]: in your THC levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: At California sun level UVB, you should be
able to get 20% to 25% more UVB,
[SPEAKER_02]: or more THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got 20% plant, that goes to
24%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I typically tell people, if you're in a
market where your THC is aggressively
[SPEAKER_02]: measured, if you're in a market where your
pounds, literally your price per pound is
[SPEAKER_02]: based on THC levels, any of those markets
where THC is going to change your
[SPEAKER_02]: profitability, you're going to change your
competitiveness, UVB really makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a layer of complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use your UVB in the room,
you need to turn them off when you go in
[SPEAKER_02]: that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not want to work under UVB,
because it's not the same as sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunlight shuts your eye down
automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your pupil shuts right down.
[SPEAKER_02]: These lights are really dim when you look
at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at these lights without eye
protection, you're getting eight to 10
[SPEAKER_02]: times as much UVB exposure from the
lights, potentially, if you're within a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple feet of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to walk in my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had UVB lamps in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd walk in there and forget about
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be six inches from my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be walking around like, oh,
crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd run back outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd been standing at two feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're getting 300 micromoles at two
feet, you're getting 1,200 micromoles at
[SPEAKER_02]: six inches, or 1,200 microwatts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to be careful using
UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: I strongly recommend it if it makes sense
in your market, if it's going to make you
[SPEAKER_02]: more competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you really got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on its own circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Control it separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the California Lightworks UVB lamp now
comes with a little flashing LED that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to drive you crazy if it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in there, it'll drive you
nuts, because it'll be flashing all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll know that it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's get into application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one other thing I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, when you're comparing LEDs to
HBS, you're just comparing pure energy
[SPEAKER_02]: savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can actually increase your
capability for those of you that have
[SPEAKER_02]: power challenges, your panel just won't
handle, you've got plenty of space,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just your panel's undersized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to mess with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pay for your light LEDs in a crop
or two, a turn or two, because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: increase your canopy by 40% if you go to
LEDs, if you're a power challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just counting on the energy
savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're talking 40% more yield each
round, because you can run 40% more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can run 40% more canopy on the same
amount of power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really fast payback,
if that's your case, if you're power
[SPEAKER_02]: challenged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much faster than just energy savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to start getting into a
really commonly misunderstood aspect about
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key to lighting plants indoors,
whether it be green, and this is true of
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses or indoors, is you want to try
and get as close to true diffusion as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diffusion means light coming from all
directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Routinely throughout the last 20 years,
the common mindset was you put that light
[SPEAKER_02]: down close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the light down close because it gets
more penetration, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Inverse square law says the closer you
are, the brighter the light is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem is the inverse square law doesn't
mean the light is brighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only means that as you get closer,
it's illuminating a smaller area.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you raise the lights, all you're doing
is expanding the area it's illuminating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every photon still reaches the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no losses by raising the lights
up, unless it bounces off the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the advantage is when you raise the
lights up, is now all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start getting cross over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights start crossing over and hitting
different parts of the plant that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would not see.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at a plant and you put the
light down close, here's a perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a Christmas tree shaped plant,
style plant, four foot tall with a four
[SPEAKER_02]: foot diameter base, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: The circle that that base creates on the
floor is 10 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cone of that Christmas tree shaped
plant, the outer cone it forms,
[SPEAKER_02]: is 70 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how much more leaf area there is
than the footprint on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the closer the light is to that
plant, the more, all the light can see is
[SPEAKER_02]: the footprint on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get that light right down and
there's one light straight over the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, all it's shining on is an area
of leaf the size of footprint on the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is shaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you raise the light up or make it
bigger, because that effectively is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing, making the light bigger or
raising it up and getting it to overlap
[SPEAKER_02]: does roughly the same thing, because it's
getting the light coming from multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you raise it up and get diffusion,
now all of a sudden, you're lighting more
[SPEAKER_02]: higher and higher percentage of that
canopy evenly, because the lights are
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing over.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is here, now all of a sudden,
this fixture is shining on, that fixture
[SPEAKER_02]: is shining on, that one's shining.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different fixtures, so the
light's penetrating in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it takes it from a planar
lighting to a volumetric lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, all of our lighting measurements
are always in square centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always in this planar measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But canopies aren't planar, they're
volumetric.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you raise those lights up and get more
diffusion, you'll illuminate more square
[SPEAKER_02]: feet of actual leaf area in that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you do that, believe it or not,
your power density can slowly drift up,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're using more of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not over driving those areas of the
plant that are exposed while the shaded
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's part's not being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants were designed with the sun to have
the sun move, so it moves around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very intense in one place,
but it constantly moves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor grows, you don't have that
advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have shading happening in your
plant, you're wasting that leaf absorption
[SPEAKER_02]: in those areas while over driving other
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way to stop that is either to do
like a scrub, where literally every square
[SPEAKER_02]: inch, there's no shading anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gone through all of the mechanical
effort, the work to get the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly manicured so that it all sees
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you raise those lights up, and most of
your commercial grows, you know the time
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the big commercial grows I see,
they're not doing scrub grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's way too time consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're down to three or four foot tall
or five foot tall plant, as you raise
[SPEAKER_02]: those lights up, now you're illuminating
more and more and more of the leaf area of
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're turning it into a volumetric
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your power density on any one leaf is
going to slowly drop, because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading it out over more area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So believe it or not, that allows you to
raise your power density, your amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: power up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running 800 micromoles right now
on your grow, if you raise those lights up
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a really, really diffused light on
that plant, you might be able to pump that
[SPEAKER_02]: up to 1,000 and use it, utilize it
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will get higher density in the
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get higher density throughout the
plant, more even distribution and density
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the plant by doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's strange, but it's just
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody thinks down close is
better, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now think about this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a two foot tall plant,
and you put your lights two foot above the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of the plant, and the bottom branch is
two feet below the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's two foot to the top, and it's four
foot to the bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inverse square law says, X to the top of
the plant, one quarter X to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Inverse square of the distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you raise that light to six feet
above the top, to the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's six feet to the top of the plant,
it's eight feet to the bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you square that to the top,
it's 36, you square it to the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: branch, it's 64, it's half as much light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So purely just through the inverse square
law, if you look at it from the inverse
[SPEAKER_02]: square law, as you raise the light up,
yes, the intensity from that one light
[SPEAKER_02]: goes down because you're spreading the
light over a bigger area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got all the other lights
overlapping, so the power density stays
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you put power up there is what
you get down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you raise the lights up,
any one light, the differential between
[SPEAKER_02]: the top and the bottom gets less and less
and less as you raise the lights up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start getting a narrow, narrower band,
a band that's closer in terms of total
[SPEAKER_02]: light level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's go ahead and have some
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a nursery in Southern Oregon and
I'm really focused on rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if you had looked at any
studies or have any information on optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely going to be using LEDs for
rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from what I've been able to see,
I've looked and I've not seen any really
[SPEAKER_02]: specific data on spectrum affecting
cloning, rooting and cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have seen some that suggest that
blue light tends to enhance root
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red light, the ratio of red to far red,
interestingly, has a similar effect that
[SPEAKER_02]: it does in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, there's one thing I wanted
to mention you guys too before we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far red is what causes plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not lighting level, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants will stretch because they don't see
enough light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stretch because shade light has more
far red and the ratio of far red to red is
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to cause that plant to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other reason why they
stretch in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the same mechanism, the ratio of
far red to red is the same mechanism that
[SPEAKER_02]: triggers the flower response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting a shade stretch response
and a flower response at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to clarify the question
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about actual light levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I mean, I know people
that do cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lighting requirements for clones are
very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's really the key to cloning
is all about temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: preserving a really consistent humidity
level at the canopy and keeping your
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature at that canopy consistent and
the root temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really all about that and oxygen
levels, obviously getting that oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using clone plugs, trying to get
them to dry out to the optimum aeration
[SPEAKER_02]: first, you know, because they always start
out a little too damp and trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to that perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm not really an expert in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's not my field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, so I wish I could help you more
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any other questions about lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I had a question earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was talking about the phosphorus
in the white LED and the degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you maybe speak on the possibility
of spectral changes in the life of the LED
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to the phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the phosphorus do degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, it's not terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they degrade trying to be 60,
80,000 hour type ranges about where they
[SPEAKER_02]: really start to degrade, where you get a
noticeable amount of degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, is it enough when everything is
going up so rapidly?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of the decisions of talking
about 20 years life and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when the light's going to be 30
percent more efficient in another two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three years, are we really going to be
still using them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: In five years, when they're 45 percent
more efficient again, the next generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think where the commercial lighting
is going to go is you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: see these things being cycled through
every so often, just like a computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people may run them
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're going to be as competitive
as this industry is, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to be more and more and more
competitive, you're going to have to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the power utilization in lighting is
one of your number one biggest costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you're going to have to stay
on that curve and stay ahead of that curve
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of efficiency if you want to be
competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, greenhouse is a little less
important because it's only half your
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting that you're doing with,
and by the way, on greenhouse lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at greenhouse lighting,
the other beauty of LEDs in supplementing
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses is that they're, because
they're dimmable, now you're not just
[SPEAKER_02]: turning them on in the morning and turning
them off and then turning them on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon and turning them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: With LEDs, you can dim them continuously.
[SPEAKER_02]: California Lightworks has a photo sensor
control that actually dims those lights up
[SPEAKER_02]: and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some goes down to cloud, boom,
they come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some goes down behind the cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come back down again automatically
all through the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you literally can get a greenhouse to
have indoor quality lighting by using LEDs
[SPEAKER_02]: as a supplementary light in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've run out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Eric Harrington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
