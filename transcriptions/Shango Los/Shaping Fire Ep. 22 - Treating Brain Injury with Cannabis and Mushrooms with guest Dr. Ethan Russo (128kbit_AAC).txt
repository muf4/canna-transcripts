[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, there wasn't much
concern about concussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fell or hit your head, we'd look
for blood, but if you didn't break the
[SPEAKER_01]: skin, we were told to shake it off and
keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even as an adult back in those days,
if you were hit by a falling brick or a
[SPEAKER_01]: car or playing sports, you were pretty
much told to go put ice on it and get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to work as soon as you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last decade though, the diagnosis
of traumatic brain injury or TBI has
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a lot more serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: TBI was diagnosed in nearly 3 million
Americans in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, about 20,000 armed service
members receive traumatic brain injury
[SPEAKER_01]: every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 5.3 million Americans live their
lives trying to manage the symptoms that
[SPEAKER_01]: come with an unresolved brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a great degree, we're talking about TBI
so much now because of the roadside bombs
[SPEAKER_01]: used in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roadside bombs were a new tactic in Iraq
that, in addition to taking lives,
[SPEAKER_01]: often injured soldiers in ways that we
only found out later to be brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veterans across the country struggle daily
with intense symptoms from this brain
[SPEAKER_01]: trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also been talking about TBI more
because of the NFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Football players are coming forward to
talk about how repeated concussions from
[SPEAKER_01]: tackling can develop into an array of
brain injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even common folk like me get brain
injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was diagnosed with a traumatic brain
injury back in 2011 after a car accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky that mine was pretty mild,
but I still experienced migraines,
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea, dizziness, vertigo, loss of
memory, and exhaustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new way to treat traumatic brain
injuries that some neuroscientists believe
[SPEAKER_01]: will help resolve many of these cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microdosing cannabis to support the
endocannabinoid system, while also
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing psilocybin, the active
molecule in hallucinogenic mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: promises to help in the recovery of brain
injury by giving the brain what it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: published.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign up for updates to make sure you don't
miss an episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may remember Dr. Russo from Shaping
Fire episode 11 when we talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytocannabinoids and terpenes in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is a board-certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor at GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is now medical director at Phytex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania and the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts Medical School before
residencies in pediatrics in Phoenix,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona, and in child and adult neurology
at the University of Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a clinical neurologist in Missoula,
Montana for 20 years in a practice with a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong chronic pain component.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three-month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He joined GW as a full-time consultant in
2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as visiting professor
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk with Dr. Russo
about treating brain injury with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the introduction, I described
what a traumatic brain injury is and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of its symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that we know about injury is
that symptoms are usually the result of an
[SPEAKER_01]: unbalancing of one or more of the body's
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does a traumatic brain injury
impact the body systematically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's pretty encompassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to define a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the classic sense, a concussion used to
refer to a head injury in which there was
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know that that is not necessary to
have a post-concussive syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have all the symptoms of a
concussion without ever observably losing
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that needs to be made
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is true that there is some
correlation between the length of
[SPEAKER_00]: unconsciousness, if it occurs,
and how bad or how prolonged the
[SPEAKER_00]: post-traumatic syndrome will be
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these things do vary a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concussion, of course, involves the brain,
which is our most delicate body system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one of the most metabolically active
at any given point, something like 20% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood flow from the heart is going to
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's far out of proportion to its
weight compared to the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is our most important organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it is the area from which
our personality and all the aspects of our
[SPEAKER_00]: being derives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important in that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a situation in which the
balance in the brain is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the endocannabinoid
system comes in because its function
[SPEAKER_00]: really is to maintain that homeostasis,
that balance, which is so critical to
[SPEAKER_00]: proper functioning so that we can think,
relate to other people, do our jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the brain has that impact,
what is the experience of the brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of just talk, oh, the brain is
swelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if that's actually always
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the actual damage that takes place,
is it more than likely a swelling of the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, a bruising of the brain,
or a combination of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let's picture a situation,
the proverbial bowl of Jell-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the consistency of the brain in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have essentially what amounts to
a bowl of Jell-O that is in this rigid
[SPEAKER_00]: container that we call the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it gets hit, or specifically
when there's a sudden deceleration,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in a whiplash where there may not be
any actual contact to the head,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is thrown forward, thrown back,
and it's easy to understand how this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be highly disruptive to the delicate
fibers within.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some instances, if we do a
high-level scan of the brain, like an MRI,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may not see signs of swelling or
bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly in the more serious
injuries, there may be what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain contusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's medical ease for a bruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would look like a series of tiny
little hemorrhages on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there may be overt bleeding when larger
blood vessels are broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a continuum all the way from
seeing no overt anatomical change to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing gross evidence of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any of those things may be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the ones that don't show
a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not seeing the bruising or
ripping or things like that, is the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: from the concussion, is it merely a
chemical change of some sort that is
[SPEAKER_01]: causing what we consider some of the more
common symptoms of a light concussion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like vertigo and migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not physical damage, what causes
those symptoms to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess that the bottom line is we
would call it an electrochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if we're not seeing overt
anatomical changes, bearing in mind that a
[SPEAKER_00]: scan has only so much resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if we had the ability to look
at things microscopically in the living
[SPEAKER_00]: person, there might be changes that are
evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the victim of this, I'm afraid
it's more a scientific argument that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient may be reassured by medical
personnel at the emergency room,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that, look, your CAT scan was
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should get better at a time when
they feel dreadful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can persist for prolonged periods
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concussion is one of those things where
the patient may walk, may talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: look okay to their friends and family
members, but only the people closest to
[SPEAKER_00]: them may be aware of the degree of
impairment, which can be considerable,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the cases where there is no
visible damage on the tests that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also gets us to where I was
hoping we were going, which is if this is
[SPEAKER_01]: an electrochemical change, that makes a
lot of sense why the interplay with the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system can be so effective
and acute, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the realm of the ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main stimulatory neurotransmitter in
the brain is called glutamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need this for proper communication
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as in so many instances, there can be
too much of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under conditions of insults to the brain,
whether it be strokes or head injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: there tends to be a release of glutamate
to an excessive degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, this can drive pain,
neuropathic pain, and make it permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its worst forms, however, the glutamate
excess can be so great that it causes
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called an excitotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The excitot is excitatory
neurotransmitter, glutamate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toxicity is that it actually can
produce death of brain cells that were
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps marginally damaged in the injury,
but not dead yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the days after a head injury,
these can actually succumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a serious problem initially,
but one that looks worse after the passage
[SPEAKER_00]: of a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always saying that after you have
a concussion to watch somebody for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, because the symptoms may not show
up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they've got continually actively
dying cells, they may actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing a lessening of functioning
for a couple days after the actual trauma
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, certainly that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason that people need to be
watched after a head injury is there can
[SPEAKER_00]: be delayed bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the development of a subdural
hematoma, that is blood between the dural
[SPEAKER_00]: covering of the brain and the brain
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly dangerous in elderly
people, where it can come on slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a very sudden deterioration
that requires very rapid intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other immediate impacts that I
saw while doing my research for the show
[SPEAKER_01]: today was something that I'd never
actually seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with two different size pupils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pretty remarkable thing to see
photographs of, just as kind of a side,
[SPEAKER_01]: what causes that to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the situation I just mentioned,
the subdural hematoma is infamous for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it indicates damage on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this has not been present before and
suddenly appears acutely, it's a reason to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to an emergency room
expeditiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PTSD is often associated with traumatic
brain injuries and is treated similarly,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least now it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the symptoms from PTSD seem to arise
from the unbalancing of these same
[SPEAKER_01]: systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they essentially have the same cause or
do they have their own source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can have one, you can have the
other, you can have both together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, I guess the classic
situation where you'd have both would be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a battlefield situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where someone is concussed by an explosion
and has that coupled with PTSD due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sheer emotion and terror of the incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more violent the circumstances
surrounding the head injury, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely there is to be concomitant or
comorbid PTSD with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and I have talked about the
endocannabinoids system a lot and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different experiences that patients will
have that CBD is called for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting to go down the
common symptoms of PTSD because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: almost exactly the same as everything that
we would recommend CBD for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Memory fragmentation, flashbacks,
disassociation, hyperactive fight or
[SPEAKER_01]: flight, even hypervigilance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all the same kinds of things
that we would offer CBD to a patient for
[SPEAKER_01]: to help them relax their signaling systems
and kind of rebalance them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds to me like these are all in the
same pot of symptoms and by attempting to
[SPEAKER_01]: do our best to rebalance them,
we can kind of take care of them as a
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a lot of truth
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are similarities and
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In concussion, one of the cardinal
symptoms is some degree of memory loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in PTSD, it is hypervigilance to
memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in PTSD, it is helpful to have some THC
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps the person adjust, distancing
themselves from the traumatic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, one of the cardinal symptoms
of PTSD is intrusive dreams or nightmares.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the effects of THC is to suppress
REM sleep, REM sleep, rapid eye movement
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep associated with dreaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although that sounds radical,
there's not much danger with the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: REM suppression from THC, but certainly
this is helpful in reducing those
[SPEAKER_00]: intrusive dreams from which PTSD patients
suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, absolutely, cannabidiol
can be of great benefit in either
[SPEAKER_00]: post-concussive syndrome or post-traumatic
syndrome because of its ability to serve
[SPEAKER_00]: as an anti-anxiety agent, an antipsychotic
agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, its benefits on pain and
inflammation and its overall
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both instances, we are talking about
damage to the brain and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective agent certainly could be
of benefit in these situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, that is what we see when
patients pursue this kind of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move forward, I want to double
back because you said something that threw
[SPEAKER_01]: up a flag for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that THC tends to be a dream
suppressant, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with patients, I get anecdotal
evidence all the time that when somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: starts taking, say for example,
an indica tincture to help them get to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep and stay asleep more, it's not
uncommon to hear them come back and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, my dreams are so much more epic and
creative sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a second aspect of taking the THC
which could also lead to dreams or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: really just dream suppression and that
unique patient has got something unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, well, if we look at EEGs,
electroencephalograms, recording the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: waves, we do see a suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might diminish over the usage and
sometimes people just become more aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: their dreams in certain situations and so
it's hard to say in a given instance what
[SPEAKER_00]: might be operative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PTSD is often thought of as a
psychological issue, but the studies show
[SPEAKER_01]: that the hippocampus is damaged by extreme
stress as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no physical impact directly to
the hippocampus, for example, maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: take trauma from a blunt object on the
other side of your head, that must means
[SPEAKER_01]: that it must be a chemical impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of a chemical electrical impact
can actually cause physical damage in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hippocampus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, it's really hard to say and
we've got this mismatch between imaging
[SPEAKER_00]: studies which may be negative for showing
any visible damage, but yet functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient is definitely having problems
that we can trace to that area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid even in the 21st century,
our tools are not always terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, beyond scans, this is a
situation where EEGs, brainwave tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: are more sensitive than the imaging and
most sensitive of all are psychometric
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be the advanced tests of
memory, emotion, et cetera that are done
[SPEAKER_00]: by a neuropsychologist over the course of
many hours, but that is a very involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly people that have suffered these
kinds of traumas may benefit from that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of investigation, initially at
baseline and then say six months down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road to look at the degree of recovery
that might have occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the next two sets, we're going to
talk about using cannabis as a treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: and also psilocybin as a treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we go into those, I just want
to do a quick review of what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional treatments for a TBI as it's
done today and where do you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're missing all they can do,
which kind of brings up this conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and psilocybin as new and
advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And old treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm afraid that the current
armamentarium of conventional drugs for
[SPEAKER_00]: treating traumatic brain injury is not
very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can run the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the symptomatology is similar to
migraine, and so migraine preventive drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: are often used, but if anything,
post-traumatic headaches are harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat than garden variety migraines,
but these can include the tricyclic
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressant drugs like amitriptyline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can include a whole variety of
anticonvulsant drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also used sometimes to treat
migraine preventively, but these are not
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformly effective at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, people may try nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories, which are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're associated with side effects
like heartburn or worse, ulcers,
[SPEAKER_00]: even heart attacks and strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid they haven't been tremendously
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, in terms of the dizziness and
brain fog, these kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're often very, very poorly treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a situation where alternative
medicine can often do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in practice, I employed a lot
of these agents, such as using a chelated
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium that has a calming influence on
the brain, particularly in preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: headaches, whether post-traumatic or
migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, things like ginkgo biloba,
the herbal agent that's traditionally used
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat dementia in elderly people,
often can have a benefit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatology and particularly memory
impairment if it occurs in association
[SPEAKER_00]: with a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of things I
incorporated into my practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with consideration of cannabis
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem that all of those,
that long list of pharmaceuticals would
[SPEAKER_01]: also have the likelihood of knocking the
endocannabinoid system out of balance as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we hope that's not the case,
but suffice it to say that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs are not very effective and often can
contribute side effects of their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California and the expanded
Eden team has been designing and building
[SPEAKER_01]: industry leading solutions for cannabis
extraction ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you're buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braddock talk about the company's values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you will be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash Eden to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like podcasts like Shaping Fire,
chances are that you'll like audio books
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like with podcasts, audio books speak
to you, tell you stories and teach you
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, audible.com has an offer
that I wanna tell you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they're offering a trial of
their audio book service for absolutely

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our guest this week is neurologist and
cannabinoid researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
the traditional efforts that can be made
[SPEAKER_01]: after a traumatic brain injury to help
bring the systems back into balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during this set, we're going to talk
about cannabis as a treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Russo, you have described cannabis
as a helpful aid in both the prevention
[SPEAKER_01]: and the resolution of TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what are the modes in which cannabis
can help somebody who is experiencing this
[SPEAKER_01]: trauma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're very varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let's give a little background to
say that there's been extensive research
[SPEAKER_00]: done on traumatic brain injury using
animal models and showing disturbances in
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been going on for about as
long as the system has been known,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, we know that this kind of
injury produces deficits in
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid function and that when
these deficits are rectified, that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is clinical improvement in the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, additionally, beyond that,
and this was known back in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I was in practice, I noticed in
talking to patients who'd had mild
[SPEAKER_00]: concussions, for example, that
occasionally some would come to me with
[SPEAKER_00]: the story that, hey, something really
strange happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been having all these symptoms,
and one of my friends suggested that we
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a joint together, and I thought it
was a really bad idea, and yet we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I felt a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that about, they'd ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started hearing this from multiple
patients, and on the one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess logically it wouldn't make a lot
of sense to most people because we
[SPEAKER_00]: associate cannabis with worsening of
memory and creating a high, and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: it's illogical to a lot of people how this
could help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this instance, it became clear to
me that these patients were telling
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling stories about how this reduced
their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them would tell me that they felt
normal for the first time since the
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that the brain fog cleared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt clearer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to reduce their headache,
nausea, dizziness, and all the associated
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms that are just dreadfully
persistent when someone has this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reached the point that I had to include
cannabis as an alternative when discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with my patients in this situation,
and always prefacing it with, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is gonna sound weird, but,
and then we'd discuss cannabis and its
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to endocannabinoid function,
and how what we had learned from the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: science could really suggest that this
could be helpful, and that we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients saying that it did help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost uniformly, when patients tried
it, they reported benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly in the 90s, this was a very
unconventional idea, and things weren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: liberal politically as they might be now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very compelling, and I came to
think that this was one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments available for a very difficult
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine it'd be very
politically unpopular 20 years ago versus
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious what you think,
and maybe what you thought at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe how that's changed over the 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you think that them smoking a joint
and then removing their symptoms were
[SPEAKER_01]: either A, a function of them getting
support to their endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: or B, the fact that the symptoms that come
from ingesting cannabis actually directly
[SPEAKER_01]: relieve those symptoms kind of outside of
the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it is all related.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we closely examine what the
endocannabinoid system does, it's involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in generating headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects all these functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it's clear in a post-traumatic
syndrome that there is a severe
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance of homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know, again, from the experimental
work that there's a disturbance in
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus, supplementation from an external
source, in this instance with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis, makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's discuss for a minute the more
flagrant situation of repetitive head
[SPEAKER_00]: trauma as occurs in CTE, chronic traumatic
encephalopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of publicity about this
now, particularly in relation to retired
[SPEAKER_00]: football players that have developed this
syndrome of dementia, personality change,
[SPEAKER_00]: violent behavior, and we know that in the
brains of people who have died after
[SPEAKER_00]: having this condition, that there are some
very serious changes that occur over
[SPEAKER_00]: scarring, also the development of what are
called tau protein disturbances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tau proteins are part of microtubules in
the neurons of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're getting a little technical
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I wanted to mention is these
disturbances closely resemble what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: in the brains of elderly people with
Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are some similarities between
pathologically in chronic traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also know that cannabidiol in
particular seems to interfere with the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of these tau protein
abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a solid scientific basis for
thinking that some of this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive damage that we see in these
degenerative diseases, Alzheimer's on one
[SPEAKER_00]: hand and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
on the other, can possibly be slowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: or even arrested with cannabidiolus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're talking about memory,
when I was recovering from my brain
[SPEAKER_01]: injury, and I guess still to some extent
today, it feels like some of the memories
[SPEAKER_01]: are now filed just to the left or the
right of where I kept them prior to the
[SPEAKER_01]: injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is our memory filing system impacted
by a TBI?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it possible that cannabinoids could
help them as well, specifically the filing
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an interesting conjecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some basis for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's explain how it might well occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases like depression and
post-traumatic syndrome can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of disorders of plasticity of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plasticity means your resistance to
disturbance and the ability to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often been said that you're born with
all the neurons that you'll ever have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be regenerated, but we're
learning it isn't quite true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown that THC and other
cannabinoids increase plasticity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and may lead to what's called
neurogenesis, which, like it sounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: is production of new brain cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that throughout life,
particularly if we're continuing to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: that these neurons will create new
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the fundamental bases of
learning and memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we heal from this kind of injury,
you're making new connections and things
[SPEAKER_00]: do come back that seemingly might have
been lost to memory or ability before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems certainly the case that benefits
to the endocannabinoid system can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, this could come from properly
applied therapy with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to nail you down on dosage right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't care for this part very
much because individual patients respond
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabinoids in very different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would, with any particular
patient, you'd do a long intake with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also, you and I both don't know
that people are listening to this show who
[SPEAKER_01]: are dealing with traumatic brain injuries
and they are self-medicating, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it dialed in themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with those caveats, for someone who is
dealing with a recent TBI, what milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: and how often would you recommend of THC
and CBD, assuming whole plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: for someone who's starting to trying to
rebuild and trying to cause neurogenesis
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to decrease the symptoms that
they're going through because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you indicated, everyone's
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that the doses required
for THC to help someone with symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: management are usually very tiny,
not very high at all, probably a few
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams at most.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were smoking or vaporizing,
we'd probably have to do it every few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given that this is a subacute,
relatively long-lasting condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a chronic one, better would be use
of an oral agent or a tincture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth that would last a lot longer,
probably allowing dosing two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with respect to CBD, the dose
allowances would be much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite frankly, only extreme doses of CBD
are associated with any side effects or
[SPEAKER_00]: drug-drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly, if a person had access to a
CBD product, a dominant preparation that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have just a little THC and a lot
more CBD, this would probably be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as in so many situations, I would
probably recommend, if they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: ascertain the dosing, that they try not to
exceed 15 milligrams of total THC per day
[SPEAKER_00]: once they've titrated up, gotten used to
it, got used to the effects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, there could be quite a range
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't preclude that some people might
benefit from more, but those would be
[SPEAKER_00]: general guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking two and a half milligrams
to five milligrams taken maybe three times
[SPEAKER_01]: a day on the THC side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did say that CBD would be coming in at
a much higher amount, though, are you
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking more like 20 milligrams taken
three times a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be even higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we have one of the modern CBD
predominant chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that there's as much as 30
times the dose of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if there were 15
milligrams total of THC a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be 450 milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good healthy dose, and it would
likely have a lot of benefits in a
[SPEAKER_00]: severely affected patient with these kinds
of issues, particularly if we're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with someone who had advanced chronic
traumatic encephalopathy that was
[SPEAKER_00]: agitated, perhaps hallucinating or having
severe behavioral disturbances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could really make all the difference
and allow them to look a lot more normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not to say that it would totally
reverse the damage that they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: sustained, but I think we've all heard the
stories of how difficult these patients
[SPEAKER_00]: can be in the advanced stages of that
disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to hit on it just briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If folks are really interested in hearing
more of this part of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go back to episode 11,
where Dr. Russo and I talk about this at
[SPEAKER_01]: length.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to clarify that when we're
talking about CBD and THC and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about preparations, we are talking
about whole plant medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not talking about CBD extracted
from industrial hemp that is an isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that sure be my feeling about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very hard for someone using
one of those preparations to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper dosing, not to mention the risks of
contamination with pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend in this situation
is an organically grown whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract with proven accompanying analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is what patients deserve
and hopefully will be available soon in
more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see how, you know,
it's a shame that so many people still
[SPEAKER_01]: live in markets where you are not able to
get legal medical marijuana preparations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which creates this CBD from hemp market
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go ahead and take another
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_01]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_01]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_01]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil or ethyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so many responsibilities every
single day, that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into something as
deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there is more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and you're not ready to hire
someone full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt branding principals Kirsten Nelson
and Anthony Garcia are focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo packaging and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and Anthony will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, and keep them coming back to you
and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with blunt branding on three
projects now for very various clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal, instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making me a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every friend I've referred them
to has come back to thank me, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: just does not happen every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab a pen and paper because the
website address is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give blunt branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting edge technology in the
background that make all of this easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our guest this week is neurologist and
cannabinoid researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the last set, we were talking
about how cannabis in different modes can
[SPEAKER_01]: help support both the endocannabinoid
system and decrease and alleviate a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the symptoms associated with a TBI and
also help with the eventual resolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this next part is the part that I'm
especially excited about hearing because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard about psilocybin microdosing
for a couple years now, but trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's willing to actually talk
about it and explain how it alleviates a
[SPEAKER_01]: TBI, that's a rare thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to hear what you
have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, what is the mechanism by which
psilocybin from what otherwise people know
[SPEAKER_01]: of as hallucinogenic mushrooms,
how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it work to alleviate the symptoms
of a traumatic brain injury?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't exactly know, but let's set
the stage with some background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was apparent to me actually decades ago
that historically there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between the use of
psychedelics or hallucinogens and
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, these kinds of agents
which at high doses produce psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences at low doses were used to
treat headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it extends to the ergod alkaloids and
a whole bunch of others including
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mescaline, for example, was used as a
migraine preventive in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was part of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are interesting things and this
actually led me to my research in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Peruvian Amazon with the Machiganga tribe
and certainly they had the example of
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotrial leaves which contained
dimethyltryptamine, a psychedelic that's
[SPEAKER_00]: related to LSD and psilocybin and
mescaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be used as part of their
ayahuasca mix, the vine of the soul that's
[SPEAKER_00]: used in visionary sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in low doses they would drip the juice
from the leaves into the eye to treat a
[SPEAKER_00]: headache, also to increase the sensory
acuity for hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is this interesting parallel
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, there's this overlap between
migraine and post-traumatic headache
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly this kind of agent just on
that level would seem to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what science tells us is that this
kind of agent works on a thing called the
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin or 5-HT 2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are plenty of drugs that affect
that receptor that do not create these
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly nothing with such a
prolonged or long-lasting effect like
[SPEAKER_00]: people are noting after uses of these
agents, even in very small doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something going on that we
don't yet understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ideas though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that these agents are increasing
the plasticity of the brain much as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are opening up pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are opening up people's thought
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be that they're producing
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it be that they're actually creating
new connections in the brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the answers to these
questions, but those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just phenomenologically, what we note is
that many patients are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting relief of headaches and
better relief of these post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms in using very low doses of these
kinds of agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess most commonly this would be with
low-dose psilocybin, often in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of folks, they get the giggles
when talking about using hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms for this kind of patient relief
because folks are just imagining getting
[SPEAKER_01]: really high and having a psychedelic
experience from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about a dosage amount
that is lower than the threshold than you
[SPEAKER_01]: would take to have a hallucination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the patient experience anything or
would it be kind of transparent to them at
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper microdose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an example, a threshold dose for a
psychedelic experience with psilocybin is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally felt to be about 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: At lower doses, 2.5 to 10 milligrams could
vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient may not feel much of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have slight nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may feel that things are brighter,
more intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned with the matcha ginga
hunters, dripping psychotrial leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the heightening of the senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would fade after a time and often
be replaced by a persistent calm and
[SPEAKER_00]: positive emotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can go on for a considerable
length of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of some of the recent
research that indicates prolonged benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: on adjustment to end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or alleviation of chronic anxiety from
this kind of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be a relationship there
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is psilocybin normally measured?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm sure there's folks listening
who have had a brain injury like I have
[SPEAKER_01]: and who can't help but think, all right,
well, I know where I can get mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: where I live because they grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're gonna have to look up
some sort of preparation that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is the only way to get a proper dosage
to pull it out of the mushroom into its
[SPEAKER_01]: crystallized form and weigh it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there a rule of thumb that folks can
use as a starting place for
[SPEAKER_01]: self-experimentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if someone's gonna use
mushrooms, they need to be with someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who can positively identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: With psilocybin mushrooms, there's a
certain built-in safety factor in that
[SPEAKER_00]: they will notice a bluing reaction of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the surface is bruised, it rapidly
turns blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a diagnosis or diagnostic
test, but this does not replace the need
[SPEAKER_00]: for someone very experienced in mushroom
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, if the species is known,
there are written guidelines on what the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative concentration might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of resources, some of the
older books on this, such as Jonathan Otz,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacotheon has dosage guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, some of Paul Stamets' older
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online, there would be information from a
couple of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be MAPS, M-A-P-S.org,
and also the Beckley Foundation.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have both done extensive work in
medical applications of the psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: and specifically psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And searches on those websites would
provide a lot more information.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for folks who are listening,
if you're in your car or you're running or
[SPEAKER_01]: something and you're dying to have those
written down, if you just go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: website at shapingfire.com, and go to the
episode page for this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those are going to be linked there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we move on from psilocybin,
Ethan, I guess since this is the part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the topic today that I know the least
about, because I've spent most of my time
[SPEAKER_01]: studying cannabis and not mushrooms,
I want to toss this question in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: mop up anything I may have missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I not asked you about using
psilocybin to alleviate TBI that maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: should have asked you or that you think
would be good to finish off this section
[SPEAKER_01]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm afraid we should really include
some caveats, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if somebody has these growing in their
lawn, they're not illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you pick them with intent to
ingest them, they are illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still considered a schedule
one forbidden drug in this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: much as cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a combination of a very
unconventional therapy, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: if too much is taken, is going to produce
a psychedelic experience that the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be prepared for on the one hand,
and on the other hand, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially could get them in trouble with
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it's my duty to impart knowledge
about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the future, we're going to find
approved medical indications for both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these sets of substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, people need to be
aware of them and perhaps help with the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort to see the proper research is done
and see if we can learn enough to make
[SPEAKER_00]: these accessible to people who really need
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during our next set, we're going to
talk about the research and trials that
[SPEAKER_01]: are happening now for both of these
solutions, but we're going to take our
[SPEAKER_01]: last break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is neurologist Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_01]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the podcast is young, but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_01]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.

out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is neurologist and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the last set, we talked a lot
about how psilocybin can be used to
[SPEAKER_01]: alleviate traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, we were talking about
cannabis and the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we were talking about in the last
set, unfortunately, both of these
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments are still based on schedule one
drugs and, you know, possessing these
[SPEAKER_01]: using them are still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know that on rare occasions,
the government will give research
[SPEAKER_01]: permission to folks who want to start
looking for medical efficacy for these
[SPEAKER_01]: types of naturally occurring substances so
that maybe the case can be made to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: it from the schedule one like people are
discussing today for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, my question for you is,
you know, are there already research and
[SPEAKER_01]: trials happening now for psilocybin that
there's anybody working on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just simply how you learned about
it through anecdotal evidence speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, your patients and really
there's not much going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think it's getting the
attention it deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some recent studies done
with psilocybin and other psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, particularly at Johns Hopkins
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Baltimore and some in Switzerland that
have looked at these agents, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to PTSD, adjustment to end of
life situations, anxiety associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer and things of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really, to my knowledge,
haven't been studies of these in
[SPEAKER_00]: post-traumatic syndromes, some in PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are interested in this,
the place to always look to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on is clinicaltrials.gov,
so clinicaltrials.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a government website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a requirement now for companies
doing this kind of investigation to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the information about their clinical
trials that are planned or in process to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the information on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can get an idea of what might be
going on and whether there's a possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of them trying one of these substances in
the context of a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be obvious advantages there in
terms of the legality, being in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled situation with experienced
clinicians and all the possible backup
[SPEAKER_00]: they might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were an emergency situation to
arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that the military would be
probably looking into the psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: solution as well, because I know they're
already looking at using cannabidiol in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field because having it in your system
before a concussion can actually help in
[SPEAKER_01]: your likelihood of getting over the TBI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those military folks, they've got a
history with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can imagine that it'd be a short jump
for them to be interested in psilocybin as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, especially with that interesting
little bit that you added about how
[SPEAKER_01]: dripping it into the eye increases your
ability to see at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't honestly see them doing this
anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems to be a leap of faith beyond
which is really likely to occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one can dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that with taking cannabinoids,
you can have an overmedicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable experience that'll go away
in a couple hours if you take too much
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't die from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that also true with mushrooms,
that if someone is experimenting with
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing, that if they miss it,
chances are they'll have a potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable, but also very possibly nice
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like it works on the
respiratory system or would stop the heart
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is psilocybin relatively safe to be
working with as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of actual toxicity, as you
mentioned, breathing sensation,
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with the heart, liver,
et cetera, actually quite safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest danger is bad trip,
people freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is self-limited, meaning it will
pass and responds generally to talking
[SPEAKER_00]: down, so-called.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly could lead to emergency
room visits, particularly if the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: has no prior experience with this kind of
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time to mention that no one
should ever do this alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a so-called guide, someone who
is not partaking of the substance that can
[SPEAKER_00]: run interference for them, make sure that
they're safe and reassured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the best safety measure of
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well said there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for folks who are listening like I
am and really wanting more of these
[SPEAKER_01]: studies on psilocybin and even the
endocannabinoid system to be going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as people taking some kind of
action, does it do any good or is it even
[SPEAKER_01]: the right person to call your legislator
and tell them that you want psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: approved for brain injury research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that an over broad kind of activism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular somebody in the
government who would be allowing this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of research that we could pinpoint our
calls or contacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as it is now, some of these clinical
trials are approved by the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration and that can only happen if
the applicant proves that the possible
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits outweigh the dangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been done, both with cannabis
and with some of the psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are interested in this area
beyond getting involved in a clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial themselves, certainly I'd recommend
that they join the Beckley Foundation and
[SPEAKER_00]: MAPS and make generous contributions
because that is the reason behind these
[SPEAKER_00]: two organizations and is their basic
mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being on the show, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your experience is really valuable and I
know I'm not alone in appreciating your
[SPEAKER_01]: willingness to come out and share it with
us.
