[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have decided to move beyond
simply supplementing your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate with bottled synthetics and you
find your way to living soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: things can get pretty messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost, wild-crafted nutrient teas,
and fermentations all have smells that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very, um, potent, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that many of them stink,
but they do smell intense, exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: strange, and very wildly alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with organic and living inputs is
a strong reminder that life begets life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in that spirit that I offer today's
episode, entitled Dead Bodies and Poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about cannabis
health, business, and technique

[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad is a living soils educator and owner
of Keep It Simple Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: KIS Organics is an edible nursery,
production greenhouse, outdoor preschool,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic hydro shop, and online living soil
inputs seller based in Redmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad is also host of the Cannabis
Cultivation and Science podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad's a sought-after speaker on every
facet of living soils, and we're thrilled
[SPEAKER_00]: to have him here today to talk about
animal inputs from bones and blood to poop
[SPEAKER_00]: and flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last note, this week's episode simply
does not sound as good as our episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When setting up for the interview,
I missed that my side of the conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: was being recorded by my laptop microphone
and not my fancy studio microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more echo than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's tolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this is your first time listening
to Shaping Fire, I don't want you to think
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is how it normally sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, Tad does most of the talking
during the episode and his microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening and enjoy the
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really glad that you could peel
off some time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to be talking about
a lot of animal inputs that can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing cannabis or anything today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you have taught me that one
of the important things is to always start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though this is not a soil test
show, would you just give a quick summary
[SPEAKER_00]: of why people should have their soil
looked at so they understand what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate you giving me a minute
to talk about this because I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I want to make clear is that
there's different types of soil tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: they all give slightly different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Malik 3 tests, Bray Olson,
a bunch of different types of tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever test you go with,
you need to keep testing with the same lab
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to get consistent results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is really the foundation that
allows you to use a lot of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients appropriately, because if you
know what's in your soil, then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: amend that soil to make up for any
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think soil testing is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that we like the best is Logan
Labs Standard Soil Test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like $25, so it's not terribly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will tell you everything that's
in the soil, including your trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on the results from that,
you'll know what you need to do to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil into the range you want it to be
in for whatever you happen to be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll help you with
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can't do that, you know,
I'm available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's other people in the industry
that can, you know, help you understand
[SPEAKER_01]: those tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use that information to
utilize some of the other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing while I've got you here,
I want to ask you is one of the questions
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me what the three numbers,
the NPK percentages on the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you go ahead and field that
question for folks who may be listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: show new to fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you kind of said it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three numbers, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are required.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, state law here in
Washington, Oregon, or whatever state
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those numbers will tell you what
percentage of that nutrient is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: guaranteed in that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you have to be a little bit careful
in the cannabis industry, because if they
[SPEAKER_01]: put five five five on the label,
that means there's at least five percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there could be more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the things that we're going to
talk about today, things like these
[SPEAKER_01]: different animal manures in meals,
they tend to be they tend to be not
[SPEAKER_01]: overinflated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the cannabis industry, you have to
be careful because someone may say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my proprietary nitrogen source
is better than another one that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: five five five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could be because they're putting
in excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those numbers just give you the minimums
that's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the state tests for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you, too, for being
willing to come on a show called Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodies and Poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that I've been thinking
about these kind of nutrients for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about it as,
you know, the animals give give everything
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can grow our cannabis in these
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of the things like
especially the feces and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the animal gives off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these things like our first
example, insect frass, it's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect frass is something that was new
to me just this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used it for the first time and I saw
incredible results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so why don't we start there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you tell us about insect frass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's something that's
relatively new to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry, too, and something that I
didn't know a lot about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, essentially the frass is the
waste or excess of what's left over in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the source that we have is up
in Canada and they're growing out black
[SPEAKER_01]: soldier flies and black soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have mouths.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larvae will eat just about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what is left over in that
process, they're calling the frass after
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that the insect has eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of it like insect compost,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the great thing about it is you're
getting that NPK, you're getting calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a slower release source of these
nutrients and it's really high in chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people talk about chitin as something
that's really important because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: related to there's some research that
shows it supports systemic acquired
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance or SAR, which is shown to help
reduce or suppress certain pests or fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specific enzyme that is created by
these bacteria, fungi, and other
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms that are specific for
breaking down the chitin that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: see in insect frass, in crab or crustacean
meal, things with shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the insect frass, I picture it
as just being a bunch of dried up soldier
[SPEAKER_00]: fly carcasses that are then put through a
grinder and comes out as a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is that a good picture of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they choose soldier flies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they particularly have got these
healthy nutrients in their bodies or is
[SPEAKER_00]: insect frass made out of any insect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, it's any insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only worked with the black soldier
fly frass, but the frass is really think
[SPEAKER_01]: of it like with earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the leftover casting or the or the
poop, more or less, or the compost that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not been consumed by the insect itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will get some dead bodies and
things like that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, what they do is the larvae
is harvested and that is then sold as
[SPEAKER_01]: grubs or as a fertilizer to the industry
separate from the frass itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my expectation is actually not
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like adult soldier fly body
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their poop and then also anything
that's left over from the larval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, extra shells and mucuses
and random stuff like whatever's left in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bin then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what a weird product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the crazy thing about it, for example,
the source that we use, my buddy up at
[SPEAKER_01]: Whistler Medical Marijuana Facility,
he sent it off to his friend in Quebec who
[SPEAKER_01]: runs a laboratory and they tested it and
found that and I haven't had a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: play with it myself yet, but they tested
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, it came back with a higher
microbial charge even than worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of good beneficial
microorganisms in it and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other things that you have to consider
when using a product like this is not only
[SPEAKER_01]: are you getting the NPK and the micro and
macronutrients, but you're also getting
[SPEAKER_01]: this wonderful diversity of
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding the insect frass was the only major
difference in my last crop and the depth
[SPEAKER_00]: of green in my plants was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike anything that I had acquired up to
that point and I actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: give a lot of that up to the insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I bought your insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it from you at the KIS store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so anyway, so that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to point out to people
when working with insect frass is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets taken up into the air quickly like
perlite does and so you either want to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle the stuff really gently or wear a
mask because you can get that stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: inhale it easily and that's gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff we're going to talk
about today probably should be used with a
[SPEAKER_01]: mask in general just to avoid particulate
in your lungs at the very least,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's not something terribly gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on from insect frass to
another one of my favorites, worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's worm castings is
such an elegant way to say poop,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, because it casts off what it
doesn't need anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a bit about worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, worm castings are, they're the
greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: For an organic gardener, they're probably
my number one tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about worm casting to
consider is they're not all created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you mentioned, worm castings are
essentially worm poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually coming out of commercial
facilities or people will have their own
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicomposting bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more the worms process that
material that's put into the bin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's going to be a difference
between worm castings made from,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, finished compost versus ones made
from food scraps, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what went into the worm
castings, I think, will help a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: determining the quality of them as well as
how long the worms have worked that
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know for us, like we took some of
that Ole Mountain fish compost in these
[SPEAKER_01]: giant 400 gallon smart pots and then we
put worms in there and then added some
[SPEAKER_01]: basalt and some calcium sources and some
neem cake and a few other ingredients in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then let the worms work it for
over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time it was done, we had a
really great worm casting product we were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do they normally say on the bags the
source of what the worms were eating so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can judge the quality or do like,
you know, lower quality ones not mention
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with the really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yeah, you know, or all organic
finished compost fed or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very good industry in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not standardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do on your own to do your own
due diligence is you can call the company
[SPEAKER_01]: and find out what they're feeding their
worms, what they're bedding their worms
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at the worm
castings, and this is going to vary based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the type of worms, like African worms,
for example, have really big poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really easy to see versus
things like red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have much smaller poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're looking for when you're
evaluating worm castings visually is it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be a bunch of tiny little dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it looks like regular compost,
there's a bunch of other, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: woody materials and things in there,
then that compost just really isn't mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: castings at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas it should just look like a bunch
of little tiny brown or black dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that actually that's what I was
going to ask you next is that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're looking at it, sometimes when
I'll buy it, it looks like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: little pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it looks like a really dark
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you how you get the
castings out of the compost to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm realizing is what you're
telling me is that they don't remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: castings from the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how long have they had
the worms work that compost so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of castings in the compost
number is really high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll put it through a variety of
filters or sifts essentially that will
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the larger particulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got to keep in mind a lot of the
worm castings are being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms aren't being used specifically
for making castings, but rather for making
[SPEAKER_01]: more worms that they can then sell the
worms to, you know, gardeners or sell them
[SPEAKER_01]: to fishermen and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what the facility is really set
up for can help determine sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the of the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everyone should have their own worm
bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even just use horse manure as an
initial bedding, which is really easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: find locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing your own worms is a great
option for most growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're if you're new to
probiotic growing, it is an easy entryway
[SPEAKER_00]: into starting to play around this stuff
that won't cost you a lot of money and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually gives you something that's really
valuable for both your cannabis and your
[SPEAKER_00]: food garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaving Fire and my
guest today is Ted Hussey of Keep It
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaving Fire episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of well cared
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Forever Flowering Greenhouses to
partner with folks who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable reputation as knowledgeable
and easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash FFG to
find out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I certainly still enjoy smoking
joints, I moved over to using vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was a little different than
burning the flower and in the end I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided I preferred it for daily use,
especially because I have asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly though, I could taste my
flower so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to express to you how
significantly different cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good terpene profile tastes when vaped
instead of burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have brought my vape with me to visit
growers and they are astonished by the
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity of taste and they say they feel
like they're tasting their flower for the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AirVape Vaporizer from airvapeusa.com
is a great device to use on the go or at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pick it up, it feels satisfying
like a medical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't flimsy like many vapes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how the flower is inserted in the
top instead of the bottom so it travels a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter path to my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the cannabis at the top, I get a hit
that feels more substantial even though
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just inhaling vapor and not
full-bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I use this vape for flower,
hash, and concentrates, I really like that
[SPEAKER_00]: the digital control for the temperature is
right there on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three clicks of the button and it fires up
to the temperature I specify really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vape concentrates are a milder experience
than dabbing, but you still get the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and you're hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the taste is great as would be
expected with a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if I'm chatting or distracted
while it's heating up, it lets me know
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ready for another nice
pocket-sized vaporizer, consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: Airvape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Airvape X has just come out and
it's gorgeous and includes many updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more about the Airvape
vaporizer at airvapeusa.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Tad Hussie of Keep It Simple
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we talked about soil
tests and NPK percentages, insect frass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here during set two, we're going to move
more towards the seaside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to talk about is
crab and oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are subsections of both,
but can you explain just generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad, why we like shells to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're very different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about crab or
crustacean meal, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's going to be high in
calcium, but also going to give you some
[SPEAKER_01]: slow-release nitrogen and, again,
that chitin, the same thing we found in
[SPEAKER_01]: the insect frass, which we already
covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 4% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good way to get that
slow-release nitrogen and also encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: that chitin in a specific bacteria and
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, Nan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a real difference between the
crushed shell, because I've seen it in
[SPEAKER_00]: bags and it's just shell bits,
versus I've also seen people sell flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm assuming we're not baking bread
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it come in these two different
forms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and this is a good thing to be aware
of across all of these different products
[SPEAKER_01]: and meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in general, when you're adding things
into your soil, is really the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between... We haven't talked about oyster
shell yet, but oyster shell flour versus
[SPEAKER_01]: actual oyster shells, it's really the
surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That oyster shell flour is going to be
broken down much faster and be more
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plant sooner than the
actual oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oyster shells are calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I meant to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something to be available over
a period of a series of months,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you would want to use the oyster
shells, whereas the oyster shell flour
[SPEAKER_01]: will still take some time to become
available, but it will be much faster
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a greater surface area for
these bacteria and microorganisms to start
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a really great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the crushed shell pieces is more
of a time release nutrient, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: flour is going to be instantly and fully
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When choosing between crab and oyster
shell, what do you teach people how to
[SPEAKER_00]: come to their decision on which to go
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to touch on one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be really clear, calcium in
general takes a while to become available
[SPEAKER_01]: when added in these forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say more available, we're still
talking weeks to months in general with
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if you're looking for a
slow release nitrogen source, then that
[SPEAKER_01]: crab crustacean meal is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for just calcium,
then you could use something like oyster
[SPEAKER_01]: shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all right, but you would get the
calcium with the crustacean shell too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't everybody just go with
crustacean shell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something special that's unique
about oyster shell that you can't get from
[SPEAKER_00]: the crab shell?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with the crab shell though is
you are getting 4% nitrogen, so you would
[SPEAKER_01]: end up with more nitrogen relative to the
amount of calcium you needed.
I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to mention is...
[SPEAKER_01]: Oyster shell is primarily just calcium
carbonate, and it's a lot easier to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that calcium directly from agricultural
lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both mined products, but you can
go down and buy a bag of agricultural lime
[SPEAKER_01]: at your local feed store or any kind of
garden center, and it might be $8 to $10
[SPEAKER_01]: for a 50-pound bag, so really affordable,
whereas that oyster shell flower may cost
[SPEAKER_01]: you $15 to $25 a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more affordable sources for
gardeners and farmers on the calcium side
[SPEAKER_01]: than necessarily using oyster shell
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will probably come up a couple times
today, but is there such thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably harvested crab and oyster
shell products versus unsustainably
[SPEAKER_00]: farmed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that we need to be aware
of when buying it, or are there just so
[SPEAKER_00]: much leftovers of that from the other
industries that it's just stuff that would
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise get thrown away?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked into the crab crustacean
meal processing enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know it is leftover byproduct of the
fishing and seafood industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the oyster shell flower,
I know it's a mined product, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mining these old ocean beds that
are now on land, so they're not any more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable than the agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, there's not a huge advantage to
using oyster shell flower over other lime
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all mined products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When doing research for this show,
I came across a variety that I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: actually heard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossil shell flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually excited to find out what this
is because I imagine that deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, you've got some animal that died
near the beach, and then years of
[SPEAKER_00]: compression, and now you've got a fossil,
and somehow they dig this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the story with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably already seen it on shelves
and heard of it under the name
[SPEAKER_01]: diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're essentially the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a legal term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the diatomaceous earth,
the cool thing about it is it is 33%
[SPEAKER_01]: silica and 19% calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some of these trace minerals in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has some beneficial nutrients and
things for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to keep in mind though is even
though it's so high in silica,
[SPEAKER_01]: only about a quarter of a percent is
actually in a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really getting that high dose
of silica that you could from other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, but it also works as a natural
desiccant as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put it on an insect or use it to
top dress your soil and the insects walk
[SPEAKER_01]: through it, it creates little micro cuts
because of these tiny diatoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will eventually cause them to
dehydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a couple different stories in
terms of the process of how it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's the one that most people tell
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an effective pesticide in that
regard, but once you water it,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, when you top dress with it,
it's no longer as effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a couple different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know people who use it for that
cutting ability when they're fighting soil
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats because I guess moving around that
stuff cuts off their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that have the same thing to do for
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be using gloves when handling
diatomaceous earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so concerned about your skin,
but in general you want to wear a
[SPEAKER_01]: respirator especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the mistake of one time using it
for mites and gnats and not wearing eye
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually when I was done my eyes were
super bloodshot and it was kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: this oh duh moment after I was finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time it didn't even occur to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to protect yourself when using
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that sounds really uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blows back into your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's in your eyes and it's all these
micro cuts on your ... That doesn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would somebody use diatomaceous earth
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's its target usage other than a
protectant on the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it also a heavy nitrogen fixer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing a lot of people using it as
a particular fertilizer so much as you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see it in the pet industry for dealing
with organic fleece solution or powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also see it for dealing with mites
and gnats and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does add some of these things
especially that silica that will slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: break down over time and the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are starting to use it more and
more in their soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's fossil shell, how actually is it
made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really compressed shells along the
seashore that they go and they mine
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's got 10,000 years of
compounded shells in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really what it is or is the name a
misnomer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these diatoms or tiny shells that
were left on these ocean beds from I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: guessing thousands, maybe hundreds of
thousands of years old now that are now on
[SPEAKER_01]: land and mined.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are mined products still that we're
talking about unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to actual fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different ways that I've
seen people work with fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen fish emulsions and meal and fish
bone and fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even saw this old guy here on Bashan
Island who just took the fish guts from
[SPEAKER_00]: his salmon fishing and just chucked them
in the hole that he was about to plant his
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant in and just threw them in
there raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh man, I'm not sure if you
should age that first or do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he said that's how he's been doing it
for 20 years and he grows great flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to complain, but it was
weird to see just the whole carcasses put
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just as simply throw fish
trailings into the hole where you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant or in almost all cases,
do you want to process that fish somehow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just rotting underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old school gardening move
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think it dates back to a Native
American culture originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never personally done that,
but I do use a lot of fish products both
[SPEAKER_01]: in our soils and in my own gardening for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a fish emulsion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that term thrown around a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, when you see fish fertilizer
that's a liquid, it comes in two forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either going to be fish emulsion or
fish hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big difference is the emulsion uses a
heat process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That material is heated up, which can
destroy some of the enzymatic qualities of
[SPEAKER_01]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, fish emulsion tends to be a
little bit stinkier than fish hydrolysate
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, but it is going to have a higher
nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fish hydrolysate on the other end
uses cold water processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, specific enzymes that break
down all the leftover fish bits and
[SPEAKER_01]: carcasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, for some silly reason with
bureaucracy, you're allowed to stabilize
[SPEAKER_01]: it with phosphoric acid and still have it
be considered organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have a higher phosphorus content
than you would in the fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quick way to tell really quickly just
staring at two fish products is if it has
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher phosphorus than nitrogen,
it's probably hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has a high nitrogen and no
phosphorus, it's probably emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both come in deodorized or less stinky
versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using these fish products, they're still
going to smell like fish a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're not going to be terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's really important to
mention is that fish hydrolysate is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a really, really good microbial
food specifically for fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will grow great fungal hyphae and
compost teas and also help promote them in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving along to fish meal then,
is that just simply fish ground up?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I understand, it's literally
ground fish, leftover ones that they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't use for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like the old school version of
just chucking the fish in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a shelf stable package.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally like a brown powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not terribly stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the powders are nearly as smelly
as the liquids in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about fish meal is it's
10-4-0 and it's a fast-release nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: source, relatively speaking, compared to
other nitrogen sources out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, what we're talking about by
comparing these different fish products is
[SPEAKER_00]: not really the same product in four
different packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really talking about the emulsions
versus the... How do you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrostate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the technical correct
pronunciation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish emulsion versus the hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be what NPK you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the fish meal takes that and adds the
additional variable of how quickly you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though these are all fish-based,
really, it sounds like the nature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing has a lot to do with which
product you end up choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one on my list is fish compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting idea because the
compost that we have where I live,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told not to put any animal
products in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the story with fish compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with one company here in
Washington that makes a fish compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's so great about that product
is the fact they let it age for at least
[SPEAKER_01]: two years before they sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's not so much the fact they're
using fish, which is great, but the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that they allow that material to be fully
composted through static composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't beat nature in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find it comes in with a lot of really
good beneficial micro and macro
[SPEAKER_01]: invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little bit higher in
nitrogen than some of the other strictly
[SPEAKER_01]: food waste or plant waste compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I wanted to mention that I
forgot to was in regards to fish
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrolysate, that is my go-to bottled
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a very simple bloom nutrient,
fish hydrolysate could replace a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bloom nutrients out there on the
market as just a swap for a quarter of the
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier too that the liquids
tend to smell fishier.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I would consider that a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells fishy, I'm thinking it's got
more of the active life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, of the original fish than
some of the overly processed powders which
[SPEAKER_00]: have lost that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that the liquids are just
going to hold more of the essential oils
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fish throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I'm right, but that's
certainly how I would go when I was buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get higher oil content,
which is great, but the one thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed that reminded me of the fact I
tested this freeze-dried or flash-dried
[SPEAKER_01]: fish powder that was carried in a local
garden center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at it under the microscope
by using it as a food source for soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, and I found that I did not get
very good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how different of a microbial
food, for example, the fish hydrolysate is
[SPEAKER_01]: than the fish emulsion or the fish meal or
even this freeze-dried product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can really vary across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, fish hydrolysate is my go-to
for liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if I want nitrogen, I'll go with fish
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want calcium, you can use something
like phosphorus than you can use fish bone
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, which is another fish product while
we're on the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They remove all the fleshy bits of the
fish and they just go with the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that so you make a more targeted
nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think it's a by-product they were
able to make into a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to use land animal or
mammal-based phosphorus sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the fish bone meal is a really good
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know of one other non-animal based
phosphorus source, which would be soft
[SPEAKER_01]: rock phosphate, but that has its own
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish bone meal, to me, is really one of
the best phosphorus options out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners and growers beyond compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we leave the seaside and move
inland again, let's talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been using bat guano for
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my world, seabird guano is
something that seems to have come more
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you first speak to why people like
using these seaside guanos to begin with
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what the difference is between
the bat and the seabird guano?
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been using guanos for years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear a lot of old school growers that
talk about how the guano is what separates
[SPEAKER_01]: their bud from everyone else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guanos are great because they're good
fast-release sources of a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: micro and macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the great examples,
too, of why a soil test is so helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: because they come in a variety of
different NPK values depending on where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're sourced from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see Peruvian seabird guano that
has 10% phosphorus, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas a Mexican bat guano or seabird
guano may be 10% nitrogen and no
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what habitat's coming out can
really determine the nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guanos will vary across the board in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm personally not a huge fan of guanos
and I'll share why.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, it's not a rapidly renewable
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: These caves lose their biodiversity when
they're harvested and that can destroy
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the ecology in the caves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if it's harvested when the bats are
present, the bats may not want to return
[SPEAKER_01]: back to that cave to care for their young
or they may abandon that cave altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's a source of economy for a
lot of these local and indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, it can cause a lot of
respitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cause regulatory health problems
and other things for the people actually
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before people get super mad at me,
I will say there are safe and sustainably
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested ways of doing that process,
but it's impossible to know when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up a bag on the shelf how that stuff
has been processed without calling the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer and really doing a lot of
research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like guano is one of those
things that we really want to know our
[SPEAKER_00]: producer because we want to know where and
how it was produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we want to know what the makeup is
because it sounds like guanos are not ...
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just swap them out one for the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one is going to be its own product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to think about too is the
microbial aspect of bat guanos or seabird
[SPEAKER_01]: guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people swear that the reason they
love these guanos is because they bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: specific microbes that are really good for
bringing out all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your final bud, that being said,
you also have the potential for pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: like E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a specific one to bats called
histoplasmosis that's a fungal spore that
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty nasty that you don't want to
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had asked me before the show about
guanos and one of the questions you asked
[SPEAKER_01]: was, are there any requirements around
microbial testing for these pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I called the Department of Agriculture in
Oregon and was talking to the guy and he
[SPEAKER_01]: said that they don't actually have any
requirements for that to register guano as
[SPEAKER_01]: a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some with the USDA in terms
of what they allow you to legally import.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked into it that far,
but be aware with these guano products,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could be bringing in some potentially
dangerous pathogens as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I had Kevin Jodry from
Wonderland Nursery Humboldt County up here
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a talk a few months back during the
summer all on how to breed for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that one of the things that you
have to be really careful about with guano
[SPEAKER_00]: is how much it influences the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it'll turn up your terpenes,
but it only turns up a particular spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that he remembers way back,
I think he said it was in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yester time anyway, when back guano
became really popular in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then suddenly and oddly, people's cannabis
flowers started tasting very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like, hmm, I wonder if that's
because we've all started using guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the overseas manufacturer for the
bulk of the guano that was coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed where they were getting it
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then suddenly in one season, all these
terpene profiles all changed at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all realized how much using guano was
encouraging certain terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: discouraging other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For him, he's all like, eh, I don't really
want anything in my fertilizers that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to artificially, air quotes,
artificially change the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, because I want to taste the full
spectrum of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin went on with things that he has
found that can be used as a nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that wasn't going to spike certain
terpenes and not others, thus not having
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant properly express itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that really interesting,
both the fact of adding products like
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenator that does that, that will turn
up a certain spectrum of terpenes while
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing the others, but also the
influence on agriculture as a whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: as agriculture changes from one nutrient
being invoked to another, it will really
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the agricultural product,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think from an ethical
perspective, at the very least,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're talking about importing these
things, they have to have a massive fossil
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel cost just to get them to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we can find a lot of these
same nutrients in other sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which we've already talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going to talk about some
other options too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's replacements for bat
guanos and seabird guanos out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can find more locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also a lot of the reason that
you're getting these terpene changes is
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the high sulfur levels that you're
seeing in bat guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big link between sulfur and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been established.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I think you can play with
yourself as a grower if you're doing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, is you can experiment with
different sulfur levels in your soils and
[SPEAKER_01]: see how that expression changes your final
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Tad Hussie of Keep
[SPEAKER_00]: It Simple Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first
organically-derived microbial inoculant
[SPEAKER_00]: that focuses on your plant's nutrient
cycling processes to release soil
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and other micronutrients from
their bound forms, making them more
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well-known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they are extracted from real
plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind used
during the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is other companies terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you stack those terpenes to make
a blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also has strain specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset Sherbet
and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your questions will get answered fast
and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some alpha-pinene so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Tad Hussey of
Keep It Simple Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come inland a little bit from the
ocean shore and let's talk about blood
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it come from and what are we
using it for, Tad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, blood meal is a byproduct of the
meat or slaughterhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about 13% fast release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of gardeners I know will use it
in veg as a way of increasing that
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of nasty in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to get it wet and on your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is like a reddish powder that you
can add into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it simply blood that's been dehydrated?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much threat is there for it to carry
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't heard of any issues
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't have a lot of
growers that I know using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things a lot of people
have ethical issues around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've worked with some really good
tomato growers and such that would put a
[SPEAKER_01]: small amount in with their tomato starts
as a way to give them a little boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always kind of got the impression
that it's kind of like an old school
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, especially with lower income
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that they can afford to use
that once dried is pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've already got a farm and farm
animals and you're going to slaughter them
[SPEAKER_00]: for your family, this is a ready
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is blood meal moving more out of vogue
because we've got other things that do the
[SPEAKER_00]: same work but with more benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's hard for me to say on an
agricultural level, but I just personally
[SPEAKER_01]: choose not to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay a little bit more to use the fish
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not all that cheap either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just something that I don't
personally like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're desperate for more
nitrogen, there's other sources like cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and nitrogen fixing legumes and
things like that or fish meal that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even alfalfa meal and some of these
other plant meals will bring in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it matter what type of blood it is,
like what animal, or is it just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't really delved into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a 50 pound bag that's full of blood
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't gone beyond that with it,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're on the farm, let's talk
about feather meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first read this, I mean,
I had to go to Wikipedia and look it up
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm really like, is it really
feathers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears to be yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another byproduct of the poultry industry
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the cool thing about feather meal is
it's a slow release nitrogen product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want nitrogen right away,
blood meal is going to give you that or
[SPEAKER_01]: fish meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want something that's going to
be released over a period of months,
[SPEAKER_01]: because from an outdoor gardening
perspective, nitrogen is something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: leached out of your soil every year when
it rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't stick around in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a farmer or gardener, we have to add
it every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feather meal is great because you could
put it in at the beginning of the season
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll be available slowly over a
period of months rather than all at once
[SPEAKER_01]: right at the beginning of the crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it chicken feathers or is it many
different types of birds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, Shango, I don't know all these
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never looked into that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a brown powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't even know it was feather meal
or it was made from feathers just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a little bit of an off odor,
but it's not terribly unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that you don't know
as much about blood and feather meal as
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things that we've talked about
that you know a ton about, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably says something about the
likelihood of people wanting to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be low cost and may have been
around for a while, but not only is it
[SPEAKER_00]: farming byproduct, which you may or may
not want to use in your grow at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in most of these cases, we've got new
and better available things to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's a fair assumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I do still like feather meal
and I will use a small amount of feather
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, but the blood meal and bone meal,
I would prefer to use fish products on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a personal choice,
but they're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a good cheap source of
them, by all means, you should utilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live on an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people like to be
self-sufficient and don't want to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: over things packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of people who are into
probiotic are very much into being
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and brewing up their own
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't take long for people to
realize that the rabbits that they keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: their poop is really great for their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start thinking, well,
maybe the straw filled with chicken poop
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chicken yard would be good for my
plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take those individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who want to derive their
nutrients on their own property,
[SPEAKER_00]: how good of a choice is rabbit poop and
chicken poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a general rule, I like to break out
animal manures based on what that animal
[SPEAKER_01]: likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, herbivores tend to be safer
compost or safer manures than carnivore or
[SPEAKER_01]: omnivores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like rabbits and chickens,
those horse, for example, those are all
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tend to be able to use them much more
readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, rabbit poop doesn't need to
be composted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in general, I like to compost all
animal manures because it reduces or
[SPEAKER_01]: removes the risk of pathogens like E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli or salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people have been using rabbit manure
raw directly on their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for generations now without a lot
of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing about chicken manure that
you mentioned is chicken manure can be
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they talk about a source of
manure being hot, not only can that be
[SPEAKER_01]: thermally hot as in temperature wise,
because those bacteria and microorganisms
[SPEAKER_01]: are reproducing so rapidly as they break
down that material, that manure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an exothermic reaction which
generates heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you may already know, plants do not
like a lot of high temperatures around
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting that right into the soil can be
damaging for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, when they talk about burning,
the other thing that can occur is when you
[SPEAKER_01]: put a high nitrogen source out like that,
the bacteria and microorganisms can be
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient at consuming the nitrogen
that is available in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they can do is actually pull
nitrogen from that soil more efficiently
[SPEAKER_01]: than plant, and then the plant can show
nitrogen deficiencies, even though there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of nitrogen in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So running that backwards, it sounds like
the chicken poop would probably be best
[SPEAKER_00]: serve the gardener to rake out the yard
and then compost that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can cool out and be a little more
stable and use it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for rabbits, the rabbit poop,
potentially throw it on there as a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress and then water over it, kind of like
as a time release thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those both sound like reasonable ways
to use those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rabbit poop is a lot easier to
collect too because the rabbits are
[SPEAKER_01]: typically living in cages with mesh or
mesh bottoms so that that drops through.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the chicken poop, what we do is we
put all of our chickens on arborous chips,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is essentially large wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really, really high in carbon,
so which balances out the high nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively speaking of the chicken poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will compost right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a deep litter method for
chicken owners, and that will slowly break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after a period of time,
we'll remove that sort of composted
[SPEAKER_01]: material and let it compost further before
bringing it back in as a fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on the deep litter method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that, Tad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tad, while we've got you here,
we might as well talk about human manure
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do use human feces with their
plants, and that grosses out a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but a lot of the people who use it
swear by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what say you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say it grosses me out a little
bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problems with human manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like to use it on my edible
plants, and I would throw cannabis in that
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say, there's a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this guy on IC Mag a while back
that would post all of his food.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I had a hemp smoothie for
lunch, and then he would show his plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, and it was the saddest looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was so funny, all the comments on
that thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I personally choose not to
use human manure just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher risk of E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and some of these other pathogens
like salmonella in all seriousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fully, fully compost the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're heating it to 131
degrees for at least three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're turning the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a lot more work to really
remove those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave that for the strictly hardcore
experimenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about a lot of the easy
inputs today, and one way or another,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all feeding our NPK and very
possibly also our microbe communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to stick with just
using plant inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything in this list today that
we can't replace with some other plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say there's anything that's
irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to use some animal and fish
products just because it's a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: get these, especially the macronutrients,
the nitrogen and phosphorus specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: in high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are able to pick them up from
plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't like to take it as far as the
veganics guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: An animal will be walking in the woods and
die in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that animal will be consumed by
microorganisms and break back down into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's a perfectly natural
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's an important process that
we need to recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, animal byproducts are not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to look into your sourcing
of them when you're choosing to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this summer is the first year that I
got into this stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided I just wanted to start
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started with insect frass,
worm castings, and a liquid fish product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's an easy way for
people to get into it without thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have to have all of the
knowledge that we went through today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you started with three really
great products too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal would be the other one I would
recommend to people, even though it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't fit into that poop category.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I forgot to mention about
worm castings is if you ever see a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just a little bit unhappy,
throwing a handful or two of worm castings
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and watering it in, a lot of
times it can correct these little mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the minor issues you may
have as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend told me that worm castings is
the chocolate cake of the plant nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with humans, no matter what's
got you down, if you have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate cake, you'll feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he feels about worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would even say it's healthier though
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not putting on anything that's
going to be bad for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to ultimately increase its
health unlike chocolate cake for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
