[SPEAKER_00]: So Larry, the reason I wanted to talk to
you today is because I've become a big fan
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Saints joints packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, absolutely, the joints are
fantastic as well, but being a marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: nerd, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed right away that there are some
interesting things about your packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: that creates more customer loyalty in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you've got certain packs
that I think that are your regular line,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you also have got these co-brand
packs and special release packs that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody starts to look for because
they're special edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't buy them now, they're not
going to be able to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are all these people on
Instagram who are showing off all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: different Saints packages, proud of what
they've collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to sit down with you
and find out a little bit about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: think through that process, because your
approach is different than most
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they finally settle on one package
and they just do that again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're constantly redesigning your
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a really short attention span in
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started out with three packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started with the silver pack,
which is Sativa, a gold pack, Indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a green pack, which was CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just kind of naturally moved
along as we got bored with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three, and then a collaboration pack
happened with Goldie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that turned out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that blossomed into our first
collaboration pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, we did some limited
edition boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did pride boxes for, yeah, we made it
600 the first year and donated proceeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: Equal Rights Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you that people buy those just as a
historical document, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People collect pride things and people are
proud of pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people who might not even have been
familiar with Saints, they are picking
[SPEAKER_00]: those up because you're becoming an ally
with this entire group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's who you identify with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you look for when you are looking
for somebody or an idea that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: co-brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the ideas have come from people
that I've worked with in the past or
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I admire or farms I admire,
or even just nice people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool, too, because that means
that your likelihood of doing a co-brand
[SPEAKER_00]: with somebody who either A, is going to
harass you, goes down, or B, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: co-brand with somebody, your brand is a
little vulnerable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they do something that's jerky,
then that reflects on you for having a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're choosing people that are
friends first, it's probably a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we sell more and more boxes,
that comes up more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because each time you do a new
co-brand, you increase your risk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit that something's going to go south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you've got a background in a
record label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the similarities that you're
finding between how you're managing the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and the branding for Saints that
are similar to things that you did when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were packaging and marketing records?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so similar that I think that's
why it came so easy, because you colored
[SPEAKER_01]: vinyl, different variations, limited
editions, making them all different,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just having fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which comes first, the package or the
cultivar choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started with the packaging,
but now the cultivar choice is the number
[SPEAKER_01]: one, especially in the Washington market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The competition is really high at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so many of the companies feel
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one thing I noticed when we were
just touring your grow rooms is that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling smells that I don't get when I
tour many other grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of unique terpene hits that
I'm like, oh, I haven't smelled that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it lines up really well with your
unique packaging too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I see that your packages are also
psychedelic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're pointing out that this is an
uncommon product in the packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when they open it, they know,
hey, this is uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to make sure that none of our
plants taste or smell the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have around, right now, about 20
varieties, and we're constantly adding to
[SPEAKER_01]: them as we go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many different packages have you
made in total now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say right around 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you still running those original
three still?
[SPEAKER_01]: I constantly change them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at them, you'll see the
small inconsistencies or differences for a
[SPEAKER_01]: true Sanctuary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the record, first pressing,
second pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I noticed when we
were walking through manufacturing is how
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is still very much done by
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time in California now,
and everybody is talking about scaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How everything's getting scaled up,
and you've got to be able to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds for $400.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're all sitting there in the
rooms listening to these people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we're all going, that's going to
taste bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plan for lots of mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the doing the packaging by
hand and doing a hand trim on beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, how does that also express itself
in the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do everything to 100% that we
can do with all the tools we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take the care at every single
step, the customer will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the little scaling, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who follow Shape and Fire know that
I'm a real nerd for no-till and KNF and
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic inputs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came to talk to you today,
I was coming to talk about the packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what initially drew me to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I find out you're no-till as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for folks who came for the packaging
and now are going to stay for the no-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us a little bit about how you are
expressing no-till and compost teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been a long journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I try to eat organic,
smoke organic, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started delving into it,
the plant health went down, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant health came up really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've never seen as many,
the whole building is filled with dark
[SPEAKER_01]: green plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting better and better and
better, just like the soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the little dip you had, because a lot
of people, they're concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear this from growers all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're historically using salt bottled
newts, they're afraid to make the move
[SPEAKER_00]: over to no-till or KNF or probiotic,
because there's a lot on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't have a cycle that goes bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that could be six figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the little dip that you had,
do you think that dip was because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants themselves were going through a
botanical transition, or do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: was more your learning curve in getting
them flipped?
Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went now, nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, we didn't have a whole lot on
the line when we took that dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm glad I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less to lose, which allows you to
experiment more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really hope that you keep up with
this gorgeous packaging and these great
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm stoked to see yet another premier
farming operation going no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best of luck, and thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
