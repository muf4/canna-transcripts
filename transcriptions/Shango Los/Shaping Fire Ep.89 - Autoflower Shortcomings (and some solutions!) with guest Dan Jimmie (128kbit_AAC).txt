[SPEAKER_01]: When we like something, it becomes a part
of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we like something, we tend to defend
it and say it's a good thing because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime we identify with something as us
and start to defend it though,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can lead us down a bad path.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important to stay philosophically
detached from ideas and people so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: keep our minds flexible and willing to say
that we are wrong and adapt.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is Dan Jimmy, more commonly
known in the underground as Full Duplex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is founder and breeder at Gnome
Automatics, formerly known as Mandalorian
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics, an award-winning and
exceptionally well-respected line of auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is also co-founder of AutoFlower.net,
the center of the auto flower breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation universe since 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I are both well-known evangelists
of auto flower plants, but today we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to focus on everything about them
that we find difficult and annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango, thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of funny that we're
doing this particular topic since you and
[SPEAKER_02]: I are both known as evangelists for auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were both, you know,
talking up auto flowers all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are going to do a show where
we're essentially talking trash about auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the aspects of what we
absolutely don't like about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have, like you said,
we're both evangelists for the auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a massive, you know,
wave come across the industry as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of things about
them that just get rather frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've grown over over 150
varieties, like a hundred and fifty eight
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell people they should try them and
I highly recommend them for patients and
[SPEAKER_02]: for people with space constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my gosh, I get frustrated just like
everybody else with some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for joining me today so we
can talk about all the things we hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a great
conversation for people to realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that even though we love them so
much that, you know, like you just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get frustrated, we run into problems
and I think it's good to kind of see both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of that, you know, kind of bring it
both to light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, let's start on this list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we're going to handle the
show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go through all of
these different categories of things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we find frustrating about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's funny is that as Dan and I were
getting ready for the show and we were
[SPEAKER_02]: putting up a list, it was really shocking
that the list was so long, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just just looking at it really quick,
you know, I can I think there's like 15 or
[SPEAKER_02]: so here and it's it's amazing that
something that has got so many downsides
[SPEAKER_02]: or challenges would actually be something
that we like so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so let's let's start right at the top,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since you're the breeder, I will I'll
let you start with our first one here
[SPEAKER_02]: about seed inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about both about
the seeding inconsistency in one pack and
[SPEAKER_02]: also inconsistent seeds from breeder to
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't you go ahead and get us
started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you letting me take off with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inconsistent seeds in one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember coming over to Vimeo events
back before we become so close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had made a comment that like,
you know, one of the things with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers is when you open up a tent pack of
maybe feminized or regular it's literally
[SPEAKER_00]: like opening up a pack of Pokemon cards,
you have no idea what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a frustration point for me
very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's partly why I went down
the rabbit hole so far was because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're getting these seeds in
from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being mass produced in warehouses
because the majority like we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about in the history of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this really started off in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have such big crops being
produced into seed, there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple parents from both sides,
whether they're being reversed and making
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed or they're being,
you know, traditionally bred male female,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more than one pollen donor usually
in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the biggest
things that leads to, and I know it is
[SPEAKER_00]: from experimentation myself, the
inconsistency that we see in a three pack
[SPEAKER_00]: to a tent pack, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's, it's, it's frustrating
for most of us who have spent most of our
[SPEAKER_02]: growing time with photo periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, you might have a line of
something and there might be three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: or five phenos within the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're going to get your eight
or 10 or 12 pack, you may see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, two or three or four or all of
these different phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a well made seed run will,
will have fewer phenos in it so that most
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody who's growing it is getting an
example plant that is closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: intention of the, of the breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my gosh, when you get phenos in,
in auto flower packs, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes you're lucky to see two of the
same pheno in a pack just because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: got so much variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be incredibly frustrating as,
as a grower, especially if you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in small volume, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are growing, you know, just your
five or six legal plants in most states
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and you, and you're, and you really
like a particular variety and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it, hoping to get a few of that
same plant and you either, you either
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get the target pheno that you
wanted, the one that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on Instagram, the one that looks
incredible or like in your case,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This year I grew a lot of your stuff and,
and, you know, most of your popular stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: is purple, but then there's like the
purple on purple, which takes the great
[SPEAKER_02]: photos, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I grew wanting what I saw in your
photographs and, and I was lucky because I
[SPEAKER_02]: got that purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm assuming that, that,
you know, that's because I was running F
[SPEAKER_02]: fours of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so these were, these were seed,
this was a seed line that was worked to a
[SPEAKER_02]: degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was less variety of phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, if, if we find
somebody who's putting out unworked lines
[SPEAKER_02]: of auto flowers, sometimes they're fun to
see all the phenos, but there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, you're just going to get more
variety versus a more mature line that
[SPEAKER_02]: like you tend to put out where your plants
are, are, are more the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's the best way I
could have, you know, described it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I put the work in, you know,
we'll use anvil for example, I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's my most consistent cultivar that I've
ever put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's been inbred to F eight,
the first feminist ization of that line
[SPEAKER_00]: was F seven to F seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was its first reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the offspring of the first
reversal, all the FEM seeds pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: came out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by pretty much, I'm not going to say
it was a completely uniform grow or excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me, uniform expression across every one of
the seeds that were sold, but it was very,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from that consistent
working and developing that narrowing down
[SPEAKER_00]: your phenotype, you know, your phenotypes
to pollinate the pollen receivers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's either a feminization or a
regular, you know, male female pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: run, the idea is matching parents and
those matching parents that math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use that in air quotes has worked
out to me to produce something so stable
[SPEAKER_00]: across any seed that cracks from anvil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's only fair to point out
that, um, you know, even though we used
[SPEAKER_02]: your, you as an example, and I've grown
your seeds and we're friends, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are plenty of breeders out
there that are working their lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is, this is not a
commercial for no automatics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I'm growing your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the point is, is that if you want to
have less variety in your seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you buy from a,
um, from a seed producer who cares about
[SPEAKER_02]: decreasing the phenos, because there are
certainly people who intentionally put out
[SPEAKER_02]: packs that are, you know, great for
hunting, you know, do your own sift,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, these, these, these type of
breeder packs, uh, are great for their
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're a home grower and
you want to grow the plant that's on,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's on the Instagram, that looks like
the picture, um, you're definitely going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want to get something, um, that has
been worked a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just depends on the kinds of,
uh, the, the kind of experience you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are several other
wonderful breeders out here in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the auto flower realm that put the work
in and actually do the testing and produce
[SPEAKER_00]: these generational lines, whether it's
just, consistently feminizing them for
[SPEAKER_00]: each generation or traditional,
you know, selection, male, female,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then feminizing them once they find a
nice, you know, group of seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out and expressing the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several guys out there with that
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing I'd like to touch on
about, you mentioned just slightly about
[SPEAKER_00]: like the home grower with the
inconsistency and, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these states that are legal now,
they have a very tight plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't want to invest a lot of
money into a big setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not going out and buying
your four by four tents and your six and
[SPEAKER_00]: 750 or up to a thousand watt LEDs or HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dealing with a very small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got inconsistencies in the
pack, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those might stay within the height
of, uh, you know, say a two by two by four
[SPEAKER_00]: size tent that they're growing in their
closet, but then there could be a rogue
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino in that pack that literally pushes
the light to the top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to have a bad experience
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going to turn them off to
seeing all of this, like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's too much variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I control this to keep it,
you know, yielding successfully?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I think it's important to point
out too, that because the, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lineage of Ruderalis in our scene,
I mean, while, while it goes back,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, well over a decade, it doesn't,
it, the Ruderalis lines have not been bred
[SPEAKER_02]: nearly as much as, uh, photo periods,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not only are you going to get a lot
of variety within a pack generally,
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking, um, if we look at the entire
pool of seeds, but you're also going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a lot of variety from breeder to
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because, um, with photo periods,
um, a, a newish breeder is generally going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take something that is already popular
or reliable or hype, and they will,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they will, they will make that
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're starting with really
reliable seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have got a lot of breeding history
and a lot of stability in them to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's, it's,
it's like, you know, what do they say that
[SPEAKER_02]: shooting the side of a barn, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like really hard to miss when you
are, when you're breeding things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: already stable in and of themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have been, you know,
uh, breeding them for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas there's a whole bunch of wild
still in these Ruderalis lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, somebody who is a, is a new,
new to breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they very well may not, uh,
have the experience or the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, to get those seeds up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you might, you might
find seeds cheaper or they might be given
[SPEAKER_02]: to you by a friend who's just starting out
at, you know, growing auto flowers or
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, most of the new stuff,
the, the wild isn't, um, bred out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: like it is with, with many of the photo
periods or most of the photo periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we have access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means that, um, novice growers
are really making novice seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with photos, a novice breeder can
make really good seeds on accident right
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see that with the
auto flower community too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of, you know, people out
there who have done the work, who've put
[SPEAKER_00]: in the structure, who have helped build up
this cultivar and saying its praises for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're finally starting to make their
way in to being respected as an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for a long time, I mean,
we, we, and we've talked about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, auto flower was a lot of times a
joke of the, you know, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing some of these newer
breeders coming up and using stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already been built upon all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings me to the point that even
though they're doing that, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: getting inconsistencies because they're
not taking like two seeds from one brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, two cultivars from one brand and
using those for their breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually taking something from,
you know, we'll say a fista for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, and then night owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just using names just as
placeholders here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they throw them together and
they're not getting the result that they
[SPEAKER_00]: look for because of that wild nature of
the ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's breeding style is still very
relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The angle of attack is very different in
structural wise of what people are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people still don't quite
understand them and the mechanics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think all of that comes into the
inconsistency that we're seeing from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders to breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the quality stuff come out from
guys who've been working them
[SPEAKER_00]: generationally and you start to see some
sketch stuff from somebody who's coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're trying to just force it on the
community and take hold of the auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually, it's interesting that you
would mention Mephisto and night owl,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I would say that those two brands
are at the top of people starting with
[SPEAKER_02]: those who are just starting out wanting to
make auto flower seeds because they'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they'll take a couple of
Mephisto's and run them against each other
[SPEAKER_02]: or they'll take a Mephisto and,
you know, pollinate it with something from
[SPEAKER_02]: Daz or, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see these crosses just because
they've got such great reputations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason I wasn't mentioning
your brand Gnome Automatics is because
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly, your stuff is sold out so fast
until just recently, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been making, you know, larger
numbers of packs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're more available to
people who want them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, your, your, your first runs
like sold out so quickly, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yeah, those are already sold out and
like, oh damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but yeah, I think there's,
I've seen so many crosses that are one
[SPEAKER_02]: Mephisto against another Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the person is trying to get their
favorite qualities out of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seems to be a pretty common
place for people to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those, like I said,
those were complete placeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are two, you know,
Mephisto has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz and I have a fantastic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that guy to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's no tack on either
one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an example because like,
you know, then there are people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying to build from the ground
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so you've got like a multitude of
angles of which we do see the
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistency from breeder to breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm trying, I don't want this to
be about a commercial about Gnome
[SPEAKER_00]: Automatics, even though it would be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like, I do,
I have been fortunate now to figure out a
[SPEAKER_00]: few more things with inside my plant
counts to make more seed for people
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've, you know, adjusted my
process and adapted over the last couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years since things started taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it was pretty much I had to,
if I wanted to stay with what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've hit the seed
inconsistency part pretty, pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to say there before
we move on to the next topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that flowed very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, like, you know, we got some depth in
there and give people a good, I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: a little closer than 10,000 foot view on
why they see what they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're all pretty much aware
that when you're germinating a seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you generally want to bring, you know,
do so under a little weaker light than a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a high caliber 800 or 1000 watt
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to give it that kind of
nursery experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that's really odd
about auto flowers is they really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like the intensity of light until they are
a bit older.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have, I have stunted my plants a
variety of times because I, I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I germinated the seed and, and I put it
into the tent with a high intensity BIOS
[SPEAKER_02]: LED light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it did adjust and just didn't
want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost like the bright light was
too harsh for the youthful nature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of it sucking up the light
and, you know, growing swiftly,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually seems to have slowed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I suspect that that has been your
experience too.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen high intensity, autists have a
love-hate relationship with light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity and duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the early stages, as you were
mentioning, like they want a weaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: less intense light to allow them to come
up, put their first set of leaves up and
[SPEAKER_00]: start kind of moving along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people may jump the gun if
they're running new age LED and dial it up
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more, or bring it a little
bit closer to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I always suggest is like,
let the plant to avoid this stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very frustrating because I actually
just did it this past run again,
[SPEAKER_00]: like two to two in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning some, you know, I'm playing
with things, but like, let that plant grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to the light because when it first comes
out and it starts germinating,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it needs more light, it's going to tell
you it needs more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to do what I call the ninth
inning stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give itself that first set
of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that main stem is just going to
get longer and longer and longer and
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice that elongation,
then you can dial up that light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: by, you know, small increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't inevitably stunt that plant
from trying to push, push, push.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the double edge sort of that is once
they get to that more mature state,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to help, which is going to be
our next topic, yield, you need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that intensity and light hour time is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the reasons why I put in the
extra effort to buy a light that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: has got an integrated dimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that dimmers have evolved for grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, when I'm, when I'm
starting my auto flowers out, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to do it the wrong way first,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I ruined two rounds of seeds before I
realized that my full power bio slight was
[SPEAKER_02]: just like kicking these, these,
these seedlings asses that they just
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I turned down the dimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, you know, to about half power
and that that helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so I turned it up once the,
the, the, the gosh, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_02]: botany botanical name, but the,
the, the young leaves, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they, when they grow up tall enough,
they're low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they, they kind of like shrivel
up and go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we, we, we tend to talk about
them at that point as being like
[SPEAKER_02]: teenagers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I turn it up to full blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because if I turn it up too fast on
these small plants, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, we're just going to stay here at
three inches forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the big things that I've
noticed too, is like, if you turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing up too quick, your internal spacing
becomes so stacked that like it's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: all that energy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll impact your side shoot growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any kind of side branching that could
have been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be impacted because like the
nodes sit so closely and you have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to maintain that balance between
giving it enough to get it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that, that preteen or teenager
stage when, okay, the plant sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're starting like under a jeweler's
loop, you can start to see the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sex organs come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could touch on the botanical
terms of that too, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, like when you see it,
start to see that underneath a jeweler's
[SPEAKER_00]: loop and that's when you can start to
bring up that intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you bring it up too soon,
like you said, that plant's going to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: like three, maybe four inches tall and
pretty much be pissed off at you its
[SPEAKER_00]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, you know, think that you
failed, but we're here trying to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that like this frustration hurts us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done it and I still do it to
this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, even with all this,
all these complaints we've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still both in love with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's really just about finding,
you know, getting into relationship with
[SPEAKER_02]: this new plant that has got different
characteristics than we're used to with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so our next topic is, is probably
the number one thing that people complain
[SPEAKER_02]: about when it comes to autoflower and
that's yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, you know, before,
before pandemic, when I was traveling to
[SPEAKER_02]: conventions and you know, teaching about
autoflowers and kind of banging the
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower drum, the, you know,
the number one, you know, question I got
[SPEAKER_02]: from people was, you know, yeah,
but can they grow big because we love
[SPEAKER_02]: growing these monster plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I love growing monster plants
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole monster plant thing though,
really did take off with California's 99
[SPEAKER_02]: medical plant count, where suddenly every
single plant had to be a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really strengthened that large
plant culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and they're beautiful and I'm in no
way dissing on large plants, but really
[SPEAKER_02]: large plants are not really the end all
when it comes to choosing a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are a lot of reasons why the
size per plant, you may actually want it
[SPEAKER_02]: to be smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say for example, you are doing it in a
tent or you're doing it in a small closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a shoebox grow, or if you need to
keep your plants short so that your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors can't see them over the fence,
or if you are a patient with poor
[SPEAKER_02]: mobility, they're like, how the heck are
you going to harvest a 10, 12 foot plant
[SPEAKER_02]: when you know, your arthritis is so bad,
you can barely lift your arms above your
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so, so I guess, I guess clearly I
went right into defensive nature about the
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the problem is, is that the
plants are small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you, you may only pull an
ounce off of a plant, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're used to pulling pounds,
pulling off an ounce is going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to feel very lackluster to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll feel very unsatisfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I agree with you,
big, beautiful trees, like monster plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll get on that train.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown quite a few big ones myself and
it's fun to watch, but it is, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: said, it's a ton of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people that you and I deal
with are medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to, you know, ooze that energy out
when I'm, you know, talking to other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and I'm talking to other people
or behind the scenes and DMs that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, patient minded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard for somebody to climb
up a ladder or hang trellis or trim all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm fortunately still physically
very capable, but like when I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, it's got six gigantic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me weeks to harvest that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can see the deterrent of
with auto flowers being smaller and the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields being less than that because that's
what we have seen for so long now that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could turn people off to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time in the mind,
you're still getting an ounce at a minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of your auto flowers these days
of your own homegrown flower that you
[SPEAKER_00]: started from the seed, you germinated and
you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, more, not
traditional, but more modern era auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers are, you know, you can have a few
mistakes with them and still get more than
[SPEAKER_00]: an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could see more yield and
discrepancy, especially from the big farm
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to like a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a home grower is not going to
have the opportunity to grow seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, 10 foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's going to be pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, even though we're talking
about yield and how it relates to size,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my experience, the yield per inch of
the plant is actually quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you might get a small
plant, but the amount of flowers you get
[SPEAKER_02]: off that small plant is going to be on par
with a photo period plant of that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has that been your experience as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I've noticed with auto
flowers that bud structures indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me caveat that first, indoor a lot
tighter, because a majority of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just really starting to grow auto flowers
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the, you know, the intense light
hours, you know, it's 18 or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend don't go in like
anything lower than 16, or you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: impact your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have conversations on the
regular in different forums about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if we just 12, 12?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it's going to impact the
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though this plant may be a foot
tall or something like that, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is basically the entire plant,
like the entire plant puts off flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: every direction, especially with side
branching and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor, my experience has been better
structured, better yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that also the auto flowers tend to
grow their individual flowers together
[SPEAKER_02]: into what many people will describe as
either like a baseball bat stock or a or
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, cola, the size of your arm,
you know, people will talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very common for a, you know,
a petite auto flower plant that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be under three feet to be also be stocky,
you know, it's, it's fat, it's got a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: primary cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so your, your weight for space is
exactly where you would want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we, when we talk, you know,
and complain about yield, we're really not
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how much flower per inch,
we're really only talking about the size
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you, if you have got
the, you know, if you're in the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: situation, you know, so instead of growing
one big plant, grow three auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're going to get the same yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you're growing three plants
instead of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are ways around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're, if you've got strict
plant counts, and that is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you are concerned with, well, then that's
not the best solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people I know who are growing
for themselves and growing auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just growing them on their deck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not there are five plants
on their deck or 10 plants on their deck,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really matter to a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't, you know, and I mean,
I see that up a lot up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also agree with you too,
like it's, it's, it comes back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you got three of them in that
tent, and you've given them an indoor 16
[SPEAKER_00]: to 18 hours light or more during the day,
a lot of people run 24 hours across those
[SPEAKER_00]: three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grew, you're going to get a great
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you compare to growing one large plant
inside that single space area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's kind of going to
balance its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure, you got a little bit more
plant care to take care of rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: just focusing your energy on one plant,
but I think it's kind of a wash between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so now that we've kind of established
that, yeah, the plants are smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the yield for the smaller plant is on
par with a photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's finish off this set by talking about
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh boy, there's so much, there's so
much to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't, why don't you get us started on
this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I'll come right out and say it
like I, there's, it's very hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene profiles that people would
consider hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: People consider hype two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be either like some kind of
cookies, or it could be some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: unique specific terpene profile,
whichever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like with Ritter Alice, this is one of
those nasty things that we're still trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to fight out is the fact that we got a lot
of earth, we get a lot of spice,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a lot of pining, there's a lot of
like incense, like Nag Champa smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, like traditional early on terpenes
before we really started, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: advancing the way photo periods are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about earlier that like the
photo period breeding game has been going
[SPEAKER_00]: on way longer than when the autoflower,
the autoflower scene has really come
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working diligently on trying to
improve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have expanded my realm into photo
periods that are, that have been grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: selected into this area to try to source
in some of those new terpene profiles so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can get the sweeter candy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can get the stuff that appeal,
or the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I gave you a tester this summer
called Methane, and I finally found two
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers that actually had a traditional
fuel smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say like, you know,
straight up gasoline, but there was a fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: like diesel-y, like petrol smell to these
plants, and it was shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpenes, they do need a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be the first to admit,
like I, there's some of the plants that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have that they don't smell that great,
but the smoke is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's trying to bridge all those gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some serious work I believe
that needs to be done, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating because it's, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially on that gas smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gas, fuel, you know, it's very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very popular right now, but also it's
my favorite, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I still go for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have yet to find, actually
that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say I have yet to find a
terpene I don't like, but that's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a big fan of the burnt
rubber aspect that comes out in some skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was startling the first time I tasted
burnt rubber out of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought that I had done something
drastically wrong with this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I looked it up and I'm like,
oh, this is actually a profile that's
[SPEAKER_02]: common.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, other than that, the gas ones
are still pretty rare in auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: so rare that, you know, after my 150 some
varieties, I've really only found it in
[SPEAKER_02]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I must say that I haven't grown your
methane yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your methane is actually one of them that
I stunted with too bright of lights
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to take another approach with
the methane with my dimmer now installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Humboldt Seed Company sour apple
that just came out this year, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: kind enough to send some seeds my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one has got an authentic gas in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually paired with a green
apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually makes for a pretty
interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kind of green Granny Smith apple with
a fuel taste to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you are If you're going
to auto flowers to replicate the same
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles that you're getting on your photo
period plants, the lines are just not
[SPEAKER_02]: mature enough that you are going to be
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you approach auto flowers,
it really will serve you to find out what
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flowers have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do auto flowers like to express
themselves and then be happy with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that everything in auto
flowers is watered down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are definitely some terpene
profiles that are more successful in auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've already said, fuel is pretty
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if if you like like the the the,
you know, grape Jolly Rancher kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetness of candy smells, oh my gosh,
you're gonna you're gonna love the candy
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities in auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also good bubble gum in auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, there is great, you know,
pining earthy incense kind of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already hit on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I first started experimenting
with auto flowers, I wanted my auto flower
[SPEAKER_02]: to taste like the similar parent in photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not really how it works out
because not only are you adding this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ruderalis genetics with
which, you know, naturally pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: just tastes like grass or hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not a wonderfully taste
tasting plant on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is the relationship with the
terpenes that the breeder brings into the
[SPEAKER_02]: storyline and then has to refine over
generations to get them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean it is it's a lesser
plant than going only photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just means that the breeding history
of it is so young.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they've got a while to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of really great
tasting auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like like every summer,
I'll grow my my photo periods and my
[SPEAKER_02]: autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually the autos that,
you know, have got better terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're more mature lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing where I live in the
Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those photo period plants can
really finish outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty rare for for those
plants to to get all of their,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eight to nine and a half weeks
to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, you know,
if we're going to grow it outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: are we more interested in in growing photo
periods that are not going to fully mature
[SPEAKER_02]: and finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do I want to grow an auto flower that
will totally mature and finish and do so
[SPEAKER_02]: conveniently in the beginning of September
instead of waiting for October not
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing and dealing with mold of the
photo periods?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's that's a pretty
complex answer that most people who just
[SPEAKER_02]: say, you know, auto flowers suck compared
to photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, you know, there's a lot
of truth to what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but like, where do you live?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your needs?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your health?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your growing situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to weigh all these
different attributes before disposing of
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just finished a great purple lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's it's one of the best
smelling, most delightful to smoke plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that that I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just wails on so many of the
mediocre photo periods that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was still only three
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think I think you hit the
nail on the head right there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the with the growth season
that we have and the location that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at, I struggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've struggled for three, four years
outdoor now to finish some of these photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods that they look great, they smell
great, but there's just not enough time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've grown like wedding cake and
I've grown runs all this from cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry, cherry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, the benefit of being
shared with of all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful smelling photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is they don't get to fully
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get to enjoy that full
maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to fully mature profile of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with my autos, I've already got
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried and in jars while I'm still
struggling to fight the rains and the
[SPEAKER_00]: molds in the mildews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just described my life, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so satisfying to have the auto
flowers harvested, dried and in jars
[SPEAKER_02]: curing and already like sneaking buds out
to smoke while the photo periods are still
[SPEAKER_02]: outside in the greenhouse dealing with a
sub 50 degree nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wondering if they're ever going to finish
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once, you know, once we break below 55
degrees, you know, photosynthesis really
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not only adding in the combating
of the mold, the mildew you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're dealing with a long
running strain to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs eight, nine, 10 weeks maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you deal down with the actual
slowing of the metabolism of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've, you've compounded issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, autos are done,
you know, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're trying to figure out how to
finish out your photo period crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got something else I want to suggest
with the terpene profiles of autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't say I know this to be true,
but I, but I have seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstantial evidence on my side and I
would be curious or I would, I would
[SPEAKER_02]: hasten to say that auto flowers may have a
difficult time holding the same smell that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have while they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that just about all the auto
flowers I have grown, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, we all expect the, the flavors of the
terpenes to evolve in cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with most auto flowers, what I end up
taking out of the jar smells very little
[SPEAKER_02]: like the plant did when it was alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be startling.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, you know, I expected you to
ask me if there was going to be one more
[SPEAKER_00]: thing before we moved on to another
subject or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you literally stole the thought from
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen a lot of what I call loss of
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be, it'll grow great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a nice chemically smell or I'll
get a nice, a very pronounced,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like cotton candy smell, you know,
or even a very pronounced fuel smell and
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, Oh man, here it is finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do the slow dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do a 60, 60 dry cure
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a dry environment where it's 60 degrees
and 60% RH and try to let those things go
[SPEAKER_00]: as low and slow as possible to maintain
these terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it is the fact that
the plant can't translate it well enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if they're still so volatile in the
genetics and the early of the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: that they just, they're gone by the time
they go through the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this, could this open up another way
that we dry our autos slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the practice is we've been using our
photo periods in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I have noticed that loss
in translation myself multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, I'm so excited about what
it's outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got three or four females that
are in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like finally, I've got a, a multiple that
are bringing this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one out of the six may hold on to
a 10th of that smell that I smelled on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I share that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for me, that's one of the reasons
why I don't hold on to auto flowers as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as I would my photo periods,
I will either, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as soon as they're ready to go,
I will start to smoking them right away,
[SPEAKER_02]: start giving them to friends, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what I, what I generally do with most
of my autos is make hash because that that
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to stabilize it pretty effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know what's going into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's, you know,
a volatile mono terpenes that we're losing
[SPEAKER_02]: right away, or maybe there's something
going on with the, you know, the sugars in
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants that it actually cures
differently than a photo period does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we have, I don't think
there's any science on any of this yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: which just, again, speaks to the fact that
even though auto flowers have been around,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 15, 20 years, that, that with
the modern auto flowers, we're still just
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we're still getting to
know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's still a learning avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot more that,
you know, comes across with the route with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ruderalis genetics than what we think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to, you have anything else to
say about terpene profiles before we,
[SPEAKER_02]: before we wrap up this set?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely grabbed that last thought
right out of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and take a
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Hembra Genetics Collection to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Hembra, spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hembra is not just another seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hembra is a woman operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 50 breeders and over 500 strains
to choose from, you will certainly find
[SPEAKER_02]: something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hembra Genetics has something for everyone
with over 350 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 regular varieties, and over 100 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names you know you can trust like Humboldt
Seed Company, Night Owl, Canorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: In-House Genetics, FastBuds, and Gnome
Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both know that there are other seed
banks who will take you money but have no
[SPEAKER_02]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited Hembra to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll usually receive your seeds in
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to you this fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Hembra cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helene and Caitlin get it.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's Hembra Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: by using the discount code ShapingFire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_02]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_02]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_02]: customers is essential, and that is what
we offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_02]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_02]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_02]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_02]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_02]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_02]: and entrepreneurs who are always curious
to learn.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is cannabis breeder, Dan Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we hit the first big
challenges that we find with autoflowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: seed inconsistency, light intensity,
yield, and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna start off second set with
probably the most disappointing and argued
[SPEAKER_02]: about aspect of autoflowers, which is
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll go ahead and get this one
started for us, Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So autoflowers are very sensitive to
shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not like to have their roots
messed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike other plants where we can,
you know, a photo period specifically,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can, you know, pop them up as we
go from, you know, the germination tray
[SPEAKER_02]: into a one gallon or a, you know,
a party cup or something, and then up to a
[SPEAKER_02]: five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're gonna continue up,
you know, you can do that quite easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some folks will even say that it helps
the roots to mess with the bottoms of them
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: While that is a debatable thing,
you know, some people encourage people to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually touch the roots, which is just
not something that would be recommended
[SPEAKER_02]: with an autoflower because when you touch
the roots of autoflowers, it absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: causes them shock and retards their
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you might change a plant
that would have been a three foot plant
[SPEAKER_02]: into not getting any more than,
you know, 10 inches because their life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle is so short.
[SPEAKER_02]: That amount of shock to the root system
will never really allow them to fully
[SPEAKER_02]: recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast enough in time for them to really
express themselves through the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do you tell people about trans-
transplanting, Jim, Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically recommend not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it, does transplanting encourage and
promote rapid root growth into the new
[SPEAKER_00]: medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, with the mechanics of the
autoflower, like grow that thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen, you know, people who can
successfully transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a good job at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't mess with the roots much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my primary recommendation is don't
transplant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, start it off in a two,
a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloth pots work the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to help develop the root system
in a manner to where the plant feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: better, more frequently, and it'll fill
those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of controversy on
it, and I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the, and that goes either if
you're organic or you're in fertigation or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using salts, like any of the
methods, like the only time that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can safely transplant and not
really do massive stress translating to
[SPEAKER_00]: the early triggering of flower on an
autoflower is deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start it in a smaller basket until the
taproot drops below the, or in a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket until the taproot drops into the
water and then put it into the final
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because typically those people are
starting them in rock wool, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rock wool or rapid rooters, and it's
surrounded by all the hydrotron and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really not shocking it because
those roots haven't really had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the opportunity to touch
them like you do say in cocoa or soil or a
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the safest transplant method I
have ever seen with autos is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be deep water culture,
but I'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, if you do shock that root
system there, it translates to lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the end result plant, it's not going
to be able to be as vigorous as it was if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in there gorilla handing that root
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't break up the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sit there and try to, you know,
make the roots a little bit looser because
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are you're going to cause unwanted
and unneeded stress to that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only solution that I have found
for, I will use the term transplanting
[SPEAKER_02]: loosely, but a solution to not germinate
in the pot that I'm going to leave the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in is actually by using some sort of
vessel to germinate the seed in and then
[SPEAKER_02]: move that vessel to the final pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll give you a couple examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, anybody who's been
listening to my show for any amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: time knows that I'm not a fan of using
peat moss because it is a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: unrenewable resource when we pull it out
of the peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, I do still have those little
peat moss expanding discs that they look
[SPEAKER_02]: like a half dollar, like a silver dollar
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you get them wet,
you know, they grow up to be like an inch
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, back before I kind of
turned away from peat, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought like a 200 pack of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they still have them floating around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use them to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I found is I found success
with using one of those peat discs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the water, I use compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got, you know, some living
nutrition that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will germinate my seed in that
peat disc that it's now expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time the first pair of Codledon
leaves have shown themselves on the
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling, that is just about how long it
takes for the taproot to reach the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: of that little plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be moving it over to its
final pot at that moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while you are technically,
you know, repotting it or transplanting
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you're never actually touching the
root zone at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really just taking one pot and then
putting that pot into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have found that to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when these peat discs are all used up,
the new strategy that I'll be using is
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a lot of these small hemp
starter containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of look like the bottom of an
egg crate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'll do going into the future is
I will put soil into one of these like
[SPEAKER_02]: little hemp cups, if you will,
and start the seed in that and use the
[SPEAKER_02]: same timing and let the plant grow through
the fine hemp bottom on that cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get the advantages that you
want from transplanting, meaning that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can start a whole bunch of seeds together
in a tray without having to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have that many full-size pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can select the plants that
you want to have continue on in their life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is one hack that I have found to
kind of get around the inconvenience of
[SPEAKER_02]: not being able to transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What solutions have you found to work
around this, Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, what I like to do is double
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel the need to transplant or if I'm
looking for, you know, transplant shock
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance is use two solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut the bottom out of one solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You place that cup inside of a solo cup
that has its bottom still intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill that with your starting mix or your
organic soil or your cocoa, whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium may be, and then germinate that
seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can allow it to grow a little
further than what you do as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, before, like the first true set
can really come out, maybe even starting
[SPEAKER_00]: into seeing the second set starting to
develop in the center of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you can do is literally
remove the outer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an exposed root ball already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pull the plant from a
cup and you can set that cup right down
[SPEAKER_00]: into your next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I see it as called a tiered
method because, you know, you have this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, slight raised root ball above
your main pot, but it's also caused a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less transplant shock in it that I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's been the easiest way to move or
it's been the easiest vessel to allow a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more growth and move that plant
to another pot without the massive
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sleeve idea is a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, the time that it will take for
the root to go down alongside the inside
[SPEAKER_02]: of that first solo cup gives you a lot
more time to play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas these small plugs that I'm
thinking about, you know, you really only
[SPEAKER_02]: have a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to be on your game and you
need to be paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, the, the, the height of
a solo cup is, is what, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least three times the height.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gives you a lot more time to,
to, you know, respond and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially like if, if you're not a full
time like grower and, and you've got to go
[SPEAKER_02]: like go to work and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, with the, with the smaller
plugs, when it's time to move them to the
[SPEAKER_02]: big pots, like they're not going to wait
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I can imagine with, with your
tiered sleeve method, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got a lot more days to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so the way I'm picturing it,
Dan, your final pot will actually have the
[SPEAKER_02]: white ring of the plastic party cup,
like, like on the surface of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that, is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what the nice thing about this is
it allows you to give that taproot a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger vertical drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that bigger vertical drop,
you've got the soil that's already around
[SPEAKER_00]: where the main plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to have to be watered
through your watering methods too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you leave it a good, you know,
two and a half, three inches above the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil enough to where the, the bottom cup,
or excuse me, the bottom container can
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the cup stable and then have that
elevated room, you're giving yourself that
[SPEAKER_00]: drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I usually don't go all the
way down in because like in my brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: those roots then have to come down out of
that cup and then you're losing that top
[SPEAKER_00]: like potential three to four inches of
soil in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of want to find the happy
medium between the two so where it can
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of your entire,
the entire soil volume in the destination
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dan, I can imagine that there's
some people listening who would,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who there were more visual
learners who would really like to see
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you happen to have a photograph of your
tiered method on your personal Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: that people could go hunt up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might, and it may be way back,
but what I can do is I do know where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: go harvest the pictures because it was a
method that I was using for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time on the Audit Flower Network to help
people avoid transplant shock and to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger plants six, seven, eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was, there's pictures of it
all on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's gentlemen that's still on
the Instagram today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still see them running this method that
have, you know, trickled over from AFN to
[SPEAKER_00]: move, you know, into the social media
platform, Instagram, but I definitely can
[SPEAKER_00]: find some pictures for it and get it on
there, like to update that in content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're, if you're interested in
seeing a picture of it, Dan will have that
[SPEAKER_02]: on his personal Instagram by the time this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a full duplex, full duplex
underscore AFN.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's pretty much the deal with
transplanting and you know, once you are
[SPEAKER_02]: established in autoflowers and,
and you want to start developing methods
[SPEAKER_02]: that you think might work for
transplanting, I fully support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we would, like Dan and I continue
saying we are still in the early,
[SPEAKER_02]: the very early days of autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so developing new techniques are
great, but from, from Dan and I's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: vast experience with autoflowers,
we have not seen success in successful
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to touch the roots and, and startle
the plant and then, and then still have
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant going, you know, turning out
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so we definitely don't recommend it
to anybody who's new to autoflowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Hey, you know, I've got an open mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Dan does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, if you actually develop
technique for transplanting by all means
[SPEAKER_02]: publish that up and share it with all of
us, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, like I said, I am not
against the transplant idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why folks do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to autoflowers,
would I suggest it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't, you know, get to know the
mechanics of the plant and understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: it could potentially do to your future
yield and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if by all means, I mean, if there's
something that you have found out,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, may it be cultivar specific or looking
over the plant and understanding that this
[SPEAKER_00]: method has worked for you every single
time, I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which brings us to the topic of stunting
and, um, you know, there are so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things that you can do to your plant that
would end up causing it to be stunted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, some of the varieties of
autoflowers I have worked with,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like, if you look at it wrong,
it's going to stunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a real pain in the ass
because, you know, photo periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: they really do seem to be, you know,
quite resilient right out of the gates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but autoflowers really do feel like
they are looking for an excuse to stunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I guess for people who are
unfamiliar with this idea of stunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that's where the plant will,
will reach a point at maybe, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, somewhere between two and eight
inches and it will just stall and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it'll, it'll continue maturing,
but it's not putting on any more weight,
[SPEAKER_02]: no more leaf mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will eventually, um, flower too,
but you know, you'll get one nug on it
[SPEAKER_02]: that is mature and it's, it's really a
drag, especially when you're buying seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, most of, most of the quality
autoflower seeds are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: $15 or $18 per seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be damn sure that you're
not doing anything that, um, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: causing a stun stunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, Dan, why don't you run down a
quick list of some of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've seen cause stunting on a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first of all, we'll talk about,
I mean, real quick transplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, transplanting will definitely
cause, um, stunting, highlight power,
[SPEAKER_00]: high, too far, too much intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's bouncing back to an earlier
subject, but the light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, will cause that over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you overwater it, if you're too
excited about growing it, take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that, you know, this is a
seedling and it doesn't require as much
[SPEAKER_00]: water as you think it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these roots run into dry patches or the
bottom of your pots dry, the sidewalls are
[SPEAKER_00]: dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only got a core center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maintained moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll cause them to stun as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures, uh, cold temperatures can
cause them to the stunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really seen an issue with high
temp causing the stunt, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: grouping right there would, would be the
biggest set of triggers that I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly that cause stunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your temperature is a good one to
point out too, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all always so excited to get
outdoors during the summer to get our
[SPEAKER_02]: photo series, our photo period seeds
popped and outside so that we can grow the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest plants possible for the summer
that we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, since auto flowers are,
are only going to, you know, have a life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle that's, you know, 80 to,
well, let's say 65 to a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you really don't have to rush going
outside with my photo periods where I
[SPEAKER_02]: live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm often really tempted to take them
outside in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but in May you can still easily get
nights that are sub 50 degrees and a photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period will handle that no sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially if you take a moment to
harden them off, but that is not true of
[SPEAKER_02]: an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put an auto flower out in May where
I live and we get a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of those cold nights without a
really warm day after it, um, that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant will, will be startled and it
will never recover from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and I have done this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this a few years back to 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, of, of the 30 seeds that I had
outside, only two of them continued on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up having to, you know,
start all over again, um, with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with new seeds and that's an expensive
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, and it can be an expensive error,
especially if you're buying it,
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing fams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you talked about the, about the
price of seeds recently, um, or just a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, it's going to be
frustrating you out there and some simple
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake like that of not being cautionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cost you to restart everything
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reboot the entire run that you're planning
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just try to be, I always suggest people
are like, take a look at your hardiness
[SPEAKER_00]: zones, read an almanac, take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of your extension offices in
the area are going to give you ground
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and nighttime temperatures
and just kind of watch that and do your
[SPEAKER_00]: planning for your, you know, your outdoor
crop based upon those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my grandfather taught me that eons
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we always had a farm
farmer's almanac.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always had a moon phase calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they always check the
university's extension offices for ground
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, air temperatures and
everything before planting his garden
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should take the same care in
this to avoid that typical environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stressor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the general rule of thumb I suggest
to people who are new to autoflowers is to
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate on June 1st because,
you know, for the contiguous US states,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, there's pretty much nowhere that
is not going to be safe by June 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you start a plant June 1st,
and let's, let's, let's say on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the low side, let's say you've got a 65
day plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow all of June, all of July,
and you are harvesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the US has got drought then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be fantastic for not
causing mold in your flowers, but like
[SPEAKER_02]: even a hundred day plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I talk a lot about the lion claw
cultivar on this show that I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a hundred days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, instead of the middle of
August, it's going to be the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: September for that, but that's still
drought season where I live and it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's going to be the best warmth
of the year where I am for, for finishing
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant in heat, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so feel free to just, you know,
you can, by all means, you should be aware
[SPEAKER_02]: of your almanac just to be more connected
with the world around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're fun to look at, but also if,
if you are a patient or if you're a home
[SPEAKER_02]: grower who just like just wants to get the
cannabis and you don't necessarily going
[SPEAKER_02]: to make this like a full time mental hobby
for yourself, feel free to just germinate
[SPEAKER_02]: on June 1st, because I can't think of
anywhere and the continental US that would
[SPEAKER_02]: have a, have a hard time with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I want to point out before
we move on from stunting is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get into relationships with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, growing things can be emotional.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us take a lot of pride and ego
out of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not beat up on yourself if you get a
plant and it stunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not a bad person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not have even done anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants, some autoflowers,
even when you treat them perfectly,
[SPEAKER_02]: they still stunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to do with the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inconsistency that we started the show
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants just stunt and it's a drag,
but like take it easy on yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is, this is part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also, you know, adds some risk when
you're deciding to spend $18 on a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because, you know, out of,
out of, you know, I would say there will
[SPEAKER_02]: be something that's going to stunt out of
most packs from, from that, that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: buy for autoflowers, which is one of the
reasons why, you know, going with more
[SPEAKER_02]: established breeders or people who have
gotten more worked lines will be to your
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if your money is tight and every seed
needs to be a home run.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I also really like growing new
seeds from new breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know, I know that there's going to be
some additional stunted plants in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and you just need to plan for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so if you get a plant that's stunted,
you know, figure out what you may have
[SPEAKER_02]: done wrong and use it as a learning
experience, but don't throw yourself under
[SPEAKER_02]: the bus about it because it happens to all
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you bring up something else too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did forget to touch on something that's
new to me and we've had a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and I've seen it personally is if
you have a cover crop in your pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are an organic grower and you're
running a cover crop and say, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in like a traditional bed,
you're growing in like 10, maybe 15 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot indoor and you have a very established
root robust cover crop, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially drown out the roots
development for the auto causing that
[SPEAKER_00]: stunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas that root root, that root,
that tap root can't develop properly
[SPEAKER_00]: because the cover crop has just consumed
the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not too proud to say that's
me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that's, that's what happened when I
grew your methane's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I had a light that was too intense
and then I didn't realize until after the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that my pot was totally root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with the plant, but with the,
with my green mulch, my cover crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love using Dichondra Rapens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Dichondra Rapens had been in
that pot since it was, it was outdoor this
[SPEAKER_02]: summer and the Rapens had totally taken
over the pot and when I, when it was
[SPEAKER_02]: stunted and I took the soil out of the pot
to see what was going on, the thing was
[SPEAKER_02]: like wall to wall roots of the cover crop
and the plant never had a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I wasn't just, you know,
we had had that conversation because I
[SPEAKER_00]: also had that experience two seasons ago
in my hugelkultur bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that I had successfully
transplanted into my hugelkultur bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a very dense cover crop of two
to three different species of clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that I direct germinated into the
hugelkultur bed, they didn't thrive at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was across multiple varieties and
not just stuff from myself, but from
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow breeders and friends and you know,
seeds that I have traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything that got transplanted
into that bed that already had a more
[SPEAKER_00]: robust root ball survived that stunning
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, I mean, both of us, it was the
thing that we both kind of had an aha
[SPEAKER_00]: moment about, you know, and learning a
whole new method of what could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: cause an auto flower to stunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next topic we're going to talk
about is topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you and I have had
different experiences around this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, whereas I do not top my auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely top my photo periods when
they're in outdoors, but with auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, I don't top them because I see
their life cycle to be too short for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: mess with like startling them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I have topped them, I don't see
them always develop larger colas on the
[SPEAKER_02]: next set of branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I do with photo periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so since I don't see that work
reliably, I just don't top them at all
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't want to cause them stress
in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk either.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my personal, my personal preference is
to let that plant go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics will speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your side branch, especially if you're
growing outside, you're having more
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting light all the way around
the plant rather than just directly down
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen the need to top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do know that there are a lot of guys
out there that are very successful at
[SPEAKER_00]: topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen several plants produce colas
that are just as big as what a main cola
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been on, you know, the
secondary and third branches, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting from the hormone shift of the
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you have to know the cultivar
as far as like, is it known to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle the topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that's when it comes back to
doing the research and seeing what people
[SPEAKER_00]: have done and successfully done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And repeated successfully rather than just
taking that photo period mentality to the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower and just saying, okay,
we're two nodes deep, three nodes deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and top this thing,
give myself, you know, six side branchings
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight side branches or however many you
want, depending on where you top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think that it's a
frustrating point because I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are, have grown photo periods
and want to get into autos and they find
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a major deterrent because if they
top it and it's not one that's known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take top, they have your
experience where it's just like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: little popcorn all the way around this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would go so far as to say that the,
the, the number of varieties that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: top safely and auto flowers is very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I wouldn't say that, oh, you know,
some do, some don't, you need to do your
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that it is rare to find a
plant that can be topped effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that they exist because I see
them on Instagram and friends of mine have
[SPEAKER_02]: done it and I'm all like, I'll be damn
like, well actually in my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, you got lucky, but,
but like, but like, I also have to be open
[SPEAKER_02]: to the possibility that these are also
very skilled growers, likely better than
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have got a soft touch and the
right variety and, and, and it turned out
[SPEAKER_02]: really well for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I guess this is kind of like the
transplanting things where, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, sometimes you can get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you don't have seed to lose
seeds to lose, or if you're new,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, highly don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why it's in like the
dislike category for auto flowers is that
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I like to top everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's a good strategy overall
to control size and to create more colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fact that we can't top auto
flowers, um, you know, at least yet is
[SPEAKER_02]: annoying to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not surprise me though,
that over the years as auto flowers get
[SPEAKER_02]: more, um, depth of, of breeding and the
genetics get stronger towards what we want
[SPEAKER_02]: them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, it wouldn't surprise me if that evolves
out of the genetics in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you said, soft touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think what it is of the guys that
have been growing them as long as I have
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a few new growers out
there who have adapted quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a different skillset,
but like, you know, I really think it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes back to a soft touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to the auto flower game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it ride, you know, don't go,
you know, don't stress yourself out by
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how to do all these
new things while trying to grow a new
[SPEAKER_00]: variety at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And topping is one of those things I would
definitely say, don't do it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand it, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But inevitably it's one thing that I
personally, again, don't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it in my don't do not do list as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next topic we're going to talk
about is a similar, uh, which is training
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, and I, and I'm pretty much a
training novice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I actually am only really learning how
to train now as I am developing my
[SPEAKER_02]: scrogging skills indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because, you know, pretty much my
entire life, I've just grown outdoors
[SPEAKER_02]: because I really do prefer growing under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with where I live now, um,
I, I, you know, I decided I better learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing indoors if I'm going to be
able to provide my own medicine reliably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I'm a big fan of being,
um, a self-sufficient cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so Dan, I'm just going to hand you the
mic and I'm going to say, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, why don't you address the training?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that you've done quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the training thing, I think it's soft
touch thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's frustrating too, cause it can
lead back to stunning, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this, this whole set is kind of like
kind of turns back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that touch of like being able to
manipulate the plant in a manner that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can increase your yields, but at the same
time having that gentle touch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: training and like manifolding,
um, cause I don't like the word main
[SPEAKER_00]: lining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, manifolding and LST and you know,
both of those come back to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: topping the plant to get those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do feel the need of training,
I think LST is going to be your safest
[SPEAKER_00]: bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after it's grown up and you've
actually seen sex or just previous to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing sex on these plants, you know,
kind of tie down that main head rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than lopping it off, tie down that main
head over to the left gently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't break your main stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what that will do is it allows
that light exposure to come down and
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those under smaller branches will
come up and start to chase that main top
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have pulled over to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, just like any kind of LST or
slight train, you know, low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training, um, like that, that head will
turn back up towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just like when we do the super
cropping outside or we do the trellising
[SPEAKER_00]: on our photo periods outside, we bend
those heads down underneath that trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: to expose those lower branches and allow
those lower branches to catch those main
[SPEAKER_00]: heads to give us that even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do feel the need to train your
autoflowers and you want to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I would say the best method,
you know, methodology to go with is an LST
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than straight, like cutting the
head off of it, pulling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting the main stem out to the left
and to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, watching it work out
from there, because again, it comes back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the potential stunting and also comes
back to potentially hurting your yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and not giving that plant enough recovery
time to actually build structure before it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our last topic for, uh, this second set
is nutrient timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that, uh,
Dan added to the agenda that I had not
[SPEAKER_02]: really considered, uh, because he and I
approach, um, uh, feeding the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, autoflowers slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I start the process plant in a pot
that already has its full, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition amendments, um, already in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, all I add to autoflowers,
uh, during the run myself is just,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, compost teas and, uh, you know,
like, uh, like K and F related sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do know that there are people
like Dan who, um, will sometimes amend,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, as you start the, the, the flower
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so this is kind of your idea,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so why don't you explain, um,
how, why the nutrient timing is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a little more precarious with
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I'll caveat this with container
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I typically, I'm not typically,
I am an organic grower in the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the breeding cycles,
I'm looking, I'm doing phenohunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sifting through a lot of these seeds
and I'm using extremely small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this relates a majority to the
home grower than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's getting into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have one, two gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have seen some really nice stuff
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see that they get big and smaller
containers and they go out and they
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase them and they want to do an
organic run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they buy, there are several brands out
there, um, that offer pre-made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, soil or soil-less mediums that
have heavy nutritional value in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most autoflowers can make it all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I believe that there's also a
timing thing too, just like if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using fertigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was growing completely with
salts and Pro-Mix HP, as the plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: progress, I would alternate between a
bloom, not alternate, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would meld a, a grow nutrient into a
bloom nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that plant progressed into
bloom, I'd phase out the actual growth
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it to give an even transition of
like the maturity stages of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as she was in veg, she got more of a
grow, dealt the nitrogen levels and things
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once she became a teenager, you start
giving it a little bit more bloom food to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that, that, that bloom cycle that's
coming into that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as she's getting more into the
sexually mature side of going into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, it's going to need more of that
phosphorus and potassium things of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you focus more on that when it came
back to feeding with salts and to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the top dressing, I do the same
thing is when I noticed that plant has got
[SPEAKER_00]: out of its fed stage and it's into its,
its pre flower stage where it's showing
[SPEAKER_00]: its pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in two weeks it's going to
start raging into its, its sexual maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to potentially need that
extra little boost that may not totally be
[SPEAKER_00]: in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a dry amendment top
dress, you need time for the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: life to break down some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it could be, you know,
available ready with the top dress,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are a lot of other things that
need to have a little bit of a breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, just like when we make
our own homemade soils, we take,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll take a base, we add some
castings, we add some manures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we add the perlite, the rice halls,
and we may add some, some dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I do is let it sit
for like two weeks before I use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let all that microbiology get up and alive
and ready to go before I introduce my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a, if you are an organic
grower, even if you're a salt based grower
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're using smaller containers,
I believe that this nutrient timing thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when you're in flower,
you're not struggling, and you then turn
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you overfeed, then you burn your
plant, or you harm your yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you come back to another impactful site
of disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just wanted to make sure
that people keep it in mind that the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism of these plants is very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those nutrient needs could shift on
you before you know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, another thing that to point out
is that, you know, Jeff Lowenfels has
[SPEAKER_02]: talked a lot about the low nutrient needs
of the autoflower plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike, you know, like super hungry photo
periods, the ruderalis aspect of the
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower, I really think causes it to
need less food throughout the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think that when you overfeed
them, I think that's another quick way to
[SPEAKER_02]: get to stunting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if folks are using any kind
of very readily available nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a liquid or something bottled,
you know, whether it's salts or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there are very bioavailable
organic foods as well that just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it takes no effort for the
microbe life in the soil to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it accessible to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of like force feeding
food really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so don't feel like you need to feed
your autoflower plants the same way that
[SPEAKER_02]: you feed a hungry photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just experiencing autoflowers
for the first time, err on the
[SPEAKER_02]: underfeeding instead of the overfeeding
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also, you know, it kind of turns
that into an advantage because you really
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't take as much nutrition to grow an
autoflower plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I'm a big fan of the Kiss Organics
nutrient pack for my autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I will use that mixed with
my nitrogen of choice, which is dehydrated
[SPEAKER_02]: pig's blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'll make sure that my soil
is amended, germinate that seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, water and other than composting,
I'm pretty much done for its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do tend to be a little more hands
off than a lot of folks who like to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, feed and poke at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will second to your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I use for my top dress is the Kiss
Organics nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
It's got everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I keep, I've got a big bag or I got a
bucket of it in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets one of the, I mean, I use it and
then if I'm outdoor, I'll use down to
[SPEAKER_00]: earth all purpose and down to earth bio
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three things that I use for
my top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The all purpose has got a really broad
spectrum of bioavailability, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like different biological availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nutrient aspects and then the bio live
has got an even more increased
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the combination of the two seem to do
really, really well outdoor for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything else that you want to add on
nutrient timing before we go to commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me run with a mic on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is cannabis breeder,
Dan Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the big finish, set three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us focus on starting with fluffiness
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's interesting because
auto flowers have got a reputation of
[SPEAKER_02]: being fluffier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really think it's important to talk
about not only the fact that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: fluffier, but also whether or not you're
growing them indoors or outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we should handle these
individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll do the outdoor part and you do the
indoor part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're growing outdoor plants,
there's something, even though the sun is
[SPEAKER_02]: more intense than your light in your grow
tent or your grow room, the relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: between the light and the plant is
different than the sun and the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And auto flowers just about everywhere
will grow fluffier outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the flowers will look
larger than their actual weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of have to choose in to
embrace that because it's what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they smell good,
they taste good, they look impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are going to be fluffier,
which where I live in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_02]: Northwest, where it's especially humid is
actually an advantage because if you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a fan going, you're less likely to get
any kind of a mold rot situation or a
[SPEAKER_02]: flower rot situation because they're
constantly getting, you know, dried out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the core of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The downside of it is if somebody is
looking for those tight California style
[SPEAKER_02]: photo period nugs, this will have a
different bag appeal than Photoshop or not
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshop, a photo period will have.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see with them indoors,
Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them as a very tighter flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity of the light and I believe
the length of the light hours that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them causes a difference in the
morphology of the actual flower itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see tighter buds, I see better structure
wise presenting that bag appeal that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: also used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a complete morphology shift than
being grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I really do prefer my auto
flowers, how they come out, how they look
[SPEAKER_02]: being grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of sun grown and I think
that the terpene profiles outdoors are a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit wider because the spectrum of light is
a lot wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that I have grown auto flowers
both outdoors and indoors, I really do
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer the indoor finished product more as
far as like bag appeal goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just look sexier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm unfamiliar with the study,
but I've heard people refer to a study
[SPEAKER_02]: around cannabis that suggests that sun
grown plants actually produced more leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's going to be more challenging
to trim one grown outdoors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor seems to have, like you said,
that fluffier-ness to it than it does
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think traditionally ruteralis in its
makeup is leafier anyway, but I have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that increase when it's out underneath the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen, again, like I've seen it
indoor and I've seen it outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I see it more so outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does make it a little bit more
difficult to give it that Mendo style like
[SPEAKER_00]: cut where it's like trimmed down and like
a Brazilian cut, for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_00]: term, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a little leafier cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have the sugar leaf there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it adds to the flower,
but like it does present a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a challenge when it comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I caught you talking at the Camp
Ruteralis Auto Flower Cup event,
[SPEAKER_02]: you also were talking about the calyx to
leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you talk us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is a negative side effect
of the ruteralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a bad thing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is unfortunately part of,
I've touched on it slightly through this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, of something about the genetic
marker of the day neutral coming across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of likes to have to hang out
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was growing, I see it as a
ruteral trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my example for that is I've had the
recent pleasure of talking with Nick from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Source Gardens about his Pinkelberry
and what I saw with Pinkelberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pinkelberry had that mechanic of a
higher leaf ratio to the flower ratio on a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific phenotype that I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It triggered very early into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking like at the equinox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a hunch that if I added an
heirloom that I could see higher auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering results in the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that higher leaf ratio, you know,
the leaf to calyx ratio, that higher ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: just seems to be there with ruteralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating and I'm working to try to
select that out of what I'm doing because
[SPEAKER_00]: like it seems to be the biggest complaint
from farms to home growers is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so we got a lot of trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: More so than we did bud weight because of
the fluffiness we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: because most farms traditionally grow them
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of farms that are
growing auto flowers in massive warehouses
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that the leaf is so intense on
some of these varieties of auto flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: that instead of using scissors,
I want to use like the razor clippers like
[SPEAKER_02]: they use on your neck when you get a
haircut, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so thick with the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that a lot of the
cultivars will have that are showing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of their ruteralis aspects visually
because you know, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some look like rooties and some don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tend to go towards the ones that
don't look like ruteralis because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: got better bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of them also, the leaves all
down the flower especially on the main
[SPEAKER_02]: stem will look like they're pointed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean when the leaves are
praying, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know how on a bright sunny day when
the plant is really happy, it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's reaching up to the sun and the leaves
can kind of like get this gentle crease in
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we generally refer to that
as praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean is that the leaf and the
flower matter will grow at an upwards
[SPEAKER_02]: angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always reminiscent to me of the
throne, the iron throne on Game of
[SPEAKER_02]: Thrones, how they look sharp and they look
like they're going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the smoke is going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great and the terpene profile is
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that look looks like there's something
wrong with the plant to me having come
[SPEAKER_02]: from photo periods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it looks janky, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's something wrong with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does everything we want it to do
except for look as expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I've smoked a lot of
great stuff that does that, but it is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely not my preference and something
that I generally don't grow a second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like earlier on, like this is,
besides the straight up pointing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how we were talking about how like,
you know, you may have a few of them
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and they may not be like larger
plants, but they grow real super dense
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another issue that makes them look real
janky is like once you get done,
[SPEAKER_00]: say you got a nice big fat baseball bat
cola or a couple big fat baseball bat
[SPEAKER_00]: colas and you got it down, it's dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going through, you're trying to
trim it up to get it into the jars and get
[SPEAKER_00]: it separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start separating that flower from
the main stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to, when you pull that flower
out, you'll notice like the part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that was resting against the actual
main stem is kind of off colored and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lighter, usually a lighter green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're growing a purple plant,
you'll see like reds and like almost under
[SPEAKER_00]: development deep inside there because of
the way that everything with that leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that that structure is grown is
compacted inside there, that light can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there to mature that part of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the outside looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenes look fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start bucking those things down
into jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, this looks a little
off, but it's completely fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes you suspicious every single
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time it makes you suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if we had the better,
the node spacing that we have like with
[SPEAKER_00]: photo periods to where like you have a
bud, you have some stretch, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, you have some stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get into flower, those bud sets
tend to alternate up the flower and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: typically grow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most modern day photo periods anyway,
but ruderalis or auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they still tend to do that without that
offset to kind of give that flower its
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to fully develop in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it just kind of looks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually to an untrained eye,
like, eh, I don't know if I want anything
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because that is the same
attribute that gives people the big colas
[SPEAKER_02]: that they refer to as like baseball bats
or your arm, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some, some people are all like,
Oh look, it's one big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then other people will be
like, Oh, there's no internotal spacing
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's all grown together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's janky stuff going on
along the stem, which it's still great
[SPEAKER_02]: smokeable flower, but, um, it looks like
it's immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks immature, but it inevitably is
not the, the actual definition of mids
[SPEAKER_02]: actually pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, down to the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing that we're going to talk
about is, um, soil germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one of the challenges with
auto flowers is the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we don't want to transplant them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as auto flowers have become more
popular, um, it is the common suggestion
[SPEAKER_02]: that you just go ahead and germinate the
seed, um, in the, in the soil of the pot
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's going to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, while we do have, you know,
a fix for this, uh, when I first started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing auto flowers is it was a super
drag because, um, it, it is more
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging to germinate in soil than it
is in paper towel or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people hang and put it in paper towel
and then hang, hang the bag on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a, uh, orientation to go up,
but, um, you know, it, it, it's so easy
[SPEAKER_02]: for the soil to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so easy for, if you're outdoors,
some varmint to come and eat that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's a real hassle and unless
you've got a good solution for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it can be a real, a real drag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, you know, Dan and I, and,
and, and probably a lot of other auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flower people came to the same solution
separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we didn't realize that we did the
same thing until we were preparing for
[SPEAKER_02]: this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so Dan, why don't you go ahead and
explain the, the solution that we like for
[SPEAKER_02]: germinating in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So germinating in the soil, one of the
things that I really, really like to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the moisture kept above,
you know, you know, maintain the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: on the surface level above that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do a couple of things to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is I put a little tiny like
nine ounce party cup dome over the central
[SPEAKER_00]: location of where that seed has been
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clear one, a clear party club,
not a red one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clear, like you're at the high school
dance punch cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best way I could describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that clear cup over it and then
you still have, uh, if you're growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: like a two or three gallon pot and trying
to germinate in that, you still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: large surface area of exposed soil to wind
circulation in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil wicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that soil is dry, even though you
have that party cup over top of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil will dry out around that cup and
then tend to leach that moisture from
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can't put the cup down to the
depth of where it's going to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, you know, three to six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I also do is I layer rice halls
around that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got the seed protected by a
micro humidity dome, the clear cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you avoid the moisture wicking
and maintain a level, uh, moist soil with
[SPEAKER_00]: the rice halls as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rice halls protect the large
exposed area, the clear cup covers your
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually within three to four days,
that seed will pop its head right up out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to touch on your, you know,
not only do we have to deal with varmints
[SPEAKER_00]: and drying out, we also have to deal with
like certain types of insects in said soil
[SPEAKER_00]: too, especially if you're growing in large
beds or if you're growing outdoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in a garden, you got to
worry about what I like to call like the
[SPEAKER_00]: roly-polies, you know, they will come
through and they will eat your seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: slugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have, I mean, especially if
you're growing in an organic matter area,
[SPEAKER_00]: slugs absolutely love dead decaying plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those slugs also like live plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have come out many mornings to
missing tops off of these new seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: that have come up in like my Hulu culture
beds or even in the pots that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: around there because the slugs have found
them and had a snack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have lived that hell myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you put holes in the top of your
plastic dome?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep that dome on there until they break
up and they're turning true to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they turn true to the light,
meaning the head is completely pointed up,
[SPEAKER_00]: its cantalons are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first set starting to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then work the rice halls in around that
base of that main stem and then let it
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed with my watering schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's slightly different with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put holes in the top of the cup so that
there is a little bit of airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely restricted airflow so that
I don't lose my moisture inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also just want to make sure that it
doesn't get too hot under the cup or the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity spikes too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, try it yourself and see what
you prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you know, there are lots of things
that you can do to creatively not have to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy more plastic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly the clear party cups work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very lucky because of where I live,
there is a walnut tree on the property and
[SPEAKER_02]: the prior occupants had taken all of these
one liter clear soda bottles and cut them
[SPEAKER_02]: in half and put them on the branches of
the walnut tree to protect the young
[SPEAKER_02]: walnuts from the squirrels who love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm not really harvesting that
walnut tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, every spring,
the winter winds blow these these one
[SPEAKER_02]: liter plastic bottles out of the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll just go and I will harvest the
plastic off the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it essentially is is a is a
one liter clear plastic bottle and cut in
[SPEAKER_02]: half and so that you can use the top and
you can use the bottom as domes for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so using the top of the bottle,
there's already an air hole, maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bigger than I would want,
but it works fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bottom, I poke a few holes in
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the reason why I'm telling you this
is not that I expect that you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: walnut tree at your house, but that if you
look around through your recycling and
[SPEAKER_02]: other places that you use plastic in your
life, chances are you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to find some plastic at your house or your
neighborhood that you can upcycle into
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting your autoflower seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely upcycling is always a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so yes, soil germination is a pain in
the ass until you get your recipe down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get your recipe down,
the the soil germination just becomes a
[SPEAKER_02]: non issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was starting out, you know,
it took me it took me two rounds to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that I had a problem and then and
then a third third round to solve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so the last thing that we're going to
hit on here is is the making of
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm mostly going to let Dan to speak
to this since he's the he's the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want I want to point out that,
you know, I am not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: At best, I am a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do enjoy taking pollen off of a male
plant and putting it on a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, suddenly, oh, boom,
something something that's a cross of the
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I started getting turned on to
autoflowers, I was like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make some of my favorite photo
periods, autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just I'll just, you know,
you know, put an autoflower and a photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that's when I realized,
oh, they're not all going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm introducing a new trait that is not
usually what I'm doing when I'm just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pollen chucking with photo
periods, which are like so easy to make
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Dan, I recognize that this is not a an
autoflower breeding episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you would just give us a nice
sketch of what the steps are to breed an
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower to a a photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, folks can kind of get a picture of
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that is something that tantalizes
them, well, then they can start doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for most folks, they'll just have it
in their head and they'll they'll they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that, oh, autoflowers are
different animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep it at like a 10,000 foot
level that, you know, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: people can choose whether they want to be
tantalized by this or if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, leave it to the rest of us
to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, and we'll start with that
photo period to photo period is very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple when you put a male to a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk on I'm not going to
go into feminization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say pollen donor and
recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a pollen donor for your photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pass it to the female on
your photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting children are going to be
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that said, there is going to be
a mix of genetic expression in that first
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the gene code matches up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may found some nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to do another generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflower to autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use a pollen donor and autoflower
and you cross it to a female autoflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent of those offspring will
be autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get, again, different
kinds of phenotypical expressions across
[SPEAKER_00]: that first lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have true
autoflowering day-neutral results.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to making your favorite
photo exhibit autoflowering traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit more work involved
because you're then dealing with those
[SPEAKER_00]: varying traits that you're seeing
expressed in the resultant offspring or
[SPEAKER_00]: the F1 of the photo period cross-auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't matter if it goes male
photo to female auto or male auto to
[SPEAKER_00]: female photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to search through that gene pool
looking for genetic markers and traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ruderalis parent that you introduced
to the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that builds upon you having to search
through that set of seeds and then moving
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next generation using a male and a
female from that first set of seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the F2, your numbers are going to
typically increase in your autoflowering
[SPEAKER_00]: expression because the day-neutral trait
is recessive and you have to bring it out
[SPEAKER_00]: in dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to bring it out in dominance,
you have to work the fallial generations
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: By F3, you've got a really good autoflower
day-neutral trait that's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of phenohunt a
little bit because you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice mix of fast-flowering photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have what some people call
super autos, which is a terrible term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically an autoflower or a photo
period that's stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some of the day-neutral trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets to the stage where I call
optimal polarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like 80s hairspray styles,
like straight sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it needs 1212 to finish its life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still not a proper true
autoflowering plant that we know them as
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that F3 generation, you're going to
see a conglomerate of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by F3, you could probably find
representations of your photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: parent that you want to progress forward
with the autoflowering trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by F4, you're kind of honing in a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by F5, pretty much everything that
you're spitting out of the inbred line is
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this brings up another aspect that is
not pleasurable when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers, which is so often during this
breeding process, we take clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And autoflowers do not clone properly
because if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you clone a plant, your clones are
still actually the age of the mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they're like these new,
cute, young looking plants, they are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a plant that has the age of the
mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since autoflowers, they've got such a
short life cycle, if you take a clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is probably going to immediately flower
because it's on the same flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule as the mother plant that you took
it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the reason why I bring this up at
this point is because taking clones is a
[SPEAKER_02]: way to intentionally, I don't know,
bank genetics while you are going through
[SPEAKER_02]: the autoflower or the photo period
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dan, please tell us about how
inconvenient it is when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed autoflowers that you can't clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a royal pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been chasing something for probably
nine years and I see it out of one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never get a matching parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either the male or the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having that clone, I can't hold
onto it until I either find the matching
[SPEAKER_00]: male or I find another female that comes
up and I can do a reversal on to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lock in the specific trait that I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been elusive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For almost a decade now and it's
frustrating and I keep trying for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes the process complicated and
not having that clone also keep the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: to seed identical ability is pretty much
gone until you work all these generations
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the homozygous expression to where
pretty much all the seeds look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a clone, I can back cross,
I can forward cross again, I can reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so many different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in with the autoflower world,
you don't have the ability to hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: that precious clone that you've been
hunting through and you sifted for to
[SPEAKER_00]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's frustrating, but to me,
I appreciate the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me work harder to get to the
ending result that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you gave it that nice spin at
the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't just seem to be like a bitch
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not a bitch only.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the straight and narrow of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also like to turn that into the
motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me doing what I'm doing because I
know eventually it'll show up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it makes you want to work for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably one of the reasons why
there's so many phenos in autoflower seed
[SPEAKER_02]: still too, because isolating these phenos
without the ability to clone is so much
[SPEAKER_02]: more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something as simple as doing
like an S1, what a lot of guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they found this amazing female
through a sift and they clone her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take clones at a mature state,
label them all, and then flower out all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, okay, we can chuck these other
five or six, but we like these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't have the ability to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ability to have that sitting
around and like, okay, now I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to lock it in and I want to get seeds out
to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could turn around, take a clone from one
of the other clones, flower it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse it, and then pollinate that same
mother locking in that trait, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make those seeds a prime example of what
that clone only would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so that brings us to the end,
Dan, of all of the things that we dislike
[SPEAKER_02]: about autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually more than just joining me,
you helped me design and put this show
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been involved from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate your partnership in making
these lists of challenges of autoflowers
[SPEAKER_02]: and then going through them with me today
so that we can air them out publicly so
[SPEAKER_02]: people can be aware of them and also the
ones that we've got some kinds of fixes
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that we're able to provide those
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know that as autoflowers
evolve, we're going to see more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: of these unsavory attributes get under our
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks so much, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for giving me the
opportunity to sit down and create this
[SPEAKER_00]: list and help build this show so we could
get proper representation of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we're frustrated, but here's some
fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we do and how we handle
those fixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a very valuable tool and
some information for people who are either
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting started or who have been
growing them and are looking for answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see that even though we're
evangelistic about it, I still get
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated on a regular basis and
sometimes open my door and just go,
[SPEAKER_00]: ugh, start again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, dear listener, enjoy listening
and learning from Dan Jimmy as much as I
[SPEAKER_02]: do, I recommend that you go ahead and you
follow him on Instagram where you'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: continually entertained with more of his
tips and tricks and beautiful flower
[SPEAKER_02]: photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do that, you can either just easily go
to the Shaping Fire episode page for this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode and all the links are there,
but you can also go to his Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: gnome, that's G-N-O-M-E underscore
automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's gnome underscore automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is his seed company providing
autoflower genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also check out his individual
personal Instagram at fullduplex
[SPEAKER_02]: underscore AFN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fullduplex underscore AFN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this is not Dan's first time on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so kind to join us back on episode
73 to go through a history of autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are just getting into
autoflowers and falling in love with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that you check out that
history of autoflowers covering the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years or so of autoflowers,
what most of us are kind of calling modern
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers now because there's a lot of
interesting history and understanding in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also, since I am active with
growing and evangelizing autoflowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see a lot of autoflower
photographs and information on my two
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagrams, the ones for Shaping Fire,
the show that you're listening to right
[SPEAKER_02]: now at Shaping Fire, and also my personal
