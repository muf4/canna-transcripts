[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of every cannabis season,
plants are cut low on the stalk and taken
[SPEAKER_00]: away to be processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What remains is a small nub coming out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below, in the soil, is a very much alive
and active cannabis root system
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with mycorrhizae, microbes,
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than being a trophy showing how
thriving a plant was before it was cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down, there's not been much use for the
plant plant's root ball in modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until now.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Natasha Riz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha has a PhD in experimental medicine
from the University of British Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: and also holds a master of science and a
bachelor's degree of science in human
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha has over 15 years of experience as
a health and nutrition researcher and has
[SPEAKER_00]: published seven first author peer-reviewed
publications, two first author reviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: and co-authored eight peer-reviewed
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha is a researcher and product
formulator specializing in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds that target the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha is co-founder of Riz Remy Skincare
and Therapeutics where she designs topical
[SPEAKER_00]: products for pain and inflammatory
conditions as well as beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about Natasha's
new paper entitled Cannabis Roots a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional therapy with future potential
for treating inflammation and pain as
[SPEAKER_00]: published in the Journal of Cannabis and
Cannabinoid Research and co-authored with
[SPEAKER_00]: world-renowned cannabis expert Dr. Ethan
Russo and David Remiard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show Natasha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your paper is so much more enjoyable to
read and accessible than many others I've
[SPEAKER_00]: read in science and in some parts it feels
as much like a history text as a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between a paper like
this one and one that is simply reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: the results of an experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah well I don't know about simply
reporting the results of experiments
[SPEAKER_01]: because lots of work goes into reporting
that but what's different about what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: created here is we're like you said we're
going through the history of how cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: roots were used and then we're trying to
find clues from newer research to
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate some of that together to show
that the active compounds that are found
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis roots even though they
haven't been studied specifically from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis roots there is some other
research we can put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas and when you're looking at a
research study that's reporting on
[SPEAKER_01]: something new or a single compound they're
really going into the details of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental methods and usually they're
showing multiple ways of doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment to show that they're actually
can convince you and prove that their
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this may be more enjoyable to the
non-scientist reader because it is a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: history of how the roots were used and
then does a brief summary of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature showing again like how these
active compounds would have been used for
[SPEAKER_01]: treating inflammation or pain or other
different conditions and then we summarize
[SPEAKER_01]: the research by showing methods of
application and it is interesting you say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's different than other papers because
when we first submitted it it was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: to another journal and they didn't really
understand so they thought even the title
[SPEAKER_01]: that we weren't actually talking about the
roots of cannabis they thought it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: a folksy like oh getting back to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I had written a lot of there was
even more information about kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: forward steps of how to use the roots in
recipes and things like that and they even
[SPEAKER_01]: made kind of a snarky comment like oh this
reads like a Reader's Digest paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man that's a diss that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No and it was just they didn't understand
the paper and so and that's part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why it took us a while to get this
paper published because really Ethan and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started on this project and my husband
Dave Reimelart is also an author so the
[SPEAKER_01]: three of us have been working on this
project for about a year and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: really how Ethan and I actually became
friends and colleagues was back at ICRS so
[SPEAKER_01]: the International Cannabinoid Research
Society meeting in Vancouver in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Vancouver and that was my first
time going to this meeting and my first
[SPEAKER_01]: time meeting Ethan and so when we first
met I said to him what are you doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots because he was still with GW
Pharmaceuticals back at that time and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was like Natasha what are you talking
about the roots and so we had a discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and I'm like well my husband
David he's a legal cannabis grower in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada and we've been using the roots to
make topicals and so he was fascinated by
[SPEAKER_01]: this and Ethan went back and he went
through the literature and he put together
[SPEAKER_01]: this really nice 30 point power page or
PowerPoint presentation going over the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole history of the roots and then he
sent that to me and he was like Natasha we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to write a paper about this and so
that's really why the first part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper really is an overview of the
historical use of it and it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: quotes and so we had to put that together
as kind of a story and start putting it in
[SPEAKER_01]: some different themes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah like for fever, for inflammation,
for skin burns, for hard tumors,
[SPEAKER_01]: even for childbirth there's many different
ways throughout history that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been using the roots and I know there's
people who are making products these days
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the scientific realm and in the
academic realm no one was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots so we felt it was really
important to get this information put
[SPEAKER_01]: together published to start getting more
interest and actually pursuing some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know gosh I've got a bunch of things
to say so let's see where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one going all the way back to
the roots you know when I was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: people about my excitement about
interviewing you on this show I too had to
[SPEAKER_00]: clarify because I said oh yeah I'm doing a
show on cannabis roots and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't you already do the history of
cannabis with Sunil Agarwal like in
[SPEAKER_00]: episode five and I'm like yeah yeah not
those kind of roots the root ball and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you could see this look of blankness and
then they're like cool you know because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know mostly we throw away root balls
but after your paper I think people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be using them a lot more and then
also it's fun to hear you talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting of Ethan because I got the other
side of that story he and I were at lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's all like yeah Natasha asked me
about root balls and he says I lit up and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's all like I knew right away that we'd
be friends you know because he's had an
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in root balls too but had never
really actually had a chance to dig into
[SPEAKER_00]: it so right on so you know since you're
reaching back so far into ancient medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of these texts were there some
ailments that were you know enshrouded by
[SPEAKER_00]: outdated language that you had to do
secondary research just to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were saying they were using the root
ball to cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a little bit and I tried to clarify
especially when they're referring to hard
[SPEAKER_01]: tumors we weren't sure if they were
referring to cancer or more like an
[SPEAKER_01]: abscess or a sore or a type of ulcer that
has like tumor hard tumor like properties
[SPEAKER_01]: so we were pretty careful in how we
interpreted those interpretations of how
[SPEAKER_01]: they were using the roots and even when we
looked at some of the compounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and went into newer studies with
cell culture experiments and animal
[SPEAKER_01]: studies they didn't really find much
anti-cancer activity with these compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: so we were careful with how we covered
that part of the roots just because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's so many potential anti-cancer
properties with the cannabinoids and other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the cannabis plant but the roots
might not be the best for anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: properties the area where it was very
exciting and I see a lot of potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots is more for topical use so
putting it on top of your skin and using
[SPEAKER_01]: it to treat inflammatory conditions
redness arthritis and also gout there's
[SPEAKER_01]: numerous mentions like it was almost hard
to summarize it all without just going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and on and on about how often the ancient
medicine makers were using cannabis roots
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat gout so that was exciting to read
about especially anyone who's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: suffered from gout or tried to find
treatments for it a lot of them don't work
[SPEAKER_01]: that well so and actually I should bring
up when I was so when Ethan and I were
[SPEAKER_01]: first working on this paper he invited me
to patients at a time in Baltimore last
[SPEAKER_01]: year to speak about it and so that was
great I got to do a talk at the conference
[SPEAKER_01]: met a lot of amazing people but this one
man came up and he was a cannabis farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: and he came and talked to me after and he
was telling me that he doesn't consume any
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and he was working on a cannabis
farm and he was like I wasn't touching any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis my only job was to handle
the root waste and so he said he was
[SPEAKER_01]: handling all the root waste and they were
keeping some of it in the freezer just on
[SPEAKER_01]: the like hey this might have some
properties and he said just by handling
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots his gout and his his toes had
gone away and he had made that connection
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was just like blown away after he
saw my talk as he was like oh my goodness
[SPEAKER_01]: just by handling them my goat had gotten
better and so that really intrigued me and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I kept talking about the goat I
personally don't haven't experienced any
[SPEAKER_01]: of these types of treatments or like I
don't suffer from any goat or inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions so I can only go on what other
people are telling me but I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's an application of the roots
that's worth pursuing right on so I know
[SPEAKER_00]: this next question is big so I'm gonna
kind of set you up for it and let you go
[SPEAKER_00]: here so so you know one of the things that
struck me immediately in reading your
[SPEAKER_00]: paper is that you know you're talking
about a whole new community of active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds then we're usually talking about
with cannabinoids you know usually when I
[SPEAKER_00]: read papers I'm pretty familiar with the
active components but most of the active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in the root are new to me and
it's really exciting to have some new
[SPEAKER_00]: healing attributes of cannabis to learn
about so before we get into the historical
[SPEAKER_00]: healing applications for the compounds
after the break before the break would you
[SPEAKER_00]: review that just the names of the active
compounds from the abstract of the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of familiarize us with their names
so that when we start talking about their
[SPEAKER_00]: applications folks are a little familiar
with what they are yeah so what's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting about the roots is they're
very low in cannabinoids like THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: what they contain is other compounds so
one of the main compounds we talked a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about in the paper is called fritillin so
this is found in the roots at about it as
[SPEAKER_01]: reported from older studies at 12.8
milligrams per kilogram and then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: another compound called epifridillin
epifridillinol and that's about 21
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams per kilogram so these two
compounds are triterpenoids and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been isolated from other plants they're
found in many other plants as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and so they've been isolated from
cannabis and characterized by but no one
[SPEAKER_01]: has specifically studied them from
cannabis but they've taken them from other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and done some preliminary animal
experiments and shown that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: really potent anti-inflammatory activity
anti-pain anti-redness they can help
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent the influx of inflammatory cells
and so those compounds are most likely the
[SPEAKER_01]: active compounds that are providing a lot
of the anti-inflammatory activity there's
[SPEAKER_01]: also some interesting alkaloids that are
in the roots called cannabisatavine and
[SPEAKER_01]: this compound has been isolated from
cannabis root but there's no research on
[SPEAKER_01]: it so we don't actually know what this
compound does and then another thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: was interesting is there was one report of
a group isolating carvone which is
[SPEAKER_01]: monoterpene it has it's the major
monoterpene found in spearmint so when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smell that spearmint minty scent that's
pretty much carvone you're smelling and so
[SPEAKER_01]: they found that the root had this
distinguished smell is what they said and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they went to further analyze it and
found that it was carvone and carvone is
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting because it's being studied
also as an anti-inflammatory anti-pain
[SPEAKER_01]: compound especially with regards to like
spearmint essential oil there's a clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial where they're studying it topically
like putting it on your skin for treating
[SPEAKER_01]: osteoarthritis so we can take some of
these compounds and then start put that
[SPEAKER_01]: the story together and realize I go all
these compounds are playing a role and who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows some of these old concoctions may
have well had some I'll say contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever cannabinoids from other parts
of the plant so realistically I think
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant formulas that include parts of
the roots and the cannabinoids will work
[SPEAKER_01]: best but I think these compounds in the
roots have a lot of potential to also play
[SPEAKER_01]: a role with helping with a variety of
medicinal applications including redness
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation and pain right on before we
go to break one last question you know
[SPEAKER_00]: these these new active compounds that
we're learning about I mean they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: new to science but they're new to a lot of
us cannabis medicine folk you know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that they are something other
than than cannabinoids because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about them and cannabinoids you
know why would you say scientifically that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not considered cannabinoids like
definitionally why are they not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids well a cannabinoid is a
unique compound that's like THC CBD like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this it's a class of structurally
like unique compounds and so these are
[SPEAKER_01]: just different completely different
compounds so they're just I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: clarify to a lot of people are really
confused about cannabinoids being found in
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants I saw some people talking
about it on Facebook today and arguing
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and using one of Ethan's paper to
justify their point but they were actually
[SPEAKER_01]: arguing the wrong thing so when we say
cannabinoids these compounds are specific
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cannabis plant and that's like THC
and CBD and there's many other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids but there's compounds that in
other plants that act like cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and can work through the endocannabinoid
system in our body but people are saying
[SPEAKER_01]: oh there's cannabinoids and other plants
but there aren't so anyway cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: are a unique family of compounds that are
unique to the cannabis plant but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not found in large amounts in the roots
thank you that's that's the answer I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and you took it even farther
along that path you know we had Dr. Russo
[SPEAKER_00]: on this show talking about how you know
his nutrition paper right a nutrition to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the endocannabinoid system and a
lot of people took that paper as you were
[SPEAKER_00]: describing that oh look there's
cannabinoids and all these other things
[SPEAKER_00]: like well they're not really cannabinoids
in these other plants they're just other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional plants that support your
endocannabinoid system so yeah take your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids but also take this other
nutrition and I think that's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: delineation you make yeah and like
especially with beta-cariophylline comes
[SPEAKER_01]: up a lot because and there's a paper that
kind of is at fault here the way the title
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's like oh here's a they call it a
cannabinoid but beta-cariophylline works
[SPEAKER_01]: through the CB2 receptor and it works
through our endocannabinoid system and can
[SPEAKER_01]: boost cannabinoids but it is not a
cannabinoid right you know just making it
[SPEAKER_00]: all very very clear yeah yeah so we're so
let's go ahead and take our first short
[SPEAKER_00]: break and be right back when we get back
we're gonna be talking about the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: health benefits of using the root ball
system you're listening to shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: and my guest today is cannabis cannabis
health researcher Natalia Riz we humans
[SPEAKER_00]: are attracted to plants because they offer
us relief and are a whole lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes though the best parts are buried
inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty extraction technology when it
comes to cannabis it is extraordinarily
[SPEAKER_00]: important to extract its precious oils
without changing them in the process we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents that all work together since
1994 Eden Labs has been developing
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction technology and processing
processes to do just that Eden Labs was
[SPEAKER_00]: founded by a cannabis loving engineer
during the early days of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: in California and the expanded Eden team
has been designing and building
[SPEAKER_00]: industry-leading solutions for cannabis
extraction ever since Eden Labs flagship
[SPEAKER_00]: product is the newly improved high flow
co2 extractor as other extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: companies enter the market it is the high
flow from Eden Labs that everyone chases
[SPEAKER_00]: and tries to compare themselves with not
only that but the improved automation
[SPEAKER_00]: software allows data to be collected
stored and studied Eden Labs can outfit
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole lab Eden's cold finger ethanol
extractor creates astonishing whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts working alone or in tandem with
an initial stream distilling step to
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate mono terpenes before extracting
the rest of the botanical constituents
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden offers you many options including
vacuum distillation column distilling
[SPEAKER_00]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery when you partner with
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs your lab team is enrolled into
the Eden Labs training program to boost
[SPEAKER_00]: their understanding of Eden's best
practices to ensure that your outputs are
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you require for your
application whether it be dab oil oil for
[SPEAKER_00]: pen cartridges or edibles when you work
with Eden you're not just buying the tech
[SPEAKER_00]: you are buying dedicated customer support
to help you attain your business goals too
[SPEAKER_00]: you can hear Eden's CEO AC Braddock talk
about the company's values during shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: fire episode 19 that was all about co2
extraction so many of the new companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market just smell opportunity slap an
extractor together and hire a marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: company Eden Labs has been listening to
feedback from extractors and consumers for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 25 years now they care about both
you and your consumer partner with Eden
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs to extract astonishing cannabis oils
and terpenes that you will be proud of go
[SPEAKER_00]: to shaping fire comm Ford slash Eden to
find out more now that the health benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes have become well known in the
cannabis industry people everywhere are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the purest terpenes without
adulterants the problem with most terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: providers is that they're not sourced
naturally and instead are made as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of refining petroleum and that's
so sketchy the terpene sold by true
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are entirely different they are
certified organic non-gmo and food grade
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that they are extracted from
real plant sources there are no solvents
[SPEAKER_00]: of any kind they are distilled only with
steam that's right only steam in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes from true terpenes are so pure
that you can eat them not only that but
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stack them with better results too
what i mean is other companies terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: have got a few percent of impurities and
when you stack those terpenes to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: blend you're adding a variety of
impurities that degrade your final product
[SPEAKER_00]: true terpenes also have strain specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin poison sunset sherbet
and granddaddy purple true terpenes has
[SPEAKER_00]: robust and supportive customer service so
your questions will get answered fast and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently if you've shopped for terpes
before you know how rare that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience if you are a
cannabis product developer these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpes you want to add to your oil or
edible or capsule or whatever true
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are simply the best your money
can buy don't try and make a premium
[SPEAKER_00]: product with substandard terpes choose
true terpenes for a top shelf experience
[SPEAKER_00]: go to shapingfire.com board slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter welcome
back you are listening to shaping fire i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: your host shango los and our guest this
week is cannabis health researcher natasha
[SPEAKER_00]: riz so now we're getting to the heart of
the topic so the theme of the paper seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be that historically healers of all
kinds use the root ball for a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory issues and infections and
fevers there are so many different active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and applications that i
actually found it hard to create you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like a cogent path of questions for you
how do you prefer to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical applications in a way that people
can make sense of it yeah um so i the
[SPEAKER_01]: parts that i really like to focus on are
the topical applications so putting it on
[SPEAKER_01]: your skin there's hints at various ways of
using the cannabis route including oral
[SPEAKER_01]: even as a suppository like intractally to
help with infection but when throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: history anyway when people are using the
route orally or intractally it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more for a specific purpose so like a
medical purpose not necessarily like
[SPEAKER_01]: something you'd want to do every day
whereas the topical applications like on
[SPEAKER_01]: the skin seem like something that you
could use consistently so when patients
[SPEAKER_01]: are or throughout history when people were
taking it as an oral drink it was more for
[SPEAKER_01]: during childbirth when they were having
issues with like they couldn't stop
[SPEAKER_01]: bleeding and so there's historical
accounts in china of using the root
[SPEAKER_01]: concoction as an oral supplement to help
with bleeding during childbirth whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a richer history and many more
accounts of cannabis roots bombs and water
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions being used on the skin and
even i should bring up like if anyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: working with cannabis roots you want to be
really careful of where you're sourcing
[SPEAKER_01]: the material from because cannabis is
really good at phytoremediation meaning it
[SPEAKER_01]: can suck up bad things from the ground and
cannabis is really good at sucking up iron
[SPEAKER_01]: and heavy minerals that can accumulate and
could be dangerous if you're using it for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine so it might be better use roots
that are grown through hydroponics or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least in soil that you know doesn't have a
mineral contamination or heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination so just keep that in mind so
that might also be part of the reason why
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the route in orally might be you
might have to be a little careful about it
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas putting it on your skin it just
seems there's such a rich history of using
[SPEAKER_01]: it that way especially for as i mentioned
several times gout arthritis and joint
[SPEAKER_01]: pain but the other thing that also came up
throughout the historical accounts of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp root use was water extraction so
we know that cannabinoids are fat soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and so most of the time when we
do extractions with cannabis flowers or
[SPEAKER_01]: the parts of the plants we're using fats
or alcohol or things to extract these fat
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds the thing that was really
interesting about the roots is throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: history it's very clear that they're using
boiling water or some kind of heated type
[SPEAKER_01]: water extraction and so I'll go a little
bit over of the different ways they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using it one is they're drying the root
and using it as a powder and so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts of just using that powder as like
remixing it with water and using it on
[SPEAKER_01]: like a cut or as a poultice and then
there's other accounts of taking the root
[SPEAKER_01]: and shredding it that might be a bit
difficult because the roots are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: hard and then there's other accounts where
they're taking the root cooking it in
[SPEAKER_01]: boiling water and then using that water
extraction either to soak like other
[SPEAKER_01]: things in and then put that topically like
as a compress or they're taking let me see
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots there oh so they're also even
taking that water extraction and like
[SPEAKER_01]: boiling it down to making almost like like
a paste or a sap and then they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: other ways where they're taking even
alcohol extractions or the recipe that we
[SPEAKER_01]: used personally at home to process them of
David's cannabis roots has been actually
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a blend of fat and water and cook
that in a crock pot and use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract fat soluble and water soluble
compounds and then what you do after that
[SPEAKER_01]: is you put it in the freezer and then you
freeze off the water and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: separate the fat and the water compounds
and then do separate things with that so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah there's a lot of different things
about the roots that are different than
[SPEAKER_01]: the way most people are processing the
cannabis plant and so the main thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: the water extraction and the other thing
is that people are mostly using it
[SPEAKER_01]: topically versus you know smoking it or
eating it sure that makes sense and and
[SPEAKER_00]: during the third set we're gonna talk a
little bit more in detail about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make those but for the moment I want to
hit on you know I think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting that that there are all of
these different procedures for getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds in touch with the human body
but it's interesting that there was so
[SPEAKER_00]: much experimentation all these different
ways to essentially just get the Friedelin
[SPEAKER_00]: and Carvone and other active compounds
just to touch the body right I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's by boiling or or or cutting
it up or making a poultice it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: these are these are different methods to
essentially do the same thing which is get
[SPEAKER_00]: those essential active compounds against
the skin or in lesser cases into the body
[SPEAKER_00]: through a drink right yeah exactly yeah so
so different different you know healers
[SPEAKER_00]: would use different techniques based on
you know what their personal beliefs were
[SPEAKER_00]: or what was what was available to them one
of the things that I find interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about the this approach to is you know
you've talked about a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments that helps with you know gout
arthritis joint pain hemorrhaging from
[SPEAKER_00]: after pregnancy fever I mean this is a
pretty wide range and normally when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about cannabinoid medicine we're
like oh it's because it supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system which is the body's
master regulator and balances so many
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that that you know it all helps
the ECS and then the ECS takes care of
[SPEAKER_00]: rebalancing everything and then you get
all this relief but that's not what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this time and so what's
different with this from what it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like is that we're actually trying to get
these particular active compounds for what
[SPEAKER_00]: they uniquely do to our body's system
themselves so the Carbone is doing one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and the Friedland is doing one thing
instead of how we normally think about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid medicine which is oh it all
turns on or off something in the ECS yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean these the ECS is so like it's
everywhere on our bodies so I'm I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised if these compounds weren't
somehow targeting the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and we can kind of think of
inflammation pathways in the way we think
[SPEAKER_01]: of the endocannabinoid system so when we
say something's affecting inflammation
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a very complex process there's many
cells there's many types of inflammation
[SPEAKER_01]: some types of inflammation are good some
types are bad and then there's early
[SPEAKER_01]: modulators of inflammation that I like to
think of as like cells coming in with
[SPEAKER_01]: machine guns where they're just you know
trying to take out every kind of invader
[SPEAKER_01]: but are also causing a lot of damage to
the host and so when we're saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds are targeting inflammation
it's not only bringing down redness and
[SPEAKER_01]: like swelling and it's also bringing down
pain and as most people know inflammation
[SPEAKER_01]: is an underlying mechanism for many many
different diseases so even if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: condition that there may be no cure for if
you can get the inflammation under control
[SPEAKER_01]: your symptoms will feel better so even
just targeting some of these pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna get I mean seemingly like oh
it does so many things is this actually
[SPEAKER_01]: real but all of these underlying
mechanisms play roles in many many
[SPEAKER_01]: different diseases so we can say something
like skin burns and hard tumors and fever
[SPEAKER_01]: may not seem like they're related but they
could all be a part of the same condition
[SPEAKER_01]: and so if you're targeting it's kind of
like pulling the string of the yarn ball
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you if you get the the
inflammatory processes under control the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole host will start just feeling better
and kind of the body will work better and
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to sort itself out even if we look
at something like modulating stress like
[SPEAKER_01]: so I work a lot with patients with
inflammatory bowel diseases so Crohn's and
[SPEAKER_01]: colitis and these are gastrointestinal
conditions that inflammation and pain play
[SPEAKER_01]: a big role but stress and psychological
just how you're feeling about your body
[SPEAKER_01]: plays a huge role in the disease and when
patients are in a state of stress and
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety their body doesn't work as well
and so it can't work as good and so even
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting that stress under control
sometimes that can help get the
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation under control and then all of
a sudden the patient starts getting less
[SPEAKER_01]: ulcers and so I think we have to even take
these like stress relief seems like such a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple thing but it's it's such a you know
an underlying mechanism for so many
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases that if we can get basic things
like stress inflammation just things that
[SPEAKER_01]: really affect everyone and have highs and
lows throughout the day but there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many nutritional and lifestyle factors we
can do including cannabis right on that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a lot of sense you know so often
when working with a cannabis patient we
[SPEAKER_00]: find out that yeah the cannabis helped
them but actually once they started
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeping properly they started getting
better just because they were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: proper sleep you know it's we got to take
care of these basic systems you know one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things I like about how your paper
is laid out is that you know at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning you go through an explanation of
you know that gives context and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different active compounds we're working
with but then you get to go section by
[SPEAKER_00]: section on the different ailments that you
can get relief from and before we move on
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we hit a couple
that we haven't hit so far because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we've talked about you know infection
and fever and gout but let's and the
[SPEAKER_00]: postpartum hemorrhaging but let's talk
about a sexually transmitted disease why
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you hit on that yeah so this again
we kind of hesitated to put this one in
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was one quote to it but it
was interesting and I have the paper here
[SPEAKER_01]: so I mean I'll read it a little bit but so
there was one report of cannabis root
[SPEAKER_01]: being used to help with gonorrhea so in
the 17th century a German born botanist
[SPEAKER_01]: employed by the Dutch East Indian Company
I think it's interesting to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: context of who these people were so anyway
he the quote says that the Moors took the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots of the male or the flower bearing
plant and they used it to feed and who
[SPEAKER_01]: those who were held fast unclean but with
gonorrhea I mean these quotes the wording
[SPEAKER_01]: is a little awkward the old English is
really a mess yeah yeah it is and so
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you're always like is that what
they meant so basically we took that from
[SPEAKER_01]: this account they were eating cannabis
root to help with gonorrhea but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really unclear from this account how it
was prepared so yeah we just had it in
[SPEAKER_01]: there as a quote saying this because I
feel like when we make and Ethan was
[SPEAKER_01]: really a good mentor for putting this
paper together because he was saying even
[SPEAKER_01]: these accounts that may you know have a
little comment about it's our
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to put it together so if
someone does decide to research that
[SPEAKER_01]: further it's like hey that there was an
account of that and someone was using that
[SPEAKER_01]: and as we know what the cannabis plant it
does so many different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes there's this condition that's
seemingly out there that you're like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: does it do that and then you find out that
it actually can help with that condition
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah it was a interesting quote that
came up so we decided to include it well I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that this paper really does open a
lot of doors right because it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the final word on any of this what
you're really doing is opening a door to
[SPEAKER_00]: new directions in research by giving you
know historical survey of how you know
[SPEAKER_00]: older cultures have used the root ball for
for a wide range of things and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the great things about the
paper another one I want to hit on is the
[SPEAKER_00]: GI tract because you know we all know that
cannabis is used by an anti-mimetic you
[SPEAKER_00]: know to stop people from vomiting but also
you're you're suggesting that the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used as a you know essentially a
tummy tonic that would help a whole range
[SPEAKER_01]: of ailments yeah and it's interesting
because the accounts with the root bomb in
[SPEAKER_01]: or sorry the root ball in reference to
gastrointestinal activity is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being used to induce vomiting so yeah I'll
read a little bit the cannabis roots have
[SPEAKER_01]: been used to protect against vomiting but
also to induce vomiting so in Chile hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: roots have been used as a purgative and so
the way they were using it they were
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing it polarized with wine and
recommending it for weaknesses and pains
[SPEAKER_01]: of the stomach and so that's really
interesting to me again because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: more about how THC and CBD the
cannabinoids can affect the gut and play a
[SPEAKER_01]: big role especially in inflammation and in
helping with nausea and vomiting although
[SPEAKER_01]: we also know that there's a condition
called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome
[SPEAKER_01]: where some people respond badly to high
amounts of cannabis and it actually can
[SPEAKER_01]: induce vomiting so yeah I think this whole
system and the way cannabis can interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with our gastrointestinal system it's by
module so it can induce things and it can
[SPEAKER_01]: also suppress things and it's all dose
dependent and also dependent on the
[SPEAKER_01]: person's constitution so yeah I think it
there's more research that's needed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done but yeah it's interesting that the
roots also seem to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: gastrointestinal activity also I like that
word you just used by module that's a new
[SPEAKER_00]: one on me thank you for that so so one of
the things that that is curious is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the the survey of the research
talks about mostly about you know
[SPEAKER_00]: old-school healers but then you know the
the last section of the paper really
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on Friedelin and and it's kind of
like once removed right because people
[SPEAKER_00]: have not been doing organized studies on
root balls in modern time but Friedelin
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in the root ball there has been
research taking place and so under under
[SPEAKER_00]: that flag would you talk a little bit
about how Friedelin impacts both cardiac
[SPEAKER_01]: activity and estrogenic activity sure so
yeah with estrogenic activity this is
[SPEAKER_01]: still an area that more research is needed
but because there were the mentions of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis root being used orally during
pregnant or sorry during to help with
[SPEAKER_01]: childbirth and bleeding we were trying to
figure out some rationale why that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be and so we found a little bit of
evidence that Friedelin may have some
[SPEAKER_01]: estrogenic activity when it's been
isolated from other plants and this one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that's really rich in Friedelin
sorry while I butcher the name sissus
[SPEAKER_01]: quadragulus I'm not actually sure what
this plant is but it's an edible plant
[SPEAKER_01]: found in hotter parts of India and West
Africa and this plant is documented in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ayurveda for its medicinal use in gout
syphilis venereal disease and also as an
[SPEAKER_01]: aphrodisiac and it's really rich in
Friedelin and then there's also another
[SPEAKER_01]: plant where Friedelin was isolated and
they did some work with rat models who
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have their ovaries and they found
that the Friedelin section when they fed
[SPEAKER_01]: this to the animals and improved their
sexual behavior and they found that this
[SPEAKER_01]: was related to estrogen activity with an
increase in uterine weight and a rise in
[SPEAKER_01]: serum estrogen so again these are very
preliminary studies but it hints that
[SPEAKER_01]: there could be something more going on and
then the other one oh you brought up was
[SPEAKER_01]: the cardiac activity yeah so this again
was another place we had a bit of issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with because there is some confusion where
there was a report in the Journal of
[SPEAKER_01]: American Medical Association JAMA thinking
that the cannabis roots might be an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the way we spun it was throughout
history there's no mentions of any cardiac
[SPEAKER_01]: activity in cannabis roots but then
there's this 1971 report in the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: journal and so I'll just read what we
wrote it says in 1971 Roger published an
[SPEAKER_01]: account in JAMA recollecting his physician
uncle using Indian hemp roots to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: edema in 1931 and then this prompted an
investigation later on by this other
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher who infused cannabis roots with
whiskey into guinea pig hearts and what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens is the heart rates dropped from
240 to 60 so they're saying oh this caused
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart to go slower and so they were
kind of concerned about this and then but
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue is that we think or Ethan
thought anyway that Roger may this account
[SPEAKER_01]: from 1971 he may have mistaken the
cannabis root for Indian hemp which is
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant because this other plant
does have some heart related issues and so
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway the long story short we concluded
that this report was likely untrue and
[SPEAKER_01]: there actually is no actual toxicity of
cannabis roots and then again this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: confusion is avoidable by using proper
Latin names so again this stuff needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be clarified and more research needs to be
done and even making sure that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: no dangers but throughout history in the
quotes we didn't come across any mentions
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and heart issues so it's so
exciting though right because like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like we're finding another cannabis
plant like we love cannabis we love all
[SPEAKER_00]: the oils that we can get out of the
trichomes and we're just beginning the
[SPEAKER_00]: research on that and then all of a sudden
now we're talking about root balls with an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire different set of active compounds
and it's like oh wow look there's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what there's nine different sections in
the paper and it's like wow there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's tons of room for research in each
of the nine sections it just opens it up
[SPEAKER_00]: so so this is a call out to all you
citizen scientists out there to to get on
[SPEAKER_00]: it after the break we're gonna talk about
how to do some of these preparations with
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of instruction as we can pull out
of Natasha so stay with us we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take a short break and be right back
you're listening to shaping fire and my
[SPEAKER_00]: guest today is cannabis health researcher
Natasha Riz if you grow cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine you can often feel limited by the
seasonal cycle you want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably in save money so you use as
little electricity as possible but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't studied or implemented light
deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse you're leaving a lot of money
on the table by incorporating light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation solutions into your greenhouse
you can often add two or three additional
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cycles to your year when you
pencil out the financial benefit of those
[SPEAKER_00]: additional cycles you'll realize why
commercial scale light deprivation
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is remaking the cannabis
industry what used to be done by pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: tarps over hoop houses has been scaled up
over the last few years in such a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become mechanized easy and affordable
to even small-scale commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: operations forever flowering greenhouses
is the industry leader in light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation greenhouse design and
operation for the commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry their team of greenhouse experts
have been in the fields of northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California for decades and they're now
building greenhouses for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies across the country if
you are new to light depth and growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses I encourage you to go back to
shaping fire episode 13 with guest Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: Branstad of forever flowering I talk with
Eric about the importance of intelligent
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse management as well as the huge
financial benefit of incorporating light
[SPEAKER_00]: depth techniques there are so many aspects
of utilizing a greenhouse that can go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong from temperature and airflow to
light depth and workflow forever flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you produce crop after crop of
well cared for flowers they can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: retrofit your existing greenhouse with
light depth and other modern systems at a
[SPEAKER_00]: level that fits your budget if you're just
starting out forever flowering can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan and build your new greenhouse so
that you get started on the right foot the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business has enough risks without

in this week's newsletter welcome back
[SPEAKER_00]: you're listening to shaping fire and I'm
your host shango lows and our guest this
[SPEAKER_00]: week is cannabis health researcher Natasha
Riz so you know so far in the show we have
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about why the root ball is so
healthy and all the different ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: healers of all sorts have been using it
you know where they live over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know there's not really a lot of
information in the archives of how they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made the preparation so I know
that I'm going to be asking you questions
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha that you are probably haven't been
provided answers for but but you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: all know that that after growers are
hearing this show that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some experimentation with root balls
come this fall because you know who
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't and so I want to go through four
of the preparations that are talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: in your paper and just give me the best
you know the best information that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have gleaned and I understand that there's
going to be some some vacuum there and and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just tell people that to try it so
so here so here are a handful of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may not know the answer to so so
the the main one that I was attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: is the decoction by boiling and you know
the idea of boiling something that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: easy enough but but just generally I'm
curious from you you know when you boil it
[SPEAKER_00]: do you cut it up into slices first how
much water might I use how long might I
[SPEAKER_00]: boil it and then when I'm done do I want
to reduce the water so that the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished liquid agent is actually more
dense yeah those are all great questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and I am anticipating there's going to be
so many interesting concoctions coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: of different ways to prepare them so the
ways that we've tried is first off cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots is very difficult we had like
they're very hard and so I still haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out the best way to process them
into pieces so at this point in time we've
[SPEAKER_01]: just been breaking them as best we can
I've also heard someone suggests putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them in liquid nitrogen and then crushing
them that way would be a good way to try
[SPEAKER_01]: it but I haven't fun so that might be the
solution to that issue and then basically
[SPEAKER_01]: putting as much water and roots together I
mean the more the better to just you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to like even a one-to-one if it possible
and so again when you're making water
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions there's issues of microbial or
bacterial or mold growth because as soon
[SPEAKER_01]: as you have water in a compound the shelf
stability isn't as great so that's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reasons I haven't played as much with
the water extractions but I think if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to do a water extraction you
would want to like you said concentrate it
[SPEAKER_01]: down after and so that there was reports
of people doing that where they would take
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots in the water I mean chopped or
as chopped up as you could get them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then infusing that in the water and then
again what are the proper temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the proper timeline I can't give
much suggestion to that except the
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout history it was boiling so I'm
guessing it's going to be a heavier boil I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what the I'd have to look into
what the exact temperature time points for
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds like Fritoline and those things
to potentially be breaking down I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure what that is but and then you'd also
have to experiment with how long are you
[SPEAKER_01]: boiling it for because when a lot of
people make their even like their cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flower infusions in coconut oil or
something sometimes they're cooking that
[SPEAKER_01]: for a 30-minute infusion or they're doing
a three-day infusion right so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the length of infusion you're
going to do you're going to extract
[SPEAKER_01]: different compounds and again there's
water extractions there's fat extractions
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I haven't experimented with
alcohol extractions yet but I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a really nice way to bring out
both the fat and the water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds from the roots and then yeah I
think once you get either your root powder
[SPEAKER_01]: or your root extract or the water or the
fat extraction or you're boiling that down
[SPEAKER_01]: after you've done the water extraction to
get really like a gum tar resin then I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that will be your your compound that
you're then going to have to incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: into other bases so like your base cream
for instance and like when working with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids there's many different things
you have to consider when you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: making topicals and a big one is
absorption so with the fat soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids a lot of them stay in the
surface of the skin and that's why a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people like them is because they don't
go systemically but there's also
[SPEAKER_01]: permeation enhancers and compounds you can
add to your blends that can help boost
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption and maybe get some of these
compounds into your body and systemically
[SPEAKER_01]: so of course when you're making these hemp
or the cannabis root concoctions and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting them into your final blends
those are things you'll have to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: is do you want this blend to stay on the
surface of your skin or do you want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb into your skin and so that will
depend what kind of formulation you put
[SPEAKER_01]: and then again you're also going to have
to consider what kind of what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: target for this for this formula are you
is it for a sore is it for a burn is it
[SPEAKER_01]: for inflammation and pain is it for just
you know a hand cream because your hands
[SPEAKER_01]: are dry because then that will depend
again what kind of blend you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put together and how you're going to I
always like to think of who my end user is
[SPEAKER_01]: before I make a formula just because if
it's nice it smells good it absorbs good
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not for the right application no
one's going to use it so I think the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with the roots is there's many
different ways to prepare it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: again are you going to make like if you're
concerned about drug testing and having
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in these compounds the roots are nice
because they wouldn't test for THC or any
[SPEAKER_01]: of these other compounds so you might want
to just make your root blends alone or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want them to work even better I would
add the cannabis flowers in there too
[SPEAKER_01]: because of course the cannabinoids and THC
CBD those are going to make everything
[SPEAKER_01]: work a bit better for topicals especially
so yeah so we talked about that trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: think oh I think it's um I just realized
while you were talking that I'm gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a lab that actually tests for
Friedland because I bet you that my you
[SPEAKER_00]: know my local cannabis lab that's probably
not one that they're checking for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'm gonna have to check in with them
and find somewhere because now I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm I'm devising these little
citizen science tests that I want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: myself this fall with the root balls and I
bet you that I'm not going to be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: one so let's let's talk about poultests a
little bit so we got the decoction by
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling pretty clearly you know poultice I
think the only time I ever actually come
[SPEAKER_00]: across that anymore is like in like
survival movies you know where you know
[SPEAKER_00]: some some ancient you know Yoda healer you
know take some some you know moss or
[SPEAKER_00]: something off the ground and then they
clittered against us and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: magically healed in the next scene you
know so but but you know how would you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make a poultice out of the the
root ball so a poultice is basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: like a mash of herbs that you're putting
together in something like like
[SPEAKER_01]: cheesecloth or one of those like even just
like a tablecloth like a cloth that the
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid can then permeate through and so it
would be similar to how you're doing like
[SPEAKER_01]: even what you could do is you could put a
root mass in there and kind of close it
[SPEAKER_01]: off in like dishcloth tie it up at the top
and then you could like boil that in water
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that poultice you could then
remove it kind of squeeze out the excess
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put it on topically so that would
be more for like spot treatments like say
[SPEAKER_01]: you had a rolled ankle or your knee was
hurting or you had a wound somewhere then
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd want like and a poultice isn't
necessarily the most it's the word like
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient because it's a big mass of
plant you're in this concoction that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to hold on to your thing so it's more
of a home treatment I guess but what's
[SPEAKER_01]: cool about again with the poultice you can
combine other herbs and other plants so
[SPEAKER_01]: again what you're and who your end user is
and what the condition is will depend on
[SPEAKER_01]: what herbs and what plants you put
together when you make your poultice it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like one of the common issues
amongst all of these is just breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: the root right to get it to you know to to
either cut it or mash it or or put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cheese grater or whatever you're going
to do getting it small into smaller pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be the the challenge that the
next one that's in the paper is pulverized
[SPEAKER_00]: and mixed with wine so tell us a little
bit about how that would look yeah so I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't experimented with that one at all
but I'm guessing it would be similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting and again we could talk about are
we talking about older root are we talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about younger root because I think there's
another whole spectrum of playing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and trying to figure out different
medical applications because if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using an early root I mean we'd have to
look at how these different compounds are
[SPEAKER_01]: developing because they're not even really
saying in the papers like how old the root
[SPEAKER_01]: was when it was analyzed so if we were
using younger root it would be easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: break up and mash and make some of these
concoctions but maybe it doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds you're looking for whereas the
older root might be harder to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: but might have a different profile of
compounds so again those types of analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be done and alcohol why would be a
nice extraction base is because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: bring out all the fat soluble and the
water soluble compounds and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the risk of microbial like bacteria
or mold growth to the same extent that
[SPEAKER_01]: just water does so you can get some better
shelf stability if you're using alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: versus water and wine generally just makes
everything better so yeah especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bitter medicine so the last one is raw
juice and I was just imagining if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to struggle for what to break it
down what a cannabis root ball would do to
[SPEAKER_00]: my macerating juice or god help us but it
seems to me that maybe an apple crusher
[SPEAKER_00]: would might be more the appropriate tool
for the job than something in the kitchen
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah when I saw the juice I was I was same
thing like how I don't put that in your
[SPEAKER_01]: juicer yeah so again I'm wondering if
they're using younger roots because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got some more give to them versus
the older roots which would I mean I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think they were using juicers back in the
ancient days maybe though but yeah that
[SPEAKER_01]: one I haven't played with at all so that's
readers please give me your her listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: please let me know how that one goes yeah
totally I think that's one of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: things about both your paper and the show
today is really this is not a show about
[SPEAKER_00]: having all the answers this is about this
is a show about all the new questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really exciting thanks so
much for joining me on the show today
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha this is really groundbreaking work
and I bet you there's a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are listening who are as excited to play
with root balls as I am now yeah and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited to hear about all these
experiments and I'm excited to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: people come up with some new treatments
and always harnessing the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to help us right on so so if you want to
