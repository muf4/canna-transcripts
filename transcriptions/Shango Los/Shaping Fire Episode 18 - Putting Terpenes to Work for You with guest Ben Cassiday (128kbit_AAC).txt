[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis smells really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us buy cannabis based on its
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We unscrew the mason jar, stick our nose
in there, and take a mighty whiff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body tells you if you want that
strain or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: During episode 11, we spent a lot of time
talking about cannabis terpenes with
[SPEAKER_01]: world-famous neurologist and cannabis
researcher Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He explained how THC, CBD, and the other
cannabinoids work in cooperation with
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes in the plant in what's called the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are the plant's aromatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are why cannabis smells so good,
whether it's pine, or chocolate,
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus, or skunk, or any of the other
aromas of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the essential aspects of healing
with cannabis simply is its smell.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Ben Cassaday,
co-founder of True Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk with Ben about
cannabis aromatics and aromatherapy,
[SPEAKER_01]: how terpenes are isolated for sale,
and how you can use terpenes even without
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for everyday healing and quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right to it and talk about where
terpenes come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know where they come from in nature,
but how are isolated terpenes extracted or
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things about that
question, and I think it's probably once
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody gets over the idea or starts to
understand what is a terpene, then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately like, well, how do you get
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the ones that I get asked the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to initially say to people is,
you're actually probably a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with isolated terpenes than you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just start with saying that terpenes
are separated from plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically through two different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is vacuum distillation,
and one of them is steam distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you can use steam distillation
in a vacuum distillation setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give a rough preliminary
description of vacuum distillation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's where we're removing the atmosphere,
a lot of people are starting to see these
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy glassware setups for short path
distillation and other high-level
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that the actual purpose for
these distillation setups has been more
[SPEAKER_00]: tailored towards the essential oil
industries for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the same technology that's
been around for a while to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes with vacuum, which means,
like I said, we remove the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you remove the atmosphere,
you're basically making it easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: things to boil off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to fight the vapor
pressure for them to become active in an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum distillation is great because it
allows you to use a very little amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and a little amount of heat,
which means the molecule doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: distorted or destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steam distillation is a little bit more
widely used, but it allows some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, some of the terpenes,
to change in state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily just like they
were in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steam distillation allows for larger batch
sizes and a little bit less sophistication
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum distillation allows for very,
very precise and gentle extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's a process of taking raw plant
material, turning it into an essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, and then taking that essential oil
and slowly boiling all of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: components out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm not hearing any of that is
any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the two processes you've
described so far are actually pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different industrial applications
or distillation procedures that somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: might take plant material and they might
use a solvent under vacuum distillation or
[SPEAKER_00]: steam distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, when we're working with food
grade and sometimes above that grade
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals that people are going to be
ingesting or using in fragrances and other
[SPEAKER_00]: related fields, it's always been a really
important thing in our line of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: personally with our company, to make sure
that there hasn't been any solvents used
[SPEAKER_00]: in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's a good example, I want to talk
briefly about the bad example.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of weeks ago, we had Dr. Ethan
Russo on the show talking about terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and cannabinoids in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: He surprised me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that some terpenes are coming from
petroleum refinement and it's a byproduct
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what they would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a little background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, after listening to that episode
when it went live, which I just have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say is maybe one of my favorite podcasts
of all time, not just because I'm on your
[SPEAKER_00]: show at this moment, but really just went
in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inspired me to look a little bit more
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few ideas, but I wasn't really
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are starting to hear at
this point, especially when I go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to people, people have heard
cannabis might have 200 terpenes and that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 30 or 40,000 in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very diverse class of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say that something is a terpene,
it's not a small class of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to necessarily find the
same terpenes in cannabis that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be getting from these industrial
sources, petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked into it, what I was able to
find is people are distilling,
[SPEAKER_00]: and industry has not really people,
but industry has been distilling petroleum
[SPEAKER_00]: for things like mineral spirits,
kerosene, naphtha.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as being a hydrocarbon molecule,
they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from my best guess without having
reached out to Dr. Russo to confirm based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what he was saying, I think that we can
assume that any carbon-based organic
[SPEAKER_00]: substance that is made of isoprene,
which is the building block of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be considered a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just such a wide diverse
class of chemicals that yes, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them can be derived from all sorts
of organic materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, we don't really think of
mineral spirits or kerosene, gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems so chemical in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really seem like it's an
organic product, but it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's derived from crude oil and through
distillation processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my best guess at this point
without being able to speak with him
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that we're getting delimiting
from citrus fruit and also from petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specific set of uncommon terpenes
that we would get from petroleum
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would even say those might be some of
the most prevalent terpenes on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of how much crude oil is
actually distilled and then the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: uses for kerosene and naphtha and other
solvents of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the ones that we're all,
at least in this community, quite
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, from my knowledge so far,
I don't think you really need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned that it came out of gasoline or
crude oil producing gasoline for your
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha pionene or your mircene or linalool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, uncool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then that makes a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though there are truly trashy
terpenes, they're not really the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: we work with in our sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's focus on ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the grades of terpenes
because one thing I have certainly read
[SPEAKER_01]: people fighting about quality of terpenes
on Facebook and different forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know how ugly and inaccurate a lot
of those debates are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go through a couple different
standards that can be used to grade a
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks who are selling
terpenes, they really push that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean to me as a purchaser,
as a consumer of terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as food grade goes, that really
just means that the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration has placed this substance
on the approved food additives list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our company really focuses on only selling
terpenes that are found within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happens that we haven't ran
into a terpene that was found in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that also was not found on the Food and
Drug Administration's list of approved
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, all of the terpenes that
we're working with are food grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: GRAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: GRAS stands for Generally Recognized as
Safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that it's free range and
you can just bathe in the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that under the right
circumstances with proper product
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation that this can be used in a
cosmetic product or a nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: product or a food product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the organic part, that probably
refers to whatever your source plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material was raised without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely does if it's got a third
party certification on it for being
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have the statement pulled up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an FDA statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, terpenes are by definition an
organic molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't exist outside of being organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA actually allows all terpenes that
are not synthetically derived to be listed
[SPEAKER_00]: as an organic substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in isolation, again, it's a
carbon-containing molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like those of us who are nerds for
organic food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would call that little-o organic,
meaning it's about it being a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: source, not necessarily whether or not it
uses pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, which kind of brings me to the
point that I usually bring around with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is that what's most important,
I think, with terpenes is looking at what
[SPEAKER_00]: else is in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult, almost impossible to
get a 100% terpene solution or even a 99.9
[SPEAKER_00]: in most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to really look at what is in that
other percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really becomes what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the terpenes are very similar by
chemical nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have almost the exact molecular
weight of one another under the right
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of the plant, they can actually
turn from one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for limonene,
alpha-pionene, and myrcene, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: to phase shift between each other,
given their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have a bottle of 99.9% limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that it's contaminated
with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really might mean that that final
fraction in there was some myrcene and
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha-pionene that just could not be
separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I like to always bring
it back around to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as these terpenes go, a terpene is
organic, but the package that it comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other substances in the solution
is what we really need to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this industry, do we really care
whether or not the original plant was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown GMO or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that we want to be aware
of when we're making purchases?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have such a diverse crowd of
people that are consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to make sure that
people are aware beforehand that it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from whatever they're consuming came from
non-GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, personally, I come from the camp
that I think that we should investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that it's something to be
shunned, but I also think that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: should be notified of what they're
consuming and people should have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to opt out if they're not
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that applies to food and I think
it applies to cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings us up to what is probably the
most discussed and possibly controversial
[SPEAKER_01]: part of what is and is not a terpene
because terpenes got really hot and
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting in being able to extract
cannabis profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I saw this being done was
at the Emerald Cup in, let's see,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would have been 2015 Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Verzura from United Cannabis had all
these people around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks were bringing him up what was
otherwise mediocre slabs of shatter and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was taking cannabis profile terpenes and
painting the dab oil and then the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: would go and dab and they're like,
oh, this is the best gorilla glue I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were adding terpenes after the fact
and people were going bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite impressive to see everyone's
excitement about taking mediocre cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product and supercharging it with a
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I got into that, I realized how
controversial it was about whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: different cannabis companies were either
A, taking actual cannabis flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: distilling from that to get the actual
terpenes that were in a batch of flower or
[SPEAKER_01]: B, doing research to find out what
terpenes were in, say for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla glue and then hand blending food
grade terpenes to emulate what the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile would have been if you would have
taken them directly out of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, people will fight all day long on
social media about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you break it down for us the
differences between those two approaches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I first would just start by saying
my same opinion about the GMO substance
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that isolated terpenes,
we don't have the entire catalog of 200
[SPEAKER_00]: available to us at this point and there's
a couple of different reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are incredibly difficult to
have in isolation and that's because they
[SPEAKER_00]: might have a boiling point around room
temperature or 80 degrees or so which is
[SPEAKER_00]: why when you're in a hot grow room,
it really just smells something special
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're never really going to be able
to recreate that or fully capture it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live resins and other extractions are
doing a pretty good job of capturing as
[SPEAKER_00]: much terpene as possible but at the end of
the day, there are some of these compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not easily isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that leads to is the terpenes that we
actually have at our disposal to add back
[SPEAKER_00]: are primarily the heaviest, most stable
molecules, the mono and sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were imagining, let's say you
started with a Gorilla Glue 4 just to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow your example and you took that into
the testing lab that we prefer to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: time, SC Labs, and they gave you the
terpene analysis back which at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: they count for 34 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to tell you the natural ratio
that the terpenes that they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: test for are found in that plant and then
there's one other special number on that
[SPEAKER_00]: page and it's the total content by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see all these different
ratios and it's 34 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see alpha pionene at 3% and beta
pionene at 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be listed out in either
percentages or by milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom, it's going to say but
the total content of that entire gram was
[SPEAKER_00]: 4% or 7% or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to vary depending on if it was
a flower sample, if it was grown indoor or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor or if it was a concentrate and how
it was extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really important to look at is if
you're looking to emulate cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, you're going to want to only
add back those mono and sesquiterpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just keep it easy, say those 34
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to look at what does
the plant naturally produce at its best
[SPEAKER_00]: case scenario, fresh off the plant before
any sort of degradation has happened or
[SPEAKER_00]: mishandling and then try to emulate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just slopping it on and assuming that
more is going to be better but really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of precisely, maybe even take measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we'll follow your example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say a slab of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running a terpene test on that and seeing
where it is right now currently as kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a blank canvas without any additives to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's say you get an A plus top shelf
concentrate that you really admire from
[SPEAKER_00]: another source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else did some live resin and you
have some standard BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at the terpene content of
that live resin and compare it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene content of your BHO and you could
spike all of the individual mono and
[SPEAKER_00]: sesquiterpenes with terpenes to make it
more like the A plus medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you saw Tony doing was because the
product he's working with is supposedly
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis derived terpenes, it's taking
those natural ratios in the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution and adding it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature already did all the heavy lifting
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am a fan of those sorts of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the only reason that I'm in
the business that I am right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're very cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 15 to 20 times more by the
time that you get to the consumer level of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody buying a milliliter next to a
milliliter, cannabis derived first
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated plant derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also a little bit less shelf
stable and a little bit more inconsistent
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to continue to grow that crop
of cannabis under the same conditions to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the same flower to then be
distilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of new kind of tech coming into
play and people haven't been isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a not as much
available as far as source material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only grow so many plants most
places in this world and then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide what you're going to do with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not convinced personally that
distilling cannabis derived terpenes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is necessarily the best use for
really good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get back to comparing apples to apples,
I think limonene from an orange and
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene from cannabis, they're chemically
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true of all terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones that I think people might
be familiar with are linalool from
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender and myrcine from hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think ultimately it comes down to
is the importance of purity in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have five milliliters of limonene,
you want that to be as close to as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible as pure limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dealing with a distillation like
what we work in, achieving those super
[SPEAKER_00]: high percentage purities is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shoot to have everything above 96% but
then the other side of that coin is making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the other 4% that's remaining is
not pesticides, solvents or other degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that a lot of people might not
be familiar to hearing is that chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: like acetone or a couple of other known
solvents can be produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of plant material of other
natural organic material as UV and time
[SPEAKER_00]: play their course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was a little bit of a
roundabout so I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I think as far as source comes
and maybe you could actually return to the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing it back to the cannabis strain
profiles part and you answered my question
[SPEAKER_01]: really well explaining the difference
between the cannabis derived and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: food derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what it occurred to me is
that when you describe how cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: derived is going to be 15 to 20% more,
not 20, 15 to 20 times more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that made me think of, I've seen a
handful of terpene companies and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: the prices they charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these folks that kind of write
their copy to suggest that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: derived, their profiles are extracted from
cannabis, they just can't be doing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: the price that they're selling it at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds to me like some companies
are probably being a little creative with
[SPEAKER_01]: their copywriting because it's so much
cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: People generally think it's cooler to take
your terpenes directly from the flower but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so cost prohibitive that maybe
they're writing their copy to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: suggest that in an abstract way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when push comes to shove, they're
actually pulling terpenes from food plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and then just doing their absolute best to
make a blend that matches the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile that they got out of the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I mean, I guess to start off to
say, we really made it our, we took a
[SPEAKER_00]: position early on because everything that
you just said was our thoughts that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had and that our company has had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we took a position early on to not try
to police the industry just because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much to focus on within the
organization that what people are doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside, I just don't have a crystal
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I will say is that I think it's
not, I think part of what you said with
[SPEAKER_00]: people, the copy, I think people are
getting pretty creative with their copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my experience, I've bought
from several of the companies that suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's cannabis derived and what it
really appears to me is something along
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines of like a cold trapped cannabis
terpene from a vacuum oven or maybe even a
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled batch combined with isolated
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't a new practice by any
means, you know, the essential oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: perfume industry since I think probably
its inception or very shortly thereafter
[SPEAKER_00]: has been plagued with companies that will
take lesser at lesser oils and cut more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive oils to make them stretch
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it's a practice that in
one way or another is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, like I said, we never really
wanted to police the industry and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: never been embarrassed that we sell plant
drive terpenes so we've just always made
[SPEAKER_00]: it blatantly obvious that these are from
other sources and tried to give people the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to decide if working with us is
within their, you know, kind of within
[SPEAKER_00]: their guiding principles for what their
business is trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no reason for you to police the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things about having
both a free and open market and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, if somebody is selling schlock,
the word's gonna get around and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better to focus on your own startup
company and your own science and go from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're kind of late for our
first break so we're gonna get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anybody who's been listening to the
first set here and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, they're kind of leaning on the
manufacturing and science part a little
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy, do not fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set two is gonna be all about how to use
terpenes in everyday life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please stay for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Shango Los and my guest today is Ben
Cassaday, co-founder of True Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who is paying attention to
cannabis medicine, it has become
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly apparent that full extract
cannabis oil, known to some as Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil, is the cornerstone of healing
humans with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a medical dispensary or retail
store, you know that your customers are
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have been working with patients
and seeking out quality full extract oil
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Pacific Northwest, you know the
provider deep green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kat Jeter and her team at deep green had
been making full extract cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting the standards for quality and
exact dosing for years in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deep green brand is known by patients
and cannabis media as a premium quality
[SPEAKER_01]: provider for sick children, cancer
patients, and others in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time when there are no national
standards for cannabis oil, ensuring a
[SPEAKER_01]: product is whole plant, quality assured,
and lab tested is often a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing your source is reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust and equality brand is essential in
choosing a cannabis medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be used concentrated and in volume by
any patient and especially those with
[SPEAKER_01]: weakened immune systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep green is looking for national brand
partners to expand the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: their legacy top shelf cannabis oil to
emerging medical and licensed states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners benefit from the deep green brand
recognition and credibility, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing customer and marketing support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but deep green knows how to
employ the 280e tax rule so you can deduct
[SPEAKER_01]: it all from your taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with deep green can provide the
trust and authenticity too often pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: aside in favor of lifestyle products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your customers can assure themselves that
regardless of the state in which it is
[SPEAKER_01]: made, brand licensees adhere to the same
strict standards that patients everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: have come to expect from deep green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep green licensing includes startup and
capital planning as well as operational
[SPEAKER_01]: and manufacturing instruction as you'd
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information on how your company,
co-op, or medical dispensary can benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from partnering with deep green to provide
full extract cannabis oil to patients,

green to connect with Kat Jeter and her
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shapingfire.com forward slash deep
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Ben Cassaday, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: True Turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the first set, we were talking all
about how isolated turpines are extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: or manufactured and the differences
between turpines that come from raw
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis versus come from plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really interesting for people
who are nerdy about the science part,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm sure there's people who are
listening who are like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what turpines are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I use them in my everyday life?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna start with the example that
is actually how I met you, Ben,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what really impacted me and how I knew
I wanted to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This past year in December, I was down at
Emerald Cup and Ben was part of a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis owners and I, and we all rented
this wine villa, so we could all stay
[SPEAKER_01]: together and it was really great,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all these cannabis business owners
were all learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point, Ben went around the room
and he gave everybody just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-karyophylline in their hands and
encouraged them to cup their hands and
[SPEAKER_01]: inhale deeply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had never done that before and
beta-karyophylline just smelled so good
[SPEAKER_01]: and it made me feel so calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me realize that even though up
to this point, all of my care about
[SPEAKER_01]: turpines was really what was in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really thought about using the
turpines independently from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really thought about using this
for quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since that time, I've gotten an
ultrasonic turpine diffuser and you showed
[SPEAKER_01]: me how to dab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go through some of those ways
that people can use turpines at home
[SPEAKER_01]: without actually burning or vaping some
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just like you were saying,
the first and I think maybe easiest is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, is through the process of what
you've called hand-toughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna just first start by saying what I
actually had everybody try at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup was beta-karyophylline, but I had
mixed it one-to-one with just some extra
[SPEAKER_00]: virgin olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's just an important
note to start off with for anybody at home
[SPEAKER_00]: that might wanna try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we wanna make sure just like
any other essential oil that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it with a carrier oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're an aromatherapist or an
expert that's been using these for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time, I think you can always
assume that you should probably cut them
[SPEAKER_00]: with something because they are very just
kind of powerful chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every one of them, many of them
act as solvents in high purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanna start with that and say,
make sure that you're being safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing good aromatherapy practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with hand-toughing, the reason I really
wanted everybody to apply the
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-karyophylline to their hands was kind
of two-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the most relaxing and
calming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our particular mix is derived from a
combination of black pepper and clove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it very much resembles both of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spicy and earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just when you come into contact
with it, it's immediately everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you've just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relaxing and it's really,
in my opinion, people have heard chew on
[SPEAKER_00]: black peppercorns if you're too high or
something of those nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that beta-karyophylline is so
interesting for that purpose because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not overly stimulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in your face too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the more benign terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that I mean that you can be around
a lot of it before you start to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get to an intoxicated level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas there's some terpenes like,
let's say, geraniol, which is the main
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene in roses and geraniums,
which really can start to have an effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on you very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start with
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps people get their hands terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we move from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second reason why, it's a good
learning tool and nobody's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt from it in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason being is it's a topical
anesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the other reason why I
really like to introduce it to people is
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody at one time or another
in their life, or most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: have had the opportunity to have a sore
muscle or something along the lines where
[SPEAKER_00]: they rubbed a cream on and were expecting
some sort of relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's obviously varying degrees of
success with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those, like vicks vapor rub,
for instance, actually are containing
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the hand-toughing, I just want to
always encourage people to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using an olive oil or a coconut
oil, sweet almond oil, you can get on
[SPEAKER_00]: Google and look around for aromatherapy
carriers and you'll find a list of 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main ones that I really like to do
that with are the primary ones from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's just because I'm so
familiar with them and I kind of know what
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect when working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So should we go down that road or would
you like to go into other methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's go into other methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you recommended to me an ultrasonic
diffuser, which I picked up and I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go ahead and explain that
and why it's making my room smell so good
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's actually probably the way
that I consume the most terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody within our company is the
ultrasonic diffuser, which basically is
[SPEAKER_00]: just using a small amount of water and a
vibrating sound wave to make the particles
[SPEAKER_00]: of the essential oil and water into
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can be puffed up into the air
and naturally breathed in in lower
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas we're getting a direct
inhalation of the extract when it's in our
[SPEAKER_00]: hands, we're kind of filling the room
ambiantly with terpenes when we use an
[SPEAKER_00]: ultrasonic diffuser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, like I said, I feel like it is
a little bit more natural because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting kind of a diluted, it's combined
with oxygen and we're breathing it over a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, start my day every single
day in my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I close the door and I kick it on and I
put some limonene and citriol in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: both citrus derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really just seems to be kind of
like Ethan had alluded to in his episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: very sunny and bright and alertive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of the way that I'll
start my day if I'm sick or thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use alpha pionene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha pionene acts as a bronchial dilator
and anybody that's had interaction with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I think will testify that it kind of
opens the lungs and makes it just much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you had mentioned earlier,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly, I think, therapeutically
active, but it's not going to give you any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of chance to inhale something that's
too potent or too strong and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to scent your hands or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very easy to set in the corner
of the room and let it run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one of my favorite reactions to
kind of take note of is the before and
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that's never used one before and
a lot of people have differing opinions on
[SPEAKER_00]: how aromatherapy works and what it is,
but I just like to let it speak for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have somebody sit down in a room and
start a conversation and let the diffuser
[SPEAKER_00]: run for a few minutes and then to watch
the face change as they realize that they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel different than four or five minutes
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really love the aromatherapy
diffuser and that's what I would generally
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to anybody that's starting to
get into terpenes and having interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's low impact, it's pretty
cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes will last a long time in it and
it really gives you the ability to start
[SPEAKER_00]: to investigate them and then once you
start to learn more about other ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing and consuming them, then you can
kind of move on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I found really easy
too is while there were really nice ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that were 200 bucks, I got mine for 50
bucks on Amazon and all I did was search
[SPEAKER_01]: ultrasonic diffuser and then there were
all these different ones that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: choose from and yeah, there are cooler
ones that I can upgrade to, but I'm up and
[SPEAKER_01]: going for 50 bucks and not only that,
but I like that it's a way to share
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes with other folks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have people over for a dinner party
or a little get together or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll fill the room and people always
comment on the smells and that always gets
[SPEAKER_01]: me talking about terpenes and then turns
into a little education thing sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: which I obviously am into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go to the commercial,
let's talk about dabbing terpenes by
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me a really great experience when
we were down there in California and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like you to describe it for other folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sake of everybody else in our
organization who isn't a huge fan of me
[SPEAKER_00]: always showing that off, but I just think
running into people like yourself who are
[SPEAKER_00]: so passionate about it and willing to
experience it, we had actually inhaled a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small amount of alpha-pinene for the
effect of opening our lungs and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say that the company that I'm with
does not really endorse that practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really suggest that people use terpenes
for topical and oral administration at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk about it, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we had done is we had
taken a vape battery mod, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I had particularly went from
5 to 40 watts and we put a ceramic nail on
[SPEAKER_00]: it that had a to-go water pipe attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically had taken just about a third
of a drop, which I usually measure out
[SPEAKER_00]: with a toothpick or something of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had dipped down into the alpha-pinene,
taken the drop and put it on the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is really important too,
whereas when people are dabbing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, they generally already have
the nail at the temperature that they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like it to be at, which then they go in
and they inhale it and it all vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really found the right
temperature for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's worked really well for me is
starting with a cold nail, adding the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene and then allowing it to come up to
temperature with the nail and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizes at exactly the right point as
soon as it's hit the temperature where it
[SPEAKER_00]: does vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's a much less violent
reaction, whereas as an experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, not a suggestion, but as an
experiment, if you wanted to just drop a
[SPEAKER_00]: drop of terpene on a 600 degree nail or
something, you would see it dance around
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just poof off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that rapid expansion would
happen and that's what would lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody having a really poor experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most terpenes and not all terpenes can be
just inhaled directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wouldn't suggest just going
through a whole catalog of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of what we did, like I said,
it was just a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha-pinene and the physical response is
so dramatic afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely feel the ease of taking
oxygen into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think personally, a mental clarity or
alertness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily the same thing as
after your first dab of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit still even more clear
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope to develop a product around
alpha-pinene if we're able to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the right channels as far as FDA approval,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because something is gross rated or
food safe doesn't mean that you can put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a product and inhale it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny when you mention putting the
terp right on a hot e-nail or something
[SPEAKER_01]: and having it dance around.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I definitely don't want to hit that
because of potential terpene toxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do that at home just as a visual
experiment and not actually hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, how can I do this on the
go?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these new portable dab rigs that
are based on batteries and those seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: go really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the one I've got from Vuber
Technologies, I put a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene there on the nail and then I just
let it start coming up to temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as it comes up to temp, I can hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, when you gave me the pinene to try
for the first time, I have asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that my lungs opened up and I
could breathe and I felt the power that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from being in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan and I were talking about that,
going out into the forest and taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: forest bath because it makes you feel like
you want to throw your shoulders back and
[SPEAKER_01]: put your chin up and you are full of power
and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just taking a little bit of pinene will do
that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly, I've worked my way through all the
terpenes I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between doing
that with pinene or myrsine or linalool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do each have their own
caricature or character.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I would say if somebody
really was interested in figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones are of greater interest for
that is look at a terpene analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: just look at the ratios that they're found
naturally in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha pinene is found in pretty high
levels, myrsine is found in pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, but other terpenes, again,
I'll bring up geraniol or maybe linalool,
[SPEAKER_00]: much smaller quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the amount that's in there,
they're very potent, but just using that
[SPEAKER_00]: logic as a rule of thumb for how much you
might want to consume of any one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: has led me pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go and take another short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Ben Cassaday, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: True Terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know though that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_01]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whizz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_01]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Ben Cassaday,
co-founder of True Turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Ben, it's very common now
for cannabis product developers to spike
[SPEAKER_01]: their products with turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll go ahead and process it
however they're going to, but if they want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be relaxing, maybe they'll add some
linalool or Miracene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they want it to pick you up,
they'll add some, you know, commonly known
[SPEAKER_01]: as Sativa Turpines like Citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I know you have got a lot
to say about that, but why don't you
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesize that a little bit down and just
give us your thoughts for product
[SPEAKER_01]: developers, you know, on turp stability
and degradation and homogenization and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, just like I had said before,
I think spiking with turpines is an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think there also should be you
should disclose that you've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we encourage all of our
clients to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage, we give them artwork from
our company that we encourage them to
[SPEAKER_00]: co-brand with so that if they have
questions, that those questions can be
[SPEAKER_00]: directed to us so that we can properly
answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think if you're getting into
it, it's just all about making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: people know what they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be surprised, you know,
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ability to influence a product
especially like I think I've had the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest success with like with tinctures
and topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an incredible blend that we put
into and call an indica blend tincture in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Oregon market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, we have Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been great and we wouldn't really
be able to do it without the control of
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated turpines because it's a
standardized recipe from batch to batch to
[SPEAKER_00]: batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything comes out identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's a definite pro if
you're working with products, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: distillates or isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolated CBD or distilled THC are two very
kind of more common cannabinoids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely becoming commercially viable
for people to use in making products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combining those with turpines so that you
can control the outcome of the product is
[SPEAKER_00]: really rewarding and can be lucrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll say about the stability is
that isolated turpines I'm told by several
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people that we've consulted with
from, you know, PhD chemistry world are
[SPEAKER_00]: much more stable because there's less
chemistry basically able to happen within
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle of turpines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you had a cannabis derived
profile of turpines from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from an OG Kush or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have 70 turpines in there that
are slowly degrading with UV and with time
[SPEAKER_00]: and with, you know, if they're not,
you know, kept at room temperature versus
[SPEAKER_00]: under some sort of colder conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they definitely have the opportunity to
degrade where when you have this isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical, you can more readily prepare for
how it's going to degrade and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can put a shelf life on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with these unknown solutions that are
different from batch to batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going with a complex profile,
it's a little bit harder to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So isolated turpines, I'm told and,
you know, from our experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: are much more stable, but all organic
things degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as homogenization, you know,
they, turpines are non-polar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need to, we need to make sure that
they are mixed into the right carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about any oil or fat based carrier is
going to work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest, I think healthiest that I'm
aware of personally is MCT.
[SPEAKER_00]: MCT works really great with turpines.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody that's first getting into it
right now, I think making like a
[SPEAKER_00]: home-based MCT tincture with or without
cannabinoids is a really good way to start
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing these in a relatively safe
manner, as long as you're doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: research on concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really encourage people to do
when they're starting to get into product
[SPEAKER_00]: development with turpines is walk before
you crawl, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many of them, you know,
they say up to 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time we offer 31 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about, we're going to expand that
even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking on so many different turpines,
it really just gives you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 31 more, if you bought our whole set,
you'd have 31 more variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really encourage people to get used
to kind of the core eight, the turpines
[SPEAKER_00]: that are high, found in the highest
quantities and kind of define unique
[SPEAKER_00]: branches of the cannabis family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to briefly go through those,
that's alpha-pinene, linalool,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-cariophylline, eucalyptol,
limonene, myrcine, turpinoline,
[SPEAKER_00]: and geraniol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all can be tied to common essential
oils as well that most people are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really encourage people to look into
aromatherapy and find the ways that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that contain these turpines,
the way that their essential oils are used
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, and then kind of start to mimic
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find some that are more prevalent
in topical applications and others that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used and consumed orally or some that
are never consumed but are used ambiantly
[SPEAKER_00]: and inhaled through the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just really, you know, for somebody
getting into this, it's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like another, it's not just a new form of
cannabis extract where you can throw it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the nail and inhale it and you're just
comparing the difference between a CO2 oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and a DHO or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are definitely highly, highly potent
therapeutic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, you know, I always invite
people to do their homework, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely pay for a consultation with a
company that works with these regularly or
[SPEAKER_00]: with an organic chemist to just get your
bearings down because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for as much as everybody wants them to be
therapeutic, you know, with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side of the coin is that they
can, you know, they can have dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that you may or may not be so
satisfied with if used improperly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that,
you know, I've got a lot of respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: product developers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've dabbled it in myself, mostly enough
to realize how challenging it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to put something together
that works right then and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as soon as you add, you know,
degradation, homogenization, shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: stability, and some kind of product
liability if the wrong kind of person gets
[SPEAKER_01]: what you've made, I realize what a craft
product development is and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding, you know, spiking with terpenes to
it, it adds a whole nother level to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, artisan to the craft because I
would say that people who are adding
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to their products, the ones who
are doing it really well aren't just
[SPEAKER_01]: spiking the hell out of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually crafting, you know,
several of them together for a desired
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and that is challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just totally up and beyond what the
rest of the soda or the edible or the
[SPEAKER_01]: capsule is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whole nother level of
expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the other thing with these
being highly volatile, meaning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they evaporate easily,
being very volatile scent molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: they also have a very strong flavor on the
palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, bringing them into a product
is not necessarily just as easy as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking your current existing
recipe and adding some terpenes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the entire recipe kind of needs
to be analyzed to make sure not only that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to ruin the flavor or
grossly manipulate the flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that it's not going to, like you said,
kind of like the shelf stability side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like three months down the road
that it's not going to separate or that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some sort of discoloration or
something along those lines happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it really is something to kind of
integrate into a product and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we usually recommend that people
give it like an 8 to 12 week shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stability test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are laboratories that you can work
with within the food and cosmetic
[SPEAKER_00]: industries that can do some simulated
testing to kind of help you get some more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do about a week's worth of
microbial testing and then build upon that
[SPEAKER_00]: a model that can kind of give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, again, it's kind of just
like with any other new input,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need to really put in your
own R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of people that'll call us and
really want the, you know, the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, I haven't found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to build the silver bullet at
home.
