[SPEAKER_01]: So another question I want to ask you is
that, you know, lots of different strains
[SPEAKER_01]: are being extracted now at all different
levels of expertise, but one thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing more and more are people who
are extracting flowers and the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile and the enjoyment level of the
final extraction doesn't taste like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good example for that is Washington
skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved with a run recently where,
you know, the Washington skunk itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had you know, the kind of alcohol
esters and the skunkiness that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: love, but when it was concentrated,
it tastes like burnt rubber and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: clean professional extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like there was anything wrong
with the extraction, but the hint of that
[SPEAKER_01]: burnt rubber that's in those skunk
strains, when you took it in a flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was nice at that density, but then when
you extract it, suddenly it tasted
[SPEAKER_01]: displeasurable and so we made back hash
out of some of it and it had the same
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you remove the plant material and
you really hit on those notes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it became something that people were first
suspicious about smoking because it tasted
[SPEAKER_01]: like burnt rubber, but then when we
realized it was just legit, the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that were in it, you know, no one wanted
to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would choose something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are strategizing what
flower to set up to extract, how would you
[SPEAKER_01]: approach that challenge of the final
product not tasting like your origin
[SPEAKER_01]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the only way that you can do
this is you have to really look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: development cycle for outdoor farmers is
basically a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to look into next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year we would test a number of
varietals and see what we liked and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have them blown in some small capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could say, did this transfer in the
way we had hoped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll smell things and you'll be
like, hmm, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could increase some of this
intensity, it would be highly attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes you hit it head on and
you pull out these wonderful notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: tones that you could barely detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other times you intensify
components that become undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that you can determine
that to me personally, in terms of how the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual determines it is through
testing where you grow it, you run it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you determine is there a value?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a value, you commit next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think cannabis fluctuates so
quickly in a bigger market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like the strain du jour,
but the reality is it's profiles that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hold for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the farmers, what they want to be
able to do is do the testing to find
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals that work for them on their farm
location, cultivation techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: skill level, and then determine where did
it shine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, certain flowers like
skunks, like for me, chasing skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: the skunk project is really about smokable
and joint form for people in my age group
[SPEAKER_00]: who still know how to roll cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way what could happen is
individuals will want to experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way to find out what is the
attraction to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that once you got into skunks,
you weren't going to have the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities because of the theols and the
esters, that you're going to lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these subtleties that mask some of these
other dominant flavors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So burnt rubber in a joint is really neat,
but when you intensify it, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect is edgy and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so depending on what you're trying to
do, and I think most farms really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify their product lines in a sense
of what works well for you as a farmer on
[SPEAKER_00]: your property, and then what do you
believe your sales market is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really doing the research on
what is moving in the market in general
[SPEAKER_00]: and then breaking up your distributions to
match that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to grow all pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow all extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to put yourself in a
stratified market where there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: positions that you're taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the individuals who are
doing it, if they've been successful with
[SPEAKER_00]: selling cannabis, they have an ability to
determine this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not, they should get a hold
of somebody that they know who sells
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that has a good palette that says
this is something that people would like
[SPEAKER_00]: or it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, what it does, it allows you
to make the correct decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's a full year of cyclical
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On indoor guys, it's going to be every two
and a half, three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor can allow you to do a much
quicker cyclical run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can work with people that are
doing indoor, it lets you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: subtleties of how your flower will
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, it's going to be where you
put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to pick up the
environmental changes, meaning the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of the environment on the cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to pick up what you're
using to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you model it exactly well,
then you get the exact same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to do it under
different lighting, different nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, it changes the profile in the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lets you get kind of close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ability to use indoor tools to
help you narrow the scope of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grab, and then you take those
cultivars that you've sifted into a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller population, bring them to your
location and say, hey, these shine here
[SPEAKER_00]: and they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Crembrough Lake Cut that I like to
work with, it's been a couple of years in
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a couple of years in operation
of first we sifted it out out of a big
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took a look at it and said,
what happens when you run it live?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we found out what it did
live, we committed to run a farm live or a
[SPEAKER_00]: good portion of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a multi-year process because I
know that when you get something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional in terms of how you perceive
it, that shouldn't go out of vogue that
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these little micro trends,
but ultimately people want things that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a quality and that quality is just
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can satisfy that, then you have
a couple of years of stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think farmers need to work on that
concept more than every year I have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: red hot because you'll never match that
trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll always really be behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When trends are popping, people are
setting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's not setting it shouldn't
follow it until it becomes developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did my lawyer tell me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to be the leading edge than
the bleeding edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's how you really
approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really points to the
importance of if you really want to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: great product, allow yourself the product
development cycle to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people, they're in a rush to get
to market because they need to get revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: or to satisfy investors or they need to
make their house payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is, a lot of people are
rushing product to market and they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: done a short run to make sure it's a
product they just assume and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: jump ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing this with packaging now
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to make something
excellent, stretch out that product
[SPEAKER_01]: development process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a clear idea what it is you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Apple, when Jobe's came
back to Apple, they had hundreds of ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: that he looked at and he narrowed it down
to basically iPhone, iPod.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cut everything out about those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get everybody focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that have a validity,
that have a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the ability to say that I think
this will work from my prior history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be able to honestly ask
yourself, do you have that vision in your
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously I know nothing about
electronics, but in cannabis, I feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the market well enough to say
this is something that is not that
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive and I don't see the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I believe is
highly attractive and I see the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way it allows you now to figure
out how do we optimize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it took us another year to figure
out the picking time of the creme brulee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the first year we took it about
five or six days later than I took it the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, the subsequent year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was sharper, harder,
less aromatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we picked it a little bit
earlier, we dialed in the curve a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit less than perfect on the flower,
resulted in a far more active concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I found the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sweet spot is you just honestly
to yourself and to your crew that you work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, let's just do product tests and say,
are we satisfied?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are we satisfied?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are we satisfied?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we think it could be better or do
we think it could be worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you start to honestly shape
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of it is you just want to
feel good and you want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times you have to say,
you know, I don't think this is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to take another cycle to
dial it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't, then you realize that's
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with breeders, you know, they might go
down the road two or three years on a line
[SPEAKER_00]: and realize that there's nothing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go all the way back and go
down another road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dedication to it over time is I
think where you get the success in a
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you do is you really find
stuff that resonates with the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: that works well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't intersect, you're really
going to do poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer loves it, but you can't grow
it at your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you love to grow it, but no one wants
to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither one of those extremes work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be some little Venn diagram
in the middle where it touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part of R&D that's needed
that you really connect growability,
[SPEAKER_00]: workability, sellability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
