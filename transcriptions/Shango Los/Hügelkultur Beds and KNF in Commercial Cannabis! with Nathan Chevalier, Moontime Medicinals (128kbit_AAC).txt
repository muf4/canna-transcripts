[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate, thank you so much for having me
over to the farm today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tour was like Exhilarating actually I
have never seen Who go culture deployed at
[SPEAKER_00]: such a size, you know You know
permaculture classes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see one or a couple And of course,
I've seen lots of books where where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a side view of one So you understand
how they're built but your your who go
[SPEAKER_00]: culture field is like astonishing right
and it's really cool right now because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, some of them are Finished and you're
already planted into them Whereas other of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are still like these holes and you're
building them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never be able to Describe it as well
as you will so so just tell us about that
[SPEAKER_00]: that who go culture deployment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a it's been a challenge from
the beginning we've We hope to have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything done by the solstice and here
we are a couple weeks past that and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: still working on it, so we've
[SPEAKER_01]: We've Had a lot of issues sourcing
material to put into our hugels we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of downed wood We've been bringing in
PG&E for some for some electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done some brush clearing some
tree thinning stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had Some sources just getting it
down to the farm and and into its proper
[SPEAKER_00]: home has been a big challenge Give people
an idea of how big it is right because for
[SPEAKER_00]: most people though We're like getting
stuff your hookah culture is simply just
[SPEAKER_00]: grab that but like you need a hell of a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, so we're doing 6300 square feet
is the size of our of our plot and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, we're doing somewhere around 14 or
15 hugels that average from 25 feet wide
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to almost 75 feet wide So
that's a lot of biomass it takes because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all going into the ground it is it
is and and we've seen different methods of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing Hugal culture and mounting it up
just on your native soil We decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually trench out some some holes and
excavate three feet down and backfill with
[SPEAKER_01]: rotten firewood that we've had around the
property and Some of these downed trees to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting it all down into where it needs
to go has been a challenge, but But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: almost all there and it feels good now
that it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I believe in I like I like that
you incorporated those big those big Bags
[SPEAKER_00]: that I saw last time I was here that I
posted to my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were those with those 300 gallons 200
gallons and so You know, it's one thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the the big tree sections there and
then you're filling it in with You know a
[SPEAKER_00]: brush and the the natural forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you call fluff force?
[SPEAKER_00]: Duff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Duff on the ground But then you know
by by you pouring all of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know aged and loved active living soil
on it your You're pretty much inoculating
[SPEAKER_00]: it with all the best parts of your last
several seasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the idea we're hoping so
yeah, that's kind of what we're shooting
[SPEAKER_01]: for is The mound of decaying firewood
below mixed with some of the native soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been excavated out We've ran into
tons of rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a challenge is getting some
of the big boulders out of there But we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited about repurposing the rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So As it's challenging, it's also allowing
us to do other things around the property
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we've got the we've got the
native soil back in there and then the the
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil to add some more microbes to
our fungus from the rotting firewood and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we basically with the forest stuff
and the potting soil we top it off with
[SPEAKER_01]: one more layer of Natural soil that's been
excavated out or collected from the
[SPEAKER_01]: perimeters in different areas Try not to
take too much from one area To kind of do
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild make sure it's all mixed up here
a little bit from here a little bit from
[SPEAKER_01]: there, right, right For one reason for
diversity different areas, but also you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to take too much from one area,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strip it right, right You know the the you
know on one end you've got the hugel
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures that are you're literally
building out today as soon as I get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your way, right and you've got the other
ones that are already planted and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: any plant when it gets transplanted Is
gonna have some amount of shock and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like, you know ten days in and
they're all kind of rebounding Yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: must have a whole lot of complex feels for
you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here we are in the first Licensed
and taxed season in California and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do two things You're both trying
you're you're you're you're deploying this
[SPEAKER_00]: new growing tech I mean not that it's new
that it's never existed before but being
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to both your farm and cannabis
in general But but you're also doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like the highest pressure cannabis
season in California ever where
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's trying to make money and not
lose the farm because everything's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a mess right now That must they mean there
must be challenges in that for you to both
[SPEAKER_00]: be wanting to do this creatively and
sustainably and good for the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also Know that you can Like if you if
you screw up man, it's a big deal It's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a big deal I think I explained
to you earlier that the place that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating is typically about half of our
our our yield in in years past and Looking
[SPEAKER_01]: down at it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's definitely an unsettling
feeling to to see How small everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point of the year, but we did try
to make up for that a little bit by
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing plant counts We're going more
in a and in a and in the same area so
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just hoping that it's gonna fill in
and do what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Cautiously optimistic, but I think
it's I think it's gonna be okay the one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that we were kind of contemplating
to was maybe to just Have the have the
[SPEAKER_01]: square footage sit sit dormant for this
year and plant a cover crop on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we decided that it was worth the
challenge to go ahead and take it on and
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turning out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's not going to be a total
failure But it's not going to be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: epic thing We knew that coming in to we
knew that we'd heard, you know some trials
[SPEAKER_01]: and tribulations other places That
inspired us and and we also feel that With
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully the market being as low as it
can get right now You know that that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to affect us too much and At
least you're using Soil that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: alive, you know because you use the soil
from the 200 pound bag or 200 gallon bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them in there You know a lot of
people who will build a hugelkultur from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch They'll use you know fresh,
you know Potting soil or something and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'll inoculate this and that and
then it really takes a year for it to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all kind of All together But by using
the soil that's already activated in it I
[SPEAKER_00]: would think that as soon as your roots of
your newly transplanted plants hit down
[SPEAKER_00]: It's be like hitting the mother load and
they're gonna like oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know here here's a rhizosphere Here's
a here's you know, the mycelium here's
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and then they'll and then I
guess that's the I hope right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said that you increased your plant
counts this year to give you more more
[SPEAKER_00]: room for error essentially And and I think
you said that you're you're about three
[SPEAKER_00]: times the size of what your medical 215
grow was Yeah, yeah, I think somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not all completely planted yet So
it's it's still up in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somewhere in that neighborhood So one
of the reasons that I visited you before
[SPEAKER_00]: and why I just I'm generally attracted to
moon time Medicinals product is is because
[SPEAKER_00]: you use KNF inputs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a big fan of bottled stuff and
a lot of what you're putting in Starts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm and then you know you FPJ it and
then you're putting it on your own plants
[SPEAKER_00]: So so everything's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two part question number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're growing on the property that
you're then then then you're then
[SPEAKER_00]: fermenting and then also what it's been
like to scale up from You know where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been the last several years growing
for what was essentially a Third of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got going, you know that kind of
scaling, you know, you're not using small
[SPEAKER_00]: mason jars anymore Right things get much
bigger at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so kind of color that in for us,
would you?
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, so so previously using KNF on our
our veggie garden is essentially the only
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that we've had in it in
previous years and We do 2,000 square feet
[SPEAKER_01]: in the veggie garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when training is a good training,
but when you scale it up to 13 5,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a it's a challenge and like
you said starting out with mason jars,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've actually and started to employ our
Pickling crocs that we've used in previous
[SPEAKER_01]: years for Kim cheese and krauts and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got three large crocs that we
ferment Various things we do horsetail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just harvested locally on the
property We'll do pea shoots from our
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that we grow purposefully
For that we'll do lemon balm to add for
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to to our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that The correlation there
translates straight to our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do Trying to think what else would
do some of our cannabis plants will do our
[SPEAKER_01]: males will do You got some comfrey coming
along for you comes along for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll go in there at times thistle Just
anything that grows around the property
[SPEAKER_01]: and it Is very vigorous and doesn't show
much Susceptibility to anything is what we
[SPEAKER_01]: like to use thistles is a really good one
in the horsetail Probably two really good
[SPEAKER_01]: examples of that But But yeah beyond that
we've we've got into the LAB and we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: into Some of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just scratching the surface on on
some of the on some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated I guess K and F Ferments we're
really excited about getting the fish
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna source some fish from from out
in shelter Cove from a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: fishermen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be good You know, if you're
gonna do that, you should listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: the interview I did with Chris Trump He
talks about how while you're doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: for your plants also do some for your own
Fish sauce for your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he's all like he's all like you
wouldn't think you want to eat it but Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: my god, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might I might need to get some of
that from you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so So let's talk a little bit about
the trade-off of you know, so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you know, you've never been a big
bottle guy And and now you're really going
[SPEAKER_00]: to hole into producing your own inputs It
takes time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the time to get yourself educated
to collect the stuff on the property to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and ferment it You have to wait
for it to ferment Then you're straining
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you know the bottling part doesn't
take much time and then and then
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing it Whereas other people are
like and they open the bottle and they go
[SPEAKER_00]: to town, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see the trade-off being behind
the the time that it takes to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: the ferments and the your yield increases
versus saving the time and using a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: and You know because that's it that's a
trade-off and I and I know you weigh those
[SPEAKER_01]: in very particular Ways yeah, I certainly
do I feel a lot of the nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottled ingredients that I use Tend to be
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're high quality nutrients or microbes
and I've just found that With the way the
[SPEAKER_01]: markets going the way the margins are
shrinking that that is the best way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know of to To increase my bottom line is
to take out the things that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly control and we We love microbes
we love to put as many different microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can into the soil that's been our
strategy in years past but now we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make them on our own by doing
the IMO boxes and and You know doing
[SPEAKER_01]: different doing different things to
harness what we have locally and Try and
[SPEAKER_01]: use that is our goal and I feel like the
time that that takes is directly
[SPEAKER_01]: Equivalent if not a money savings to going
and buying a bottle of nutrients somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know It goes without saying the
environmental impact of the of the waste
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that the microplastics or
or something Yeah, totally gets you and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like this, you know,
you're you're a probiotic grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that you're producing your
own inputs I would think offers a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-satisfaction To right like I'm doing
it my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that kind of thing So,
um, so the last question I have for you is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know, this is a really You know,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime summer this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer because you know people have
shifted to the licensed and taxed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and You know, you've been a
farmer for years and years and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into your cycle of how you spread your
time When you do things and you get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a farmer Routine, but then this
year you're you're having to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: like all those other random stuff like
like find a distributor Develop packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: develop your new website and and logos,
you know You know find extraction partners
[SPEAKER_00]: go to county meetings Go to your track and
trace class and and and Work with PG need
[SPEAKER_00]: a fight to try to get your power here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's your experience been this
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unique In trying to do all of that
bureaucratic stuff while you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: actually just trying to be a farmer Yeah,
it's it's been a big challenge We've we've
[SPEAKER_01]: staffed up a little bit from years past I
guess just recently initially I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to do it with just me and my lead
cultivator and I found that I was being
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled in way too many different
directions and we needed to bring a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: more guys in so We brought in a couple new
hires.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been great additions and they've
They've picked up on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've brought a lot of their own
knowledge in which is good from the from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Humboldt State botany and forestry
department so we've had we've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: really good help and I'm lucky to have
these guys on and helping me and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I feel like that's that's been
the the big thing is While I love to be
[SPEAKER_01]: out and get my hands dirty I need to free
myself up and be able to do some things
[SPEAKER_01]: and having some people that I can really
rely on Do you have you found that even
[SPEAKER_00]: with the really high quality skilled help
that you brought on
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Everyone's distracted by legal and
license related stuff that they've got it,
[SPEAKER_00]: too Are you finding that that you and your
people are kind of behind too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's such an extraordinarily
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, without a doubt and the fact that we
also started
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's already showing some
benefits and you know, it's It's good to
[SPEAKER_01]: see it's good to get it done and out of
the way something about as far as The
[SPEAKER_01]: water conservation is the thing that
really is kind of stood out with me on
[SPEAKER_01]: this project and how much that Those
plants is gonna just soak up all the water
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're excited but Cool well,
I'm excited to see it because I've just
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I've never seen Hugo culture
deployed at that size at all for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: even food But then to see with my favorite
plant on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So so we'll come back in in September
when they're all looking beautiful Right
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we'll bring the drone with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we'll get some we'll get some
good above shot So sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you You You You You
