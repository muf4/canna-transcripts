[SPEAKER_01]: We are at a very awkward time in the
relationship between the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using cannabis for health and
spirituality for millennia, and yet
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the last 80 years or so of
prohibition, modern generations barely
[SPEAKER_01]: know the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a society, we are going to have to go
through a process of relearning how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, how best to grow and hybridize
her for medicine, and of course we are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to undo all of the reefer
madness fed to us by the US government and
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional players like pharmaceutical
companies and law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that prohibition is unraveling in the
US, we have stopped strong-arming other
[SPEAKER_01]: nations to fight cannabis in their own
countries too, and now their freedoms are
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukraine, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica,
the Czech Republic, and many more
[SPEAKER_01]: countries have varying forms of cannabis
freedom, and it is spreading globally at a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast rate now that the US has stopped
bullying everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there is Portugal too who
shocked the world and legalized all drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2001, and has seen an addiction drop by
50% and violent crime rates drop too,
[SPEAKER_01]: not to mention everyone is much happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do not yet have in the US are
updated social mores for how to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other about cannabis, how to think
about cannabis as medicine, and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: build a business model for distribution
that will work to the benefit of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, in the cannabis activist scene,
we have much of this figured out for
[SPEAKER_01]: today, but as more and more humans bring
cannabis into their lives, what is
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted socially will all change again
and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's guest is Dr. Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a medical geographer and a leading
expert in cannabis medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinology.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is often a panelist and speaker at top
cannabis medicine conventions all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry-picking his accomplishments to
describe him to you was really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's done so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, he is a palliative medicine
physician and associate hospice medical
[SPEAKER_01]: director at MultiCare Auburn Medical
Center in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: He received both a PhD and an MD from the
University of Washington, where he now
[SPEAKER_01]: teaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also has degrees in chemistry,
philosophy, and religious studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a National Science Foundation graduate
research fellow, he wrote a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: dissertation entitled, The Medical
Geography of Cannabinoid Botanicals in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State, Access, Delivery,
and Distress, conducted under NIH first
[SPEAKER_01]: issued federal certificates of
confidentiality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Agarwal successfully led the effort to
get the American Medical Association to
[SPEAKER_01]: call for a review of the scheduling
classification of cannabis in 2009,
[SPEAKER_01]: their first such statement in 72 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He serves on the editorial advisory board
of the National Cancer Institute's PDQ
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer cam information summary on cannabis
and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, he is associate member of the
Humboldt Institute for Interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Research and the New York
Academy of Medicine, an honorary trustee
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Medicinal Cannabis Foundation of
India, and vice president of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington Physicians for Social
Responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not even half of his bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor to have Dr. Sunil Agarwal
unshaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for today, let's look at the big
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back, way back, and consider the
historical roots of cannabis and humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will go back 30,000 years and page
through the story of the love affair
[SPEAKER_01]: between humans and a plant named cannabis
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Sunil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's great to be here, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you making the time to
join us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to start at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Green Flower Medical Cannabis
Summit, you were painting a really
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful image of perhaps how
cannabinoids came into existence like 38
[SPEAKER_01]: million years ago as a protective response
to the increasing UV radiation from the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you go ahead and share that
perspective with us again right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I read in a
geography book that has come out nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: recently from a University of New Mexico
professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really just trying to understand
the deep history of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeographically, where it evolved and
when it evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just because part of what
people have lost is a connection of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to the natural world,
the biosphere, like the web of life that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the context I was
giving that history in when I spoke at the
[SPEAKER_00]: summit, trying to make that illegal alien
nature of cannabis back to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is part of reintegrating it back
into our sense of Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this advanced wind pollinated plant
that we know now as cannabis with two
[SPEAKER_00]: sexes and occasionally hermaphrodites,
it evolved in a part of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: central, south, southern Asia,
based on archaeological evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on genetic evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the interesting thing is
that it evolved in a place that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time it was evolving,
it was also evolving in a place that was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting higher and higher elevation every
year, because it came at a time when the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth itself was going through a radical
transformation, whereby at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indian subcontinent actually had not
joined Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a period of time about 50
million years ago when that plate collided
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Asian landmass, and you had the
formation of the Himalayan mountain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, as you know,
the tallest mountain range in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, at the same time, you have this
cannabis plant that's evolving in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you survive in a place where,
you know, every year the elevation is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting higher and higher as a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one theory is that it has to create
chemicals to protect itself from the
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just, you know, it's not just
cannabinoids, but terpenes, but
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids especially have these very
nice properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably one of the theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really attracted to that story
because, you know, it really respects the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant itself as having its own life story,
because we always talk about what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant can do for us, but really the plant
itself has its own story, and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it eventually comes in contact with
humans, and we start to cultivate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it starts to influence us,
and then we start to influence it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got its own storyline as well,
and I think that's a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it evolved, it has to survive,
and it did a very, very good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thrived and it adapted, and that's part
of, I think, why it is so hardy and able
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt in so many places, because it
kind of has this cauldron of great stress
[SPEAKER_00]: under which it was formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, most people don't see
cannabis as being the long-term cure that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've always used, you know, except for
maybe the last 80 years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really think about that,
you know, cannabis was a central component
[SPEAKER_01]: of the modern pharmacopeia, but also that
we humans have been interacting with this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for tens of thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like to talk about,
you know, the place that the plant has,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in human history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you walk us through the human
relationship with cannabis over the ages
[SPEAKER_01]: to put the modern prohibition in context?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a vast and long story,
so anything I say in this short time will
[SPEAKER_00]: not do full justice, but I mean,
you know, I guess the point of place to
[SPEAKER_00]: start really is that it, you know,
where it evolved in that part of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: is where people started, you know,
first coming into contact with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in South Asia, where my
ancestors are from 18,000 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got, that's the earliest dating of
signs of domestication of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been some other records
in earlier places, earlier times in that
[SPEAKER_00]: same region, but you know, at that time,
you know, we don't know, but the earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: writings that we get from that
civilization, that reference cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very much in the context of healing,
which is not distinct from spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, spiritual development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that, you know, you can't,
that the two are separate is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: modern fallacy, I guess you can say,
and in those days, there's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: distinction between the idea of,
you know, achieving certain states of
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual development, meditative states,
states of self-awareness, states of peace,
[SPEAKER_00]: tranquility, and a sense of healing,
which is, you know, pretty transformative
[SPEAKER_00]: and fundamental to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if disease, it comes from the word
dis-ease, to not be at ease, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's potentially part of,
you know, putting people at peace,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of the fundamental stamping
out of disease is where it came,
[SPEAKER_00]: or dis-ease is where it came into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly also it was seen in the
development of Ayurvedic medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional medicine systems, such as
there were systems called Unani and Tibi,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of came from Persia,
and have other historical influences,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis found homes in those,
traditional Chinese medicine, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: found a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the suggestions from the Ebers
Papyrus, which is one of the oldest
[SPEAKER_00]: medical documents that we have,
which comes from ancient Egypt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are formulas for the use of
cannabis, and there it's much more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, analgesic, much dealing with
relieving pressure in the eyes or pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still had a dual role, both in this
spiritual realm and in kind of dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with pain, dealing with problems of
inflammation, and I guess over the ages
[SPEAKER_00]: that this cannabis spread through the
parts of the world where those forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: systems of medical practice were used,
Chinese medicine, Unani medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Persian medicine, Indian medicine,
they went around in the ancient world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think, you know, there was early
writings of the use in prevention of
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures from much older people,
older times in Syria, and the first
[SPEAKER_00]: citations that the, like if you look at
the government of India, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional knowledge library,
digital library, where they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: record all the traditional uses of plants
and things in their heritage so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get scooped up by big companies that
say, oh, we came up with that first or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're trying to establish
prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make reference to, I believe it's a
12th century textbook, by a guy named Ibn
[SPEAKER_00]: Sina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ibn Sina, he has different names depending
on which part of the world you're in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this guy's textbook of medicine from
that time, from sort of the Arabic
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance, was widely read all over both
the East and the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taught at like Oxford and,
you know, even in the old monastic
[SPEAKER_00]: European traditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the citation that I think they
intentionally use to show that this very
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known Arabic scholar of medicine and
many other things was citing cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: its medical uses, and it was being read
both in the East and the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of was, I think, a big
recognition that the most advanced forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of medicine into the Renaissance and the
medieval period, you know, cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next big wave that you can say
where we finally get much more wider
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure in the 19th, it happens in the
19th century, and there was ongoing use
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the centuries between the 19th
and the 12th centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't want to go into so
many different details that we can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: with witches and traditional herbalists in
Europe and indigenous uses in other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of Africa and other places that don't get
a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's big, big moment in the
sun, so to speak, happens in the 1840s
[SPEAKER_00]: when, due to the British East India
Company's, you know, activities in India,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to import into India
leading medical doctors from the 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century who were trained at the top
academies of medicine in Europe in those
[SPEAKER_00]: days, which was the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you got Dr. William
O'Shaughnessy, who trained in Edinburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this was a center of medical
training, not just in Europe, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the United States would go to
train in Edinburgh in those days because
[SPEAKER_00]: there really wasn't big centers in the US
in those time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this doctor who was already
kind of a genius Irish doctor who had
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out the treatment of cholera,
who nobody had ever had figured out that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, boy, we should probably give IV fluids
to cholera victims with electrolytes in
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that they don't dehydrate to
death, you know, from diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was his like, you know,
doctoral thesis and a pretty brilliant
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably saved many lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he then was, he got a lucrative
position in the British East India
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, we want you to go to Calcutta,
which is where our headquarters are in
[SPEAKER_00]: India at that time, the capital of the
British India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to set up a modern medical
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the oldest modern medical
college in Asia now and still in
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he established it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to, he was such a kind of
polyglot and thoughtful man that he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, let's bring in, let's try to develop
the principles where we can teach in the
[SPEAKER_00]: native tongue to the native Indians,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're called colonialists after
all, so they don't always have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: regard for native ideas, but they did,
he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that process of
establishing chemistry department and the
[SPEAKER_00]: college, he said, you know, I really need
to learn the local medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of, we don't have to import
all of these from Europe and we can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of learn from them and learn from Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started seeing the use of cannabis
in the marketplaces, the local fakirs and
[SPEAKER_00]: healers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, this is an interesting
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started experimenting with it in
medical students and animals and finally
[SPEAKER_00]: in patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he kind of made his career,
at least the first half of his career,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was such a brilliant guy that he has
actually many firsts to his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he wrote a paper that in the 1830s
that got international currency on the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, indica or ganja, Indian hemp,
you know, and he covered lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, convulsions, tetanus,
some conditions that, infantile
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsions and tetanus and also terminal
rabies, again, were conditions where there
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was no cure, but because we
didn't have, you know, modern antibiotics
[SPEAKER_00]: in those days, antivirals or, you know,
innocuous, inoculums, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was able to bring a lot of relief to
people who otherwise would die very
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible deaths, you know, and unable to
eat or drink because of the convulsions
[SPEAKER_00]: from terminal rabies when it gets into
your nervous system or severe stiffness
[SPEAKER_00]: from tetanus when it gets really advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's able to relax those muscles and
allow people to eat and drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course he did have other,
you know, younger patients who survived
[SPEAKER_00]: convulsions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of thing was excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: His discoveries really launched modern,
the use of cannabis in modern medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, we've just had a
trajectory since that time where it's come
[SPEAKER_00]: and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It achieved another peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it started peaking at the late 19th
century, early 20th century, leading
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors from around in the early 20th
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. William Osler, who's the father of
internal medicine, Dr. Gower, who
[SPEAKER_00]: basically did some of the earliest studies
in Parkinson's, Dr. Reynolds, who first
[SPEAKER_00]: established the typology of seizures,
epilepsy disorders, who was Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: Victoria's physician, all of these leading
doctors, you know, founder of Johns
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopkins University, they all knew cannabis
and they all knew it was an important part
[SPEAKER_00]: of their armamentarium, thanks to the work
of O'Shaughnessy and their own research on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and use in their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that finally, that area kind of came to
an end in the 40s, early 40s, when the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal, it got political and,
you know, there was increasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: now that the United States was a colonial
power, this is one theory, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had taken over the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had started using, you know,
dealing with Mexico much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually, you know, I think they saw
cannabis in a different light now
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with people that they were
trying to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it became much more of a
political football and the medical arts
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis started falling out of
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a move to more industrial
medicine, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticalized version of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though there had been
attempts to grow cannabis in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States for pharmaceutical purposes,
somehow it just didn't take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, ultimately, I think that we
have to wait until really the 70s and 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: and then now in the peak 90s and beyond
that now we're having this next cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time we are much more prepared
and much more, you know, we can learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have this endocannabinoid
system science that has developed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late part of the 20th century that really
changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now we finally have a deeper
understanding of actually on a molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: level what are these cannabinoids that are
in cannabis that evolved all those 38
[SPEAKER_00]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing in our human bodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an epic answer, Sunil.
[SPEAKER_01]: No wonder you've got a dry throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad that we got that recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture that you just painted from 38
million years ago to us learning about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system in the 90s and then
what's happening with modern medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, that's an epic picture you just
painted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because your answer was so full,
we need to take our first short break
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for very impactful cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasts and patients have gotten
educated enough that they avoid growers
[SPEAKER_01]: who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they keep their crops safe and pest free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, broad mites, shore flies,
white fly and others too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shane Golos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Dr. Sunil
Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sunil, before the break, we were
talking about how the medical cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: come to us through the ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in the modern world, when we know
about the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are more prepared to learn about
the influence that this beautiful plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can have on our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, animal study evidence
showing cannabinoids kill cancer cells
[SPEAKER_01]: started to begin to accrue in the early
70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why do you think that
institutional actors like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: government and especially major cancer
study nonprofits aren't focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and talking more about it
publicly and even excitedly, they just
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to be ignoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a sad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given how much the leaping causes of
death in the country now are cancers and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in many other parts of the
world, we really are missing an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to study and develop
treatments that involve cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we kind of—I mean,
it was starting to get—in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big interest in funding on
cannabis research going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was interest in the national
institutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, politics won over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a sense, I think, that,
you know, the Nixon administration was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, we don't really want to get
that stuff out there too much because we
[SPEAKER_00]: are—I'm already using this as a tool for
oppression against anti-war protesters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really—I've studied the
Nixon tapes where they actually—he talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about his motivations and he tries to fire
the people who are at the world's leading
[SPEAKER_00]: medical research institute, the NIH,
who have argued that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the restrictions are too much and there
needs to—you know, the harms have been
[SPEAKER_00]: exaggerated and, you know, we should not
be treating this like kryptonite or
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, he was not—that was not
part of his mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that he was—and his
administration was somebody that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any, you know, compassion for cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually hear other recordings
where he talks about, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's terrible what happens to cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have all the pain relief that
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's just—there was
just such a fundamental lack of awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding that cannabis could
offer anything of value beyond getting—as
[SPEAKER_00]: he talks about it, getting charged,
getting buzzed, getting—you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the view of it, that it was just
this total escapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it didn't have anything—any
serious value to it, despite the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, doctors and folks above
him or smarter than him were telling him
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why the initial research
got really shut down or didn't get renewed
[SPEAKER_00]: or developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other movements going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was always the idea,
well, cannabinoids, who owns that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to make a bunch of money off
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to mass supply that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that same time in the 70s is when you
started seeing the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy, modern chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was done at the NIH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first use was called methotrexate to
treat a certain form of cancer that women
[SPEAKER_00]: who are pregnant can get, choreocarcinoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, I mean, I think people would just—you
know, they just didn't—they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how cannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't understand, you know,
how we could produce that in a big way
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was too much of a political
football.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, you know, we dropped
that thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, there was
increasing awareness in the 70s that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis had a role for palliation in
cancer, and that did start to spread in
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee, even states that today aren't
medical cannabis states, like Tennessee,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, had a cannabis and cancer
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: People figured out that it could help them
with the nausea and vomiting associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with these new chemotherapy drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was going on for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they shut that program
down during, you know, in the 90s and when
[SPEAKER_00]: the new or war on drugs got going under
Reagan and then the first Bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the AIDS patients also were
trying to get in at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that—all of the political
factors got into the way that stopped us
[SPEAKER_00]: from really moving forward on these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took—it took passage of
California's medical cannabis law in 96 to
[SPEAKER_00]: force the federal government to start
allowing modern clinical trials research
[SPEAKER_00]: in cancer and also in HIV, thanks to the
work of Donald Abrams at UCSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he cited the passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passage of the California law and his
letters to the National Institutes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to do something to approve his
studies, which they finally did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was that big long lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a dark ages period of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's been a reemergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, even to this day,
because of the powers that be and the
[SPEAKER_00]: funding streams in the United States,
we have not put a significant amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: resources in the cancer and the
cannabinologic approaches to cancer areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there was this big moonshot
initiative that the vice president just
[SPEAKER_00]: did, Joe Biden, you know, or several of us
put in suggestions to the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you need to fund this type of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is—there's a huge promise in
multiple types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't—it didn't come up in their
latest report as a priority area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at more—you know,
they're looking at data sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: registries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at immunotherapies and all
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think there's a lot of,
you know, economic like sort of issues
[SPEAKER_00]: there that go into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other countries are developing cancer
and cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they did a study in Israel where
they looked at the use of cannabidiol to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent what's called Graff versus Host
disease, which is a horrible complication
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cure for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get what's called stem cell
transplants, hematopoic stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants, and they can get cured from
blood cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking at other disorders
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great thing, you know,
when you can kind of reset your bone
[SPEAKER_00]: marrow and blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had a fatal blood cancer like
lymphoma leukemia, you know, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: treat it and cure it with a stem cell
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes you can get a reaction
where the graft of your transplant attacks
[SPEAKER_00]: your own body, Graff versus Host disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very severe complication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get a lot of pain,
weakness, stiffness, and it can make your
[SPEAKER_00]: life quality terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a phase two study where,
you know, cannabidiol had a huge impact in
[SPEAKER_00]: the prevention of that condition in,
you know, in patients who got these stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cell transplants, 300 milligrams a day,
starting a few days before transplant and
[SPEAKER_00]: until 30 days after transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really had a huge reduction in the
likelihood of developing the most severe
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of GVHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was done in Israel in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think New Zealand, they're doing
more research on cannabis compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: actual treatment of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: UCSF did a glioblastoma study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm seeing a renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be, it's slow, but it is
starting in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we are just keep, we have to
keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep, we have to do much more
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to fund it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think really there needs to be a lot
more about what's called empiric treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: trials where people, we really need to
collect a lot of primary data,
[SPEAKER_00]: real good quality data where people are
using certain varieties with certain types
[SPEAKER_00]: of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all cancer is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that one size fits all is really,
you know, not the way that cancer works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we, and I don't believe that
cannabinoids are, you know, the sole
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really foolish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is such a complex condition and
there's many things that can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be seen as an integrated part
of cancer treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we really are, you know,
still very behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very hopeful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the National Cancer Institute has
taken on cannabinoids in cancer and put up
[SPEAKER_00]: a very thorough review for the public and
for doctors and health professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty bold move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's government funded and
that's, they go through a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details of the mechanisms by which
cannabinoids kill cancer, which is by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, a very unique mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the problems that we
have in cancer treatments is that so many
[SPEAKER_00]: other cells suffer when you're trying to
kill cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's unique about cannabinoids is
oftentimes they are very targeted and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You leave your healthy cells alone and
you, you know, target the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sunil, you know, one thing I want to
ask you before we go to break that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always, you know, been curious about is
that, you know, when I learned to what
[SPEAKER_01]: degree cannabinoids can, you know,
start to cause apoptosis and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stop the spread of cancer cells and that
there was something there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It astonished me and continues to that
there are so many majorly funded cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofits that say up front that,
you know, we will find a cure for cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're funding all this cancer
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, you know, you don't hear about
them talking about cannabis or pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: the, for example, over cannabis or
lobbying the government and it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming more from patients themselves and
skipping over these major nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can kind of give me a short
answer before we go to commercial,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, why do you think that these
large cancer nonprofits are not speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: with a louder voice to try to push this
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, listen, this is the schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Status of cannabis, marijuana really is,
there are areas where that doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are areas where that really
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you're talking at this
level of official cancer research,
[SPEAKER_00]: these things have a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, you know, we have,
that's part of the fundamentalism around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that the government maintains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, schedule one is a type of
fundamentalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that there is no safety under
medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no accepted medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they're trying to talk a big
game about research right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA even, but, you know, the
maintenance of that idea is so far off
[SPEAKER_00]: from what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's still very difficult to
touch for some of these mainstream
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, while you, while you take a drink of
some water and rest your voice for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second, we're going to do another
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look inside this crystal ball with me for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking just a couple months into the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing the future of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show sure has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've continued to interview fascinating
cannabis industry luminaries and our
[SPEAKER_01]: audience has gotten huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has doubled and redoubled and doubled
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are high fives all around the
Shaping Fire world headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: New listeners are subscribing every day
and begin to listen to the back catalog of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the great interviews there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is where the Shaping Fire
audience learns about your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were incredibly smart today to become
an early adopter and place a commercial in
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire's early episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, today, you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay a fraction of the cost we'll be asking
in just two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, all the other audience that
listens to our back catalog of interviews
[SPEAKER_01]: will hear about your company again and
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
so new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shane Golos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Dr. Sunil
Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Sunil, you know, the show so far has
been so educational for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first part of the show,
we were talking about the epic history of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and our interaction with it over
the centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second part of the show,
we were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the prohibition years and how the
marijuana fundamentalism has still got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold on us, but we're more prepared now to
learn from the plant and how it can work
[SPEAKER_01]: with our endocannabinoid system than at
any other time in human existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, that's a really
great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like you to do now is,
you know, open your mind's eye and imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: a future where humans are caring for their
endocannabinoid system with
[SPEAKER_01]: supplementation through the use of
cannabis and, you know, maybe eating
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system enhancing foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what does that society look
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the human health look like of those
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's our best case scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think the important
thing is to recognize, first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is a aspect of health,
aspect of medicine, an aspect of science
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fundamentally cannabinological.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is there is a part of our
lives, a part of our health that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: critically governed by the science of
cannabinoid signaling, the science of
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with, you know, and through
which I mean, from which arise or I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of which came out of the study of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fundamental role that the plant
cannabis and plays, but it goes beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, too, because we've we've found
cannabinoids in other plants and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our own internal cannabinoid signaling
system, which is even older than cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the evolution of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a this is an area I think
should be called cannabinology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it it gets us to
sort of recognize that, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if this is an essential part of biology
that helps us regulate our homeostasis
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, it's involved in mood,
appetite, memory, inflammation,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, perception, muscle tone,
you know, bone growth, tumor regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, seizure activity, gastrointestinal
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's playing an important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we recognize that,
then we can start to understand our health
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions a little bit more deeply,
trying to see if there is a dysregulation
[SPEAKER_00]: or problem in endocannabinoid system,
either in Oregon or or system wide that
[SPEAKER_00]: might explain like clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think Dr. Ethan Russo,
who I know you've interviewed before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, has really done a lot of great
work to start thinking seriously about
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical endocannabinoid deficiency
syndromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is there's a lot to be
said for that when you have certain
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters around migraines, irritable
bowel, fibromyalgia, endometriosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably many more we'll start to see
as we start studying on a molecular level,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic level, you know, endocannabinoid
tone, endocannabinoid deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a finer grain understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think we've just so that
part of that is starting to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the health conditions through a
endocannabinoid lens, and then recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, well, there's a there's ways that we
can can intervene or we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: treat people can have an illogically to
make a difference to restore the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, the baseline issues
that are impairing their health quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and causing symptoms and issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's it's not just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also preventative health side,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, so there's two different
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's treatment of acute issues and then
there's making sure issues don't come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and you know, making wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I think the the first side of
it would be where you integrate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid logic approaches, thinking and
treatments into all branches of medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: that are relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think, you know, we talked about
oncology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think neurology, rheumatology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those these are some of them and,
you know, pain medicine and palliative
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some of the really and I should also
mention rehabilitation, which is my one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my central specializations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of those areas are really ripe
for having a cannabinoid logic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we I just so excited to think
about what that would look like if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to say, OK, you know,
that's one approach that we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So patients who go to clinics or,
you know, they're looking on on their or
[SPEAKER_00]: they you know, they see their doctors or
their whatever allied health professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: and they start seeing that those people
recognize that maybe there's a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: problem at the basis of your oncologic,
rheumatologic, et cetera, problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if there's a way that we can
boost your endocannabinoid activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe with some ratio of botanical
cannabinoids, X whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's, you know, see how that does for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, we've done some research on
that with people with just your condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out that, you know,
one to one ratio of THC to CBT within a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant extraction makes a big
difference in terms of restoring that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've seen there's been research
that shows in multiple sclerosis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that they if they take a one to one
extract over time, they have they walk
[SPEAKER_00]: better and they have less emergency room
visits, not to mention better pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been in double blind placebo
controlled studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just you know, I think it's just a
matter of translating what research we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have and actually starting to roll this
kind of thing out so that people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: these conditions know their providers know
and the patients directly know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something available for people
around the corner or in their in their
[SPEAKER_00]: health care system where that's provided
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that local medicine
systems are an excellent way to go because
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can be produced locally and we
can we can start to quantify and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make varieties and preparations
that everybody can understand and share
[SPEAKER_00]: and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think ultimately, you you just have
a I also believe there's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic aspect on the preventative
health side and the kind of complementary
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative side where you're looking at
the gardens and growing green plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: how people can have more interaction with
that if that, you know, makes their makes
[SPEAKER_00]: their days better, their pain better,
their mood better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a nice aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also dovetails into the
preventative health side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to use cannabis instead
of alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what does it mean to use cannabis as a
as a tool for yoga, meditation,
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual pursuits, you know, recreational
therapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does that, you know,
how does that impact overall quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and stress, which we know is a big
part of heart disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's, you know, some of this
is so hard to to envision because we just
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still stuck in this fundamentalism,
which keeps us keeps the relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis really monotonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once we recognize that
actually, you know, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: commonwealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the right to access cannabis
and also have relationships with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just with consumption, but production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think health therapeutic
relationships should be a forefront of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever that looks like to you,
I think there's a lot of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I didn't even mention like
infections and diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, heart disease, stroke
prevention, dementia, preventing and
[SPEAKER_00]: treating dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so many exciting things that
could be that cannabinoids hold promise
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just I think that future is very
bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, you know, we just got to like
collectively get off this fundamentalism
[SPEAKER_00]: and just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can imagine how, you know,
as as cannabis becomes less stigmatized
[SPEAKER_01]: and this research that you're talking
about is happening more and more,
[SPEAKER_01]: that what we're going to be seeing is a
decrease of each of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: categories of human ailments and just less
sickness across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad that that you were
able to take time to be on the show today
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of put it all on this long
timeline so that we can really look at how
[SPEAKER_01]: human health and the cannabis plant are
intertwined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where we're going to
stop for today.
