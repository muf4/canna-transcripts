[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good afternoon, friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruising in beautiful Boise, Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fall is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, take you on a walk on the bike path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the beautiful Boise River.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, a friend of mine is going to
join us, Shango Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talk about things in regenerative
agriculture and see what he's up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just wanted to say hey and
welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if any you got something dying to ask,
feel free to shoot it on now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We miss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask again.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here at the beautiful time of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about to be sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a bit cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you if it's good morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Benny Botanics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rainy day in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone was just asking about pears.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time of year, pears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pears are probably ripe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we call that fermented fruit juice
when you use ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you can be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fermented fruit juice is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like FPJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you use it more for ripening your crop
than you use it for general use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't use that ripe fruit for a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the natural farming process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of limited use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, what a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's gonna be a fun spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regenerative conferences and windy,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll stop walking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy the ducks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, EC Island Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so you might use FFJ, that ripe
fruit ferment for something towards the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for ripening or finishing off less
for the general use or all the time use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was just asking about pears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something we don't use all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that wind better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so hanging out and really excited to
invite a friend on the show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to talk story and yeah, definitely
want to hear your guys's questions as
[SPEAKER_02]: always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in fall and winter, one of the
things that people really struggle with is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the IMO one collection if they're
behind or don't have one on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome out there and quite quite glad to
hear you're taking advantage of the
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible growing conditions out there.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so my buddy Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in California today?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I am here on Vashon Island in
Washington State today, packing up getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to head out to Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it raining?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always raining this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take the rain just so long as it's
not snowing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I figure if it's going to be
cold or out here in Boise, if it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be cold, I want the snow so the kids
can play in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you and I have got
different drives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I don't have kids, I'm not looking
to give them that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking to keep my shoes dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes for a very different snow
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scraping it off the car is not fun either.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shango, I hope that everybody that's
following me is following you,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys aren't following or don't
know who Shango is, definitely give him a
[SPEAKER_02]: follow as he's talking all the time with
some incredible people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am host and founder of Shaping Fire
and the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it started out as a podcast because I
was reaching out to the people who I was
[SPEAKER_00]: most interested in the industry to ask
them the questions that I thought were
[SPEAKER_00]: missing from the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost you just for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I interview people on my show and I ask
them the questions I think that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: missed in the general cannabis
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then much to my pleasure, a YouTube
channel spun off of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I go to so many events and I see
other good speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just go ahead and record them and
put them on my YouTube channel over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the podcast that's audio only
that comes out at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this YouTube channel that's kind
of taken off, it serves like 50,000 unique
[SPEAKER_00]: people a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like over 150 videos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me talking with other cannabis folks and
then just stuff that I see that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what I tell people is that
if I see it, you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, but today it's not about like
us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today it's about the regenerative
conference that Joshua and, oh wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: before I move on, let me make sure I plug
episode number 35, because Chris was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had great conversations, about 90
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's especially good for people who
are either new to K&F and making ferments
[SPEAKER_00]: or also folks who they've jumped in,
but they really want a re-approach of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: On episode 35 of Shaping Fire,
Chris really breaks it down of why we do
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff that we're doing instead of
just focusing only on recipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he certainly gives recipes during
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's understanding the why behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a good context to do your
creative work with your plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, but today we're really here
to talk about the regenerative conference
[SPEAKER_00]: that Joshua and Leighton have put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's coming up and people are
talking about it, people buying their
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm really excited to go to
both the Humboldt event and the Mission
[SPEAKER_00]: Again event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are like, oh,
it's the same speakers in the same city
[SPEAKER_00]: and if I live in one of these cities,
why would I go again?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you think, oh, I've heard that
speaker, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard you many times,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I hear you, whether it's on
my podcast or somebody else's podcast or
[SPEAKER_00]: live or whatever, I'm always getting new
stuff from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only do you have hours and
hours of knowledge to share with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also you're constantly learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an active learner yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I love when I come to an event and
you're all like, okay, so here's some
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline stuff, but here's what I'm
excited about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to encourage people to,
if you're into regenerative agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're into living soil, if you care
about the rhizosphere, if you're into
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, do what you can to go to these
kinds of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, I'm flying to Michigan on my own
dime to go to it, to see it a second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every time I catch one of these
conferences, I learn so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Chris, why don't we kind of use you
for an example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've got like, or they,
they've got like eight or nine speakers
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody's kind of got their,
oh, this is what we did last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: this we're going to do this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why don't we take you as an example,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you talk about what you're going
to talk about this year and why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: different than last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, we're all here in
service of regenerative agriculture and we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to encourage people to go to the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to be shy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to come out and be part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you planning for this year
that is not what you did last year,
brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the speakers I've talked to,
everybody's got that approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are excited about new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're excited about what they've done in
the last year and how things are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think of any industry in our country
right now, the cannabis world has some
[SPEAKER_02]: drastic changes and discoveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell people all the time that aren't in
the industry and the cannabis industry at
[SPEAKER_02]: home, the greatest botany work of any
generation is in the cannabis world and
[SPEAKER_02]: the discoveries and genetics and things
people have learned in that in the last 50
[SPEAKER_02]: years is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, Josh and Leighton and I talked
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I like about
this conference is the hope or the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that this serves to better the farmer and
those that are in the industry to really
[SPEAKER_02]: equip and give tools for people to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My part to play is in the natural farming
and helping people understand but also
[SPEAKER_02]: succeed in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I see just in a
lot of interactions is people struggle
[SPEAKER_02]: with understanding but also implementing
the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This idea of collecting indigenous
microbes from your local area and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: it to go to work in your growing
environment for better production and
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to assume, hopefully
not too much, but assume that some people
[SPEAKER_02]: have heard of natural farming or have an
introduction to it and instead of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: staying there, you're making fun of my
beard, Brock.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, the talk you did with
Wendy and Suzanne and Joshua, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: was maybe tomorrow, yesterday morning,
you look like a Game of Thrones character,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was telling my family,
I asked my kids, are you all right if I
[SPEAKER_02]: shave my beard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I get tired of the maintenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might not be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we shave it off and make IMO with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the natural farming talk, we're going
to demonstrate and jump into IMO pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much wholeheartedly or for most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In each city, some of the people that have
taken my class that are proficient at it
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to do some prep work so that
people are coming and seeing IMO in
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these hot piles, smelling like baking
bread, what's going on in them?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can throw it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also just taking people through that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've been doing natural farming
for a bit or you're just starting,
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to do IMO well is really the
strength of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also not necessarily the easiest
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so helping people kind of get over
some of the learning curve and really do
[SPEAKER_02]: well with IMO making, I think it'll be a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some hands-on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can take stuff home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be really a deep dive into that
one part of the natural farming process,
[SPEAKER_02]: which for me as a farmer and for a lot of
people in the different crops they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, natural farming, if you have IMO,
you have really 80% of the benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nutrients, all this stuff,
LAD and FPGA is so important and people
[SPEAKER_02]: have so much success with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're not even trying IMO
because it seems a bit daunting or kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: intimidating to get started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to dissuade some of those
fears and really give people a hearty push
[SPEAKER_02]: or encouragement into really succeeding
with that whole IMO 1, 2, 3, and 4
[SPEAKER_02]: process, how to do it, where you bring in
high nitrogen if you want to prep for
[SPEAKER_02]: planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just kind of answer all those
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of time we can spend on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really touch that in the last
time I spoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it'll be pretty much a whole
new conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't know natural farming at
all or haven't had an introduction,
[SPEAKER_02]: go check out Shaping Fire in episode 35 or
check out my YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search Chris Trump and you're going
to get that introduction you need to not
[SPEAKER_02]: be lost at the Science of Regenerative
Cannabis Cultivation conferences this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point too that get the
information you need so you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though beginners are
absolutely welcome and embraced and
[SPEAKER_00]: usually at the beginning of folks talk,
there's a little bit to kind of give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some context and move you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not like 101 level stuff that
you get at most conferences, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of the conferences that you can
go to in cannabis, they will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: basic stuff when you're not looking at the
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not looking at the vendors and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is specifically an educational
conference where it's not about we want
[SPEAKER_00]: you to buy stuff from the vendors and we
also have speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hardcore intensive for people
who are nerds for this, people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate, people who really want to get
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is more like a 300,
400 level class for people who it's
[SPEAKER_00]: assumed you already have a base of
knowledge because we want to take you
[SPEAKER_00]: farther along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only for people who have
already started to wade in that they think
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming is important to them,
it becomes harder and harder to get legit
[SPEAKER_00]: information, especially harder to get
legit information in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of translate these skills
and the heart of it for these people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are already interested but they want to
refine their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, one more question on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about this IMO kind of
workshop that you're going to do within
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people that were there last year,
do you think it would be fair to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: last year you did kind of an overview of
natural farming and then you answered very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific upper level questions at each
conference, but then this year you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, instead of giving this upper
level thing and having the questions be
[SPEAKER_00]: very in depth, we are going to dive right
into this one area of natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you leave it, you want
everybody to feel comfortable and like
[SPEAKER_00]: they can run with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it'll be kind of specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: The geese are coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a beautiful time of day here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be narrower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of trying to introduce people,
assuming some people don't really know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't tell you how many people were
introduced to concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a lot of people excited about
what they were doing out of those
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative conferences last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year going kind of, there's not
enough time to go into everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do five day intensives here in Boise
and there's not enough time to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in 40 hours of education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the time we have at the
regenerative conference, this being the
[SPEAKER_02]: first for kind of where we're having the
conversation, we need to go deeper down
[SPEAKER_02]: these trails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Josh said deeper down the rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we kind of identified in
natural farming is if we can go down here
[SPEAKER_02]: and people's questions then are getting
kind of tangibly answered.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting to see things and we talk
about it in person while doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could that do to bolster and boost
people in their beginning of their journey
[SPEAKER_02]: with natural farming?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it'll be nerdy stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it doesn't exclude really all
the regenerative type practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So IMO is really in line with or kind of
of the same, it's nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all playing with the same rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we talk with other people doing
things in regenerative agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not only will we talk about the
specifics of IMO creation and using it on
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants and your soil or preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the concept of why this
kind of inoculation or this use of preps
[SPEAKER_02]: can give you a better product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get some great testimonies of
people that have been doing this now for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy's going to talk all about it,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just how much the processors are
excited about people using regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: processes, people using IMO because
they're getting a better product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that matters, especially as the
industry shifts and people are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a bunch of not so good or maybe,
I don't know, get into that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, as the need to set yourself
apart and your product apart from other
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the industry or just in general,
to have a name for what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important that the
quality is looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the biggest component from what I
see or my understanding and some of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who else will be talking is,
you know, what is your soil life like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so IMOs, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a really inexpensive and
effective shoe in to taking care of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial life in your soil and reaping
the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I watched the interview that you
did with Wendy and Suzanne with Joshua the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you joined a little late after the two
of them had already said what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do different this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to be pointed
out that everybody knows that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back this year and they're coming
to the same cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has got brand new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's difficult to summarize
other people's presentations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I watched the video enough to know
that for Wendy, she's bringing this new
[SPEAKER_00]: insight she's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by gosh, she's really taken to all
the natural farming stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she's taken to it like a bird to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whereas last year she was talking
more about basics because that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: she's at, she has dove in and is now going
to be talking more about separating facts
[SPEAKER_00]: from fiction with natural farming and
dispelling rumors that she's been hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: as people ask her questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also because she's a license
holder herself, she does have that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that you mentioned earlier about this,
the real brass tacks about being a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming grower and bringing those products
into your local market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's going to have a lot of really
great new information on how, like best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for natural farming,
but then also how to make it work in your
[SPEAKER_00]: real life and make it matter to your
business or your family, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Suzanne, Suzanne's all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a whole new list of pests that
she wants to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially all the hot ones,
because you know, now that we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: clones going back and forth across the
country, all these new pests are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're showing up in new parts of the
country that they haven't been seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as people's budgets get tighter,
because, you know, people aren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot of money in licensed cannabis
yet, a lot of these folks are being
[SPEAKER_00]: tempted to decrease their use of
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she'll be addressing a lot of concerns
that people who are trying to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis on a budget too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, she's always great for
talking about medicine because Suzanne's
[SPEAKER_00]: very much interested in making the end
consumable product as safe for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two of them went through and you
can watch that on the regenerative organic
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch that interview with you and
Wendy and Suzanne and Joshua.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Dutch Blooms page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a great gathering of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wendy really has, she's adopted these
things, but she's also, there's a point in
[SPEAKER_02]: use where there's intuitive understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically in natural farming,
I see that there's kind of a, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to do the recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden there's like,
oh, I get why this works and I can do this
[SPEAKER_02]: because I understand why that thing that I
might change could be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wendy's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it'll be really fun to hear how
this is affecting her business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hugely positive for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, coming and hearing a great grower
with, you know, a third generation grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, talk about that shift and how
it's affected their bottom line,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is, worth the cost of admission.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there is, there's a whole gambit
of these great speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can take all of it, you know,
this whole conference and put it together
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're not, nothing's in conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's what Suzanne does and,
you know, what we're talking about in
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: The healthier plant, the less susceptible
you are to disease and bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it'll be, it'll be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, so Shanga, you've been to a couple
of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your experience of the culture,
the feel of this place?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a few days, one thing I'm
excited about is I've freed up my
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of the conferences where it
was just tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to get there, be there for speaking
and then go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year I get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look forward to the side
conversations those really end up being so
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a lot of friends just from two
conferences now I've been to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, we talk outside of the
industry and yeah, it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's your experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hanging out and there's a hundred
like-minded people in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that feel like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing is it's nice to not
feel alone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all of us growers, we're so used to
you know, not necessarily talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people about it or just talking
online, but not actually getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: human connection that you get when you get
with, you know, your tribe in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no matter the location,
you're going to be pulling in all these
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, from like three,
four hours all around you and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together and it's, and it feels
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like, there's like lots of
smiles and hugs and people sharing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really good to pull it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel the energy rise in the room,
which of course for the speakers that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody jazzed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they play off that and you're all
learning together and kind of raising the
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the whole community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found a lot in Michigan last
year was that you find people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to ask a question and sometimes it's
about sourcing something or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about like a, you know, a query about some
kind of natural input they have and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll ask the question and then you
would respond to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then somebody else would raise their
hand and say, Oh, you're looking for this
[SPEAKER_00]: input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so they would share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these, these conferences create,
they create like a hub for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are, are the speakers like
downloading this information and teaching,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also there's cross pollination as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's tons of new like
friendships made people exchanging phone
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and email addresses and,
and planning to get together later to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to talk and actually the number
one thing I think came up last year was
[SPEAKER_00]: people continually wanting to get together
with their local people and start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about developing cultivars that were only
going to be from their part of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and then control the genetics because,
you know, once interstate commerce is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed, it's going to be California
versus everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for anybody who's not California,
now is the time to developing cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to keep the genetics
where you live, but people will develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: taste for that particular cultivar and,
and come to you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, Shango, I've been there at
the Portland, Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They was so, what you're talking about was
so evident.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, the excitement of this is my tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have community for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, legalization was much more,
I don't know if it happened that year or
[SPEAKER_02]: just the year before, but it was,
it was like for, for many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these people were veterans,
you know, the guys that have been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this for 40 years and were there with
seeds and knowledge to share and technique
[SPEAKER_02]: and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first time they'd come
together in an open forum in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a community spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the kind of buzz about that of like,
man, this is kind of surreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting down and you know,
this is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, that was, that was a lot of
fun to watch and to listen to the stories
[SPEAKER_02]: and to meet some of these people who have
kind of had to play be under the radar and
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody knows who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come to find out they're, you know,
they've been doing this well for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time and they have lots to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as much as they're speakers that are,
you know, valuable for their information,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also this community that I think
for, for a lot of farmers ends up being as
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable because of the knowledge drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're at it, the seeds as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause part of every conference is the seed
swap and you know, probably everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's watching is like into seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so it's a great opportunity to,
to meet people who are, who are producing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're, they're developing
cultivars that are good for where you
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like IMO, you want microbes that
are local growing plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: developed locally, which you weigh ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, you know, granted there's,
there's, there's one in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's all, but, but, but,
you know, Michigan and Maine are not in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt and the most of the country is
not in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for, for many of us growing seeds
from Northern California with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nine, 10 week finishes,
are not necessarily for everybody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why the Humboldt area is
the heartland of American heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the growing is so great there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but if you live in Portland,
Maine, or in Michigan, or even though
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's happening here on Bachelin
Island, even where I live in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest, you know, getting seeds made by
your neighbors that are proven to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: your outside conditions and, and plants
that like to eat the exudates,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like, like to give out the exudates
that your local microbes enjoy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a real leg up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's fun because, you know,
you get, you get cool stuff and your
[SPEAKER_00]: extras, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't necessarily have all that much
value to you, are super valuable and rare
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seed swap is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's exciting to watch Wendy,
you know, I mean, I, I didn't bring any
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, bringing macadamia net seeds to a
cannabis conference doesn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just didn't seem as important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll bring some this year and people
can plant a tree in their greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just watching the excitement as,
you know, I just sat next to one person,
[SPEAKER_02]: but watching as, as she had her,
her seeds, you know, that she was so happy
[SPEAKER_02]: to share because you have these extras,
you're never going to use them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't want to throw them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the excitement that people were like,
I get to, you know, have, and she's
[SPEAKER_02]: telling the stories about each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and yeah, that was, that was pretty
fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for me, as far as the conferences
go, that that was the excitement for me in
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland, just watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it was like, you know,
my kids walking into a taffy store where
[SPEAKER_02]: they got all those barrels and all the
different colors, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was above that level of excitement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, definitely bring something to
share and look forward to meeting some
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful people with their extras as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I was told to me,
so somebody asked me to, to trade some CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a woman and we were chatting and it
was, you know, it was towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said to me, she says, you know,
this is all great and I like regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, but honestly, the best thing
about this conference was for her to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: other women because there are more,
you know, the percentage of women growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in the regenerative part of cannabis is
larger than the rest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of pros
and bros science, but the regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil carrying from, you know,
rhizosphere and the microbes, it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: the percentage of women in growing this
way is much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so for, for women wanting to
connect with other women, that's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: really great thing because this,
this brings folks out where they can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: in a, in a, in a safe atmosphere full of
good folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, you know, traveling around the world
and, and going to, going to farms in
[SPEAKER_02]: Southeast Asia and all these places in the
U S we really need that to increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best farmers internationally
are women and, and in a lot of cultures
[SPEAKER_02]: and nations, primarily women.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think I couldn't, I couldn't
tell you why, but I think for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of reasons there, there's a,
a strength or, or a inherent talent that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually makes them better at caring for,
for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so, you know, not, not,
not knocking the guy farmers out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but I think there's something to be
said for, for really fostering that as we
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in culture and, and look at what the
future is for us as farmers in the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the last thing that I would
mention as far as the vibe of the event is
[SPEAKER_00]: that while there are certainly,
while they're certainly very intense
[SPEAKER_00]: information at a high level and lots of
people are taking notes, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: people writing everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very festive vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, it's a gathering of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke breaks are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the kind everybody's bringing
their, their A grade to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to share with each other and check
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and so it's a nice balance of
let's, let's get really focused and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but then also let's, let's enjoy each
other's company and all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like you said earlier,
well worth the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also when you think about the
increased quality of product you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put out and the increased value it has
both for your own health, and to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with your friends when you can say you're
implementing K and F techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the cutting edge of healthy
cannabis, it's, it's, it's good with your
[SPEAKER_00]: legal processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good if you're a patient processor,
wherever you are along the game,
[SPEAKER_00]: the future is not in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future is about a wild crafting and
taking care of your plants as nature
[SPEAKER_00]: intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you show up to the
courses, you're, you've chosen to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cutting edge and embrace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, invest a little in your self
and, and come out and, and join us all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango, so I saw a question just popped up
here from Laughing Shaman and thought it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this event we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, the best part is I can answer
that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest part is that I don't think
I've gotten the name of the event correct
[SPEAKER_00]: in two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, I'll quote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll quote it and then we can talk about
some places to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's the Science of Regenerative
Cannabis Cultivation Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mouthful and people are calling it
the Regen Conference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually, that's what I've been
calling it for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never actually learned the whole
name right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Regen Conference is a,
it's a seer, it's a traveling conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three locations left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County is coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that is, I think Humboldt
is like the 20, the 30th or the 31st to
[SPEAKER_02]: the 2nd.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 31st of February, 31st of January
2020.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then, and then after that,
it goes to Michigan just outside of Ann
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then the last one is in
Portland, Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind the conference is
that- Those are both in March,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so what's going on is that the
conference itself in theme is traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same speakers more or less will be
at the different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, the attendees will be
different and the questions will be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the idea is to pull together the
entire regenerative agriculture community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that everybody can up their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the website will be listed below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get buy tickets there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for sale now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to be missed because there's a
limited number of tickets available for
[SPEAKER_00]: every location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, you don't want to sleep on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go to the point that
we're selling out again this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there won't be tickets sold at the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get them in advance and you
want to get them before they're sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, Chris, do you know the website off
the top of your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write it on my notes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's
regenerativecannabisconference.com or
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, but you can pop over and check out
Dutch Blooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also an Instagram at
regenerativecannabiscultivation, I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: is the Instagram account that's dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you and I also both reposted the
little flyer for today for this talk we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put it on the bottom of the flyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's in my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to miss, but apparently we don't
know it for sure at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, laughingshaman posted the
link right there, the dot com
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative, organiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, well, well, Chris, thanks for
inviting me to join you so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: give some love to the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to seeing you both in
Humboldt and in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you know, just want to encourage
people to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing and you can't do wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thanks a lot for the invitation,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I look forward to spending more
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sorry to pop in and out of Ann Arbor
and not get to chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we will this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, thanks for watching that and hanging
out with my friend Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, total total blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good people and really, really sweet to
get to chat with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to meeting with you
guys and come up and say hi and know that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no no magical means of knowing what
your actual name is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I only know you through your Instagram
tag, so do introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, look forward to chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know there was some good questions
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't get to answer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys have a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go keep going with my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some more to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, thanks for watching,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to you soon.
