[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Colin is going to be talking about
biodynamic living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please put your phones on vibrate if you
haven't already done so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please hold your questions till the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's offer a well-earned welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's technically afternoon, but I'm sure
it still feels like morning because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to talk a little bit about
biodynamic agriculture, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: composting, how that fits into a
regenerative approach to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and agriculture in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely have plenty of time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I wanted to thank Erica Edwards,
aka TheStonePixie, for this photo on the
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis grown in fucal culture
approach inside of the greenhouse of Elk
[SPEAKER_00]: and Blue Farms in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the organic plants in the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just want to talk a little bit about
what it is that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farm is sort of a production approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about the soils and
different ideas about biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches or perspectives, how that fits
into the larger discussion, and go from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, how many people here are
familiar with biodynamic?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we got a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, biodynamic comes from the
root bio and dinos, which is this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: life and force, and that in everything
around us, especially in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: things work on this biological level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biological intelligence and
biological factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the dynamic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the energies and the rhythms
that we see in agriculture, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sap running through the trees,
the things we see associated with full
[SPEAKER_00]: moons, gravitational pulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This affects the depth that water goes
when you irrigate or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that interrelationship between
the dynamic approach to agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological approach and how these
synthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make compost two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a shot of our windrows in
Oregon, which isn't as clear with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our farm in California,
which is where we first started about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our approach was to try and identify how
we could make the best soil, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make the best compost known to
man, put it in a bag, and really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the farm to you and take all the
values of what one would want in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical, truly organic, and beyond organic
type of operation, but be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that available to people who don't have
cows walking around the front or back
[SPEAKER_00]: yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Boo, our spokes cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We adopted a cow for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, because we make our manure from cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of reasons for that,
but it has to do with organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: grass-fed, pasture-raised cows have this
12-day digestive cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time that that mother cow starts
eating and chomping on grass, it takes 12
[SPEAKER_00]: days for those enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, cows are a giant fermentation
vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a ruminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that we often call it a dairy
cow because we've put the highest monetary
[SPEAKER_00]: value on what milk is, but if a pound of
compost were worth more than a pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: milk, we might call it a fertility cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The milk is a by-product, but it's a poop
cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, we adopted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second reason was the year we started
our company, 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prior year, there was five dairy
farmer suicides in Fresno County,
[SPEAKER_00]: California alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stemmed from a lot of factors,
but one is the economic factors that when
[SPEAKER_00]: the prices keep going up and people aren't
willing to pay as much for the supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes unfeasible for people to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other generations don't want to go through
the struggles they're seeing their parents
[SPEAKER_00]: face, and more and more we see farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the proudest people,
dairy farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see this at the same time that there's
such a value to what cows can produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to bring attention to the role
that farmers play, that farms play,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, the cow plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little side note there, but if you
wondered why everything comes back to poo,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quickly the poop loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cows are eating on grass, and it's
grass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Oregon farms come from Oregon cows,
and the California farms come from
[SPEAKER_00]: California cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this play an important role?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you guys stick around for Jeff
Lohenfeld's presentation at 1.30,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll talk a lot more about
microorganisms, indigenous beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out and you're familiar with the
role that mycorrhizae plays in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the root system and the plant health,
there are indigenous, naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens through the fermentation
process through the cow manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we compost that cow manure,
the same profile of beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms that are found in
California are found in our compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a symbiotic relationship
between grasses and animals, and if
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody's familiar, and this is another
side note, I do a lot of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll have time for questions,
but how many people here are familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: John Wick and the Marin Carbon Project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total side note, but this guy right up the
road, maybe 30 miles from here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the subject of some of the most
cutting-edge research in the world on
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon sequestration, and what they found
is he saw the degradation of the pastures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw for a guy, bought a bunch of acreage
up in Marin, and somebody grazed it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cows came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were all these annuals and
perennials and local grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cows left, and all these thistles
came, and the grass came.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass looked like shit, literally,
and so he wanted to look at what was this
[SPEAKER_00]: role, and the soils were gradually getting
worse and worse, and depleted the carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so he teamed up with a soil ecologist,
Jeff Creek, and they did this research,
[SPEAKER_00]: and did a lot of control plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling them short, but quick
abbreviated thing is they decided in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the control plots to put down an
application of compost on the hillside to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to simulate range animals coming
through and pooping all over the land and
[SPEAKER_00]: eating the grasses, and he rented a herd
of cows for the summer and pastured it
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and what he noticed was all these
annuals and perennials came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stomped out this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon cycle that happened was just
incredible, and when he gave them back,
[SPEAKER_00]: when he gave these cows back to the
farmer, they had collectively the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: herd, collectively, had gained 5,000
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does this 5,000 pounds come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it came from this whole cycle of
grass and adding more through the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and through the fertility and
through the carbon sequestration and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pulling out of the atmosphere,
so to simulate this, they added us one
[SPEAKER_00]: application of compost the first year and
then didn't even do it the following year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what they noticed is not only was this
trend of depleted soils halted,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the soil started regenerating
themselves year after year after year,
[SPEAKER_00]: even without putting more compost down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total tangent, we're getting off on a side
thing, but these are all important because
[SPEAKER_00]: when you hear what is carbon
sequestration, you need to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: taking organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people here, if you're a farmer,
if you're giving cannabis and Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino or anywhere else, if you're
collecting woody biomass, track it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get the carbon credits right
now, you might not be getting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all these different bills are taking
place in Sacramento that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for benefits for removing woody
undergrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free carbon storage for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting it back in the soil,
and there's going to be an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to it down the future,
and if not, you're able to tell people
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're doing on your farm and
your carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you carbon neutral?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, quick poop loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cows are eating the grass, now we know
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking the manure, we're scooping it
up, we bring it across the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: pile it up, and we use a natural windrow
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want thermophilic composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the compost to exceed 133 degrees,
but not exceed 160.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: At 133 and above, you get a pathogen
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts killing off the weed seeds,
the E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, the salmonella, everything else like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We track the temperatures, of course,
because this has to do with airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: has to do with carbon nitrogen ratio,
has to do with the moisture in the aisle
[SPEAKER_00]: or lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, basically, it's the four variables,
earth, water, air, and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you build your compost recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 160 degrees, a lot of the beneficial
microorganisms start getting killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of composting places build
really big piles, get them really hot
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly to kill off the pathogens,
and then try to just put them in a bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them or tow them up or get them out
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They heat it to a 180 or 190 because they
get quicker throughput, but you've lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the living microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a bunch of nutrients out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants love it, but you're not
getting the same kind of diverse approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to build your soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a windrow to turning system to get
the homogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just essentially turns the pile inside
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to avoid the anaerobic core in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do this with a pitchfork or a
skid steer, depending on the size and
[SPEAKER_00]: scope of your own compost operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put biodynamic inoculants in the
pile and leave it unturned, which is when
[SPEAKER_00]: some weed seeds like to blow around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I get mad, is when they pull
them out and they got roots like that
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like they're robbing my
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if a pile, I can't get to it and it
gets wet and it gets over weedy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will actually just turn all the weeds
into the pile, add fresh manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of recycle it because I want the
nitrogen back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just interesting to see one
little thing above and below the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another little shot of the windrow turner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the piles at least 30 days for a
curing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is compost, much like wine or
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a stability and a maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that ammonia smell converts the
plant available nitrogen, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting a diverse microbiologically active
and alive soil, not looking for the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen kick that will get really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do people use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They mix it up, top dress, make compost
teas, rebuild your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erosion concerns, compost burns,
do wonders, and people use it to
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate, generating your on-site
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first thing, you are what you eat
whether you're a plant or a human being
[SPEAKER_00]: and not all compost and soils are created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a lot of your ag inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feedlot cattle, you know, when you see
steer manure, you know that's not organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if steer, male cows, are organic,
they're called grass bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means they're running around in the
field and nobody's following with a gooper
[SPEAKER_00]: scooper like they do in Central Park with
the horses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the only thing you're getting there,
steer manure, is locked up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a reflection of their living
conditions and their feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, some of these
feedlots are so bad that they take chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: manure, pelletize it, feed it to cows who
are natural herbivores, and then wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: why we get mad cow disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional ags, it's not so much just
the chicken manure, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just something you should know
and then you make your own judgments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may find a compost that's listed
as OMRI certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they want to rotate these
chickens through, they put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: container and they gas them in a chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about 10,000 chickens at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how they sort of retire the
chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those 10,000 dead chickens are
fed through a bark shredder and thrown in
[SPEAKER_00]: a compost pile mixed with some casino food
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you buy it as certified organic
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wonder why your cannabis
fails the sampling tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those gases used to kill the
chickens persist through the entire soil
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, cannabis cycle, testing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green waste, recycled inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in the compost, it just doesn't
magically come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get a kick out of the fact,
you know, these guys running through
[SPEAKER_00]: hazmat suits and selling it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know your feedstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how things are separated or not and
what the contaminants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is always an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be looking for a thermophilic
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference between something in
California that's labeled as composted
[SPEAKER_00]: versus something you find somewhere else
that might not call it compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they call it composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they call it aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aged manure is something just old shit
that was put in a pile and just left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some breaks down, some doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a presence of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if it hasn't been managed,
if it's had a lot of anaerobic activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find a lot of harmful
microorganisms the same way you find
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your gamble in terms of what,
you know, outweighs what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that starts not too
wet, not too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody here building their own soils,
your own compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it, you know, just something
where you can't, it's not so wet that it
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezes out of your hand, but not so dry
that the dust just falls off your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a good finished pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in the summer, it's good to use
micro sprinklers or wet material to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want a good mix of your feedstocks
to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say one of your approaches
should be what do you have the most of
[SPEAKER_00]: around you and then build your recipe from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is important based on the quality of
compost you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other factor for those of you making
your own soils, how much time do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to devote to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to devote a lot of time,
pick a method of composting, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: based around how much time you have and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got time and you got equipment,
go for aerated piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're rotating your piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're turning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that goes through a
thermofilic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build the pile that way and then
let it go to maturity and start another
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of time or space,
build your pile accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what's called a static thermofilic
pile, where you're going to pile a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff up and leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a compost pile breathes from the
bottom and goes up, you need to add for
[SPEAKER_00]: air, compensate for airflow on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either build it on top of pallets,
add a bunch of sticks on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pile, and then build your pile on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull the sticks out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is not to get those sticks to
turn into beautiful crumbly compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is the sticks allow for porosity
in the pile and airflow throughout it so
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so your mesophilic bacteria are
breaking down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting a lot happens on the surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have a good amount of
surface area, not too much because then
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulk density doesn't allow it to
breathe, but enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good composting techniques, you can
sometimes rent a chipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you have a good amount of
woody biomass, one day renting it from
[SPEAKER_00]: your local rental place makes a whole lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller piles, you can use methodologies
where you stick straw or things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a 55-gallon drum and a weed whacker
with a blade on it and put your material
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and put the weed whacker in and
chop it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've broken up a lot of that
material and you've made it more readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available for breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of kind of home
techniques that you can use for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: composting, but all up to the maestro,
Jeff Lowenfels, come and talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing your own composting,
pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun to look at your pile,
kind of see what you have going through
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but understand the role that the soil
food web plays in your composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start seeing this,
you start looking at the process
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who have those composting
drums, and this is typically for home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners because somebody got them to buy
one of the drums and it's always wet and
[SPEAKER_00]: sludgy and they can't figure it out
because they're always putting new wet
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on top of old compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a one pallet system at home
and you keep piling and adding and adding
[SPEAKER_00]: and adding, it will never fully finish if
you keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the easy thing then is build a two or
three system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do it out of pallets and
string them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just use a simple carabiner in the
front to open up the pallet and get to
[SPEAKER_00]: your pile and turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start one and turn it and then when it
gets to a certain height, start your next
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: General rule of thumb for home composters
is for firma field composting to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need at least one cubic yard of mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three foot by three foot by three foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody's doing home composting,
just think about that in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need at least that much mass to have
enough for temperatures to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in biodynamics, we really kind of look
at this as ideal as this closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: system where everything's generated on
site and nothing else leaves the farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything flows together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the ideal in biodynamic
and regenerative agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculture and ecological design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do what we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of these factors to
consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever heard of the soil food lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it came from,
but you'll be learning more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of these things in striving
for building good organic soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what your limitations are and
work throughout them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to be growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing strictly cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing mixed crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing cannabis, could you grow
some mixed crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you do companion planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing other crops, how do you
want to integrate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to plant close to one
another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Work with your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strains have different
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it going to take to flowering
from start to finish?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the different conditions that are
going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially here in the Bay Area,
the Bay Area is completely comprised of
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, what's the sun
art?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the fences in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the traffic situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that I mean foot traffic because
there are pet paths that take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the real ecological system that you
have within your own sort of yard or
[SPEAKER_00]: growing situation and how can you
integrate things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing it in ground or you're
doing raised beds, fabric pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing different coverages?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what you want out of it will
determine a lot of your strategies going
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to do the most ecologically
responsible thing, but always be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your limitations in terms of
design, equipment, space, considerations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nature's role in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain, you know, it flushes nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is your design?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do terracing if you're on a slope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you add where one nutrients are going
to flush and rebuild another area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you're doing this year should
already give you an idea of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plant in the same place
next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: If nutrients are washing downhill,
can you design something this year so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can plant there next year and harvest
those nutrients for an entire year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Build your own biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold, and there are different patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the role the temperature
plays in your soil and plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: or getting too hot for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun, these are just some other factors
of those different things, and airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who grows without a soil test,
it's just, it bothers my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this comes in this,
I'm in the soil industry, a package of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody wants to sue you for damaging
$40,000 worth of crops on a $4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase because they didn't spend 40
bucks on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The math is mind-boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understand the value of a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just lets you know what you're starting
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas is another big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use those for top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use those for teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backpack sprayers are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge fan of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of certain types of
sprayers and brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand there's a
relationship between the microbiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of time that you brew and the
force and pounds per square inch that go
[SPEAKER_00]: through because you're dealing with living
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a scientist, but I think the
airflow that's required to pump through a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand gallon compost tea brewer would
be too high a PSI to allow all microbes to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a huge fan of applying compost
teas within 24 hours because if you build
[SPEAKER_00]: your compost tea recipe to have as much
diversity, you're going after diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: and not necessarily reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start introducing food
sources to go beyond 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're now introducing competition or
exclusion or maybe some microbes aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: just fond of molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it is organic hybrids and
molasses, I'm not a huge fan of molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already, some of that diversity can
be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's a diversity of food
sources you can add, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it's a different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be restricted here,
but we're a huge fan of building recipes
[SPEAKER_00]: for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're much more bacterially diverse,
so good fungal sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute wonder between the Malibu
and a high quality worm casting as your
[SPEAKER_00]: base and then tea it up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But drenches and foliars and feeding it
with weekly at the Vegetative Growth
[SPEAKER_00]: Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trenching is great when you do your
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take your plant, you're going
to dump the roots and then do your
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant, you're coating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving it a coating with the soil,
with microbes, you're adding food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving it sort of a comfort zone
and an immediate sort of care package,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, while it goes and transfers
into this new environment and kind of has
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out where everything is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar feeding is phenomenal, especially
if you get powdery mildew outbreaks or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then discontinuing, finally,
foliar, especially due to moisture issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a probiotic earth box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different way of growing and using
compost and doing top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing your own blending?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you recharging soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a methodology for your spent
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless, of course, you're doing no-till
living organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this boggles my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things I say,
okay, we'll sell you soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be cutting your soil bill
by like 60% next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be the thing for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have people grow the soil,
dump it out back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it with a microgreens guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, all we got to do, we'll sell
you this little thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of agree good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this will take a lot of money
out of our pocket, you know, rather sell
[SPEAKER_00]: your truckloads every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, really, you've got this stuff
sitting out back and nothing's wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just love this, you know,
but adding worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put in this to your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to build a worm bin and it's
going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to make Monsanto pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different ingredients that you
can put in your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are things to think about
between biochar and different
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're building your own compost pile,
why not put it in a compost pile and
[SPEAKER_00]: upcycle it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Building your own recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's funny when a lot of people
come to you and this, whether it's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: store or something, but they find
something on the internet, they got 117
[SPEAKER_00]: different amendments, or they're coming
with a balanced all breath method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes it's over complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start from a simple place that you can
understand and go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially we love this third of a
compost, third of a pea, something to
[SPEAKER_00]: aerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can add a couple simple
things, you know, add it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporating your topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's indigenous microorganisms
that are going to go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understand that it's this living
microbes that's taking that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to look at your NDK
other than just on a number system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the compost, the worms, the
inoculants, understanding what's in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely should have some type of
integrated pest management system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even whether you're growing indoor,
outdoor, I always like to plug Rincon
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitova.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our go to sources for
beneficials available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have just millions and millions of
things in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little before and after of powdery
mildew and just what a simple compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: can do despite the fact that we're not
allowed to say that it does anything
[SPEAKER_00]: related to pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't tell you that compost tea does
anything to affect powdery mildew or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesters and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just tell you that sometimes you put
it on your plant and the stuff goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you definitely for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to be a resource, especially for
home compost, for soil blenders,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're building your own thing,
whatever your situation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of different events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some free samples up here in the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can quickly open the bag or the box,
but this is just to make your own compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple sample here, but I'll throw
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a place to start,
but it's a cotton muslin tea bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drop it in a five gallon bucket of
water, let it soak overnight and put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say the word aerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say the word foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't say the word stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all like level 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil food web nerds would term this a cold
water compost tea extract because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: technically a brew, but extracts are a
phenomenal way to start and you get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerators take it up a notch, but compost
tea doesn't need to be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just start with the absolute simplest
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrate that into your practices and go
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for a couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I come down to California for work,
I grab the Malibu compost and drive it
[SPEAKER_01]: back up with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting when you said
the microbes are indigenous to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: live, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question though is I bring it back up
for small patient rows, not for scalable
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for people who are in their heart,
they're really probiotic, but they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to make sure that I set them up
as simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Malibu compost is so alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say is the potency lasting
time where a bag could be purchased?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still going to be as potent next
season or is it really just like six
[SPEAKER_01]: months?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very, very great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is we're talking about the life cycle
of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is challenges that we face with
bagged soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third is your good friends and
patients in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the Washington thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say buy Malibu compost in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll truck it up there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you all the nurseries and garden
centers in Washington that it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting it then in Washington or
Oregon, it's coming off our Oregon farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a different microbial profile
for those Oregon and Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses than there are, you know,
California is part of that Mediterranean
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just, again, different annuals
and perennials that they're digesting on a
[SPEAKER_00]: purely microbial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't have to drive it as
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just see really, really,
and I wish someone else had more money for
[SPEAKER_00]: research to compare our California compost
and Oregon compost and look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how pasture management really
plays through from one end to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbial cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people debate a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody says how much do the
microbes die off?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good portion of microbes go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a dormancy cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they don't get adequate air and
moisture, they go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like a barren hibernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the idea of that when you're
adding a dried compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do our tea bags, we take our
compost, we lay it out on screens and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the microbes to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to use a heat
process because that'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them essentially go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, if I put Malibu compost in a
cotton tea bag, it eats through the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a food source and they're
still wide awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add it to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all kind of groggy, but they just
got moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start waking up and then you add
air and everybody's like got water and
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're ready to just go out and find
their own food and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bag, they're already really,
really living.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our biggest thing is people store the
product outdoors over winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nurseries are mismanaged inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always want things to be essentially as
fresh as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a vast majority, and I hear anything
from die-off or occurs between 3% to 23%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what it is, but I just know
if there's 50 billion living
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms in here and four billion of
the 50 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 46 billion living organisms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got a few guys who are going to do
some good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with bagged soil, sometimes if someone
had something that sat for a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: we tell them take it outside, kind of
fluff it up, let it sit out in the air in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun, kind of reawaken and recharge and
just get some air and then be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, if it's just kind of gone
dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let some of the experts attest to
the total die-off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people talk about it with compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they start dying at 18 hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they die at 24 hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many go dormant?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're grooming, you're keeping
everybody as alive as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's in a package, they just sort of,
some will die off, but the vast,
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority is going dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Largely, a lot of it is anecdotal because
we just haven't had the chance to do as
[SPEAKER_00]: many of those different controlled trials
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen people grow in straight
compost and the plant grows, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just way too many things that are
inevitably going to be laid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have more than 10% compost in
your blend, you're not, anything lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than 10%, you're not really going to gain
any of the benefits of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like up to a third of your
mix is about kind of that top mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend somewhere between 20
to 30% of a compost blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using your home compost,
it might be different because it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be 100% broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got good organic matter that's
not broken down, but that can fulfill the
[SPEAKER_00]: function of some type of aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I build a potting soil, I want 25%
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm adding like a blend of pea,
cocoa, fir bark chips, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have replacement for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those components might be in your own home
unfinished compost, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our application would be more big add.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot less than 10% of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, now big add is a completely different
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that has to do with your
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you tilling it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you tilling it into the top of the
surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just, are you doing it in
conjunction with planting cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a chop and drop technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you apply the compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the late fall and when you're
letting the rains come in like a vineyard
[SPEAKER_00]: approach does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick plug, next weekend in the Presidio
is the first international biodynamic wine
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a panel there of compost,
but there's incredible research going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and what a lot of these regenerative
practices are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there, I hate to say it depends,
but the larger it depends on your
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is your year after year
cultivation strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only answer is what are you going
to do next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to invest in a heavy
application this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can feed it with a quarter inch
application next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll get to an annual application
instead of doing the semi-annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find alternative sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as that carbon trend starts to turn
around, how are you employing cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's where it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is you want to import less
and less and less material and regenerate
[SPEAKER_00]: as much material as you can on your own
land, even if that's growing mass that
[SPEAKER_00]: then can be added back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have somewhere where all summer
long you can start grabbing woody
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonaceous materials so you can compost
it over the winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you add some of the woody stuff as a
sheet that you can add compost on top and
[SPEAKER_00]: a cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let winter break that down for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do the composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it occur at the surface level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly now all those worms and
everything are just feeding off that top
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, that's a great approach
because you can use these living top mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: layers and feed from the top down and not
have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I go back to again once
you plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to plant in the same spot
next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you watering in between where you have
cannabis planted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to do the drip irrigation
because it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But others would say that without
irrigating in between the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're losing all the quote unquote
biological intelligence that's available
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, watering in between makes
everything have higher water hold
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, greater nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots can go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to build if you're doing a
trench system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe after two years you move the
trenches and you take that as pathway and
[SPEAKER_00]: you make this as trench.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe then your pathways are becoming
mulch ways for the first two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're building a lot of that mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, everything's golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really where this strategy and
it doesn't matter whether it's a backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: or a big ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vineyards, they plant the vine and it just
stays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, you can pull it out,
put another one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rotate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do in-ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing fabric pots, you can pile
soil around the fabric pots and the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will go through the pots and you're
improving it that much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what the situation is,
you look at expanding that and building
[SPEAKER_00]: year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank Collin Riley from Malibu
Compos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
