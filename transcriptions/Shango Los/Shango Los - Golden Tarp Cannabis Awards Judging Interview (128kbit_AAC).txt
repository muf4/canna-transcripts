[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are here with Shingalos,
and we are super excited because he came
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way down from Washington to see
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a podcast called Shaping the Fire,
and he is the founder of Vashon Island
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enthusiasts Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really long name, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us the abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, the podcast is
actually Shaping Fire, not Velfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Vashon Island Marijuana
Entrepreneurs Alliance was a trade
[SPEAKER_02]: organization that started about five years
ago when medical was still in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did is we found that so many
of the growers on the island were just
[SPEAKER_02]: selling against each other on the island,
and so the prices were crashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had really great prices on our island.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recognized this because my friends
were all growers, and I said, let's
[SPEAKER_02]: organize and start creating a channel to
dispensaries all around the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the farmers started working together
and group buying soil and nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody was happy because their
prices went down, and the amount they got
[SPEAKER_02]: for their flower went up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, though, everything's
changed now because they killed medical in
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, tried to roll it in so far
unsuccessfully into recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of those heritage growers had
to make a decision about whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted to just stop being in cannabis
or if they wanted to go back to a black
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really hard decision for
anybody to make when this is something
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been doing your whole life,
and it's why your kids can go to summer
[SPEAKER_02]: camp, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've got this extra money.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that transition like when you
talk about this heritage transition to
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of touch on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, originally, when the laws got
passed, they promised all the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: people that they would have an opportunity
in the licensed cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were pretty skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They promised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, promised, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, what happened is that
when it finally came time to get out the
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses, almost none of them were
original heritage medical people,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just a handful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a real travesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were more interested in giving the
money to higher capitalized folks from
[SPEAKER_02]: other industries when they were making
their qualification choices, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what they did is they took a
pre-existing, it could use some more
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation, but it could, a pre-existing
market with professionals who already had
[SPEAKER_02]: the relationships, set them all aside,
and then installed this whole new system
[SPEAKER_02]: with all new people from other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those companies hired medical
folk, but this is trying to make good out
[SPEAKER_02]: of a difficult situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who were with us through
the dark times and through prohibition,
[SPEAKER_02]: who put in all the real work over the
decades, most of those folks got pushed
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that affect your community?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it affect it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where I live on Vashon, we went from
having 156 small businesses that are all
[SPEAKER_02]: run by families to having four larger
licensed operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who run those operations on
our island, they're actually very nice
[SPEAKER_02]: people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the fact that so many people were
pushed out and were no longer included,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since they're the people who
made cannabis what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar to what we're
experiencing in the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I noticed yesterday the news that
they removed the one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that's going to do to shape
California cannabis is astonishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the protections for artisan growers,
for specialty folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small type family farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're going to be supplanted by
these bigger folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the idea to give them five years
to get the market set for artisan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really, really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish that they had at least given
us the five-year head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it was why a lot of my family
and friends decided to go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, stepping from the black market
into a transparent world is really hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's all you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to go back,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having that cap or the five-year
limit would have been really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, we really love what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you not only educating the
consumer, but also trying to organize
[SPEAKER_00]: groups to kind of help the people who,
that's all they've ever known,
[SPEAKER_00]: stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protecting the integrity of the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers need somebody to defend them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I am not a grower myself,
but all my friends are growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it would be a good opportunity
to help folks who, you know, growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they spend so much time with the plant,
they don't necessarily want to be out
[SPEAKER_02]: there in the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to be alone to do their
craft, right?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figure out, well, it's something I
can do to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only do they, you know,
the only thing that they've been doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, and they do it considerably well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're branding and becoming a
marketer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who do you sell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all these other facets
that have come into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really nice to hear that there
are people like yourself out there
[SPEAKER_00]: helping, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like this podcast is a
platform that you're using to get this
[SPEAKER_01]: information to your community and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about the podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the shaping fire podcast at
shaping fire dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every week I talk with some of the top
minds in international cannabis from Kevin
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodry, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on the show recently talking about
the history of CBD and where the original
[SPEAKER_02]: plants came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Dr. Ethan Russo talking
about the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profiles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every week, and also from down in
this area, Mean Gene has been on the show
[SPEAKER_02]: from Freeborn Selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every week I talk to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unlike a lot of podcasts, we're not
really personality based.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not profile episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a different topic area every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the person speaks to that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every episode is very educational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about educating the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been having this big conversation
about terpenes versus THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to touch a little bit on this
component?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I was sitting out there in the
judges room earlier, we were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: how helpful it would be for every consumer
to have this kind of a judging experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so challenging when you're
first getting into cannabis and we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: attracting all these new enthusiasts now,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they have to go and they
have to spend retail money to try one
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and then retail money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to build up your experience
like that if you're new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you come to something like this,
and I've got a whole bunch of samples in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll have a really good
understanding of what's going on in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, probiotic light depth in
Northern California by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be great that if anytime
anybody comes into cannabis, we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy your sampler pack so you can find
out, you know, what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be such a great entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's hard when you have to pay
your, you know, $10 to $15 a gram at
[SPEAKER_02]: retail just to learn what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be nice if we could access
cannabis medicine in that form?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our brains are all wired
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our experiences are all wired differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're arriving differently on an
individual level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I love that concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should push that forward
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your sample kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once we get a shirt, medical
insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the tribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome to the tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I was laughing about as I
was walking up to chat with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, is that, you know, normally when
you're at a party and you've got your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you're like, you don't want to
say, leave it on a table somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's judging so much that I'm like,
yeah, my stuff is safe right where it is
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the open.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, wow, it's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thrilled to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to sort of wrap things up,
is there anything else you want to throw
[SPEAKER_01]: out there in reference to just where we're
at with Golden Tarps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I heard that this set
really took a lot of effort to put
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were talking about all the effort
that the team and how long people have
[SPEAKER_02]: been here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably a good story behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really and truly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the package?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to head over to the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's go check on my sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
