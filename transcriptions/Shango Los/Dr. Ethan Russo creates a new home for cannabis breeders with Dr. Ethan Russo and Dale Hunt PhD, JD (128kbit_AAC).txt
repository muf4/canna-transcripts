[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there everybody I am here with Dale
Hunt and Dr. Ethan Russo here the day
[SPEAKER_01]: before Emerald Cup here in Santa Rosa and
I was very pleased that Dr. Russo reached
[SPEAKER_01]: out to me last week to let me know that
he's got a new project that he's very
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about and working on with Dale and
he said hey why don't you come by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Airbnb on Friday before the Emerald Cup
and we can talk about it today on video
[SPEAKER_01]: before they announce the new project
tomorrow at Emerald Cup so so guys thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you for the invitation and I was excited
to hear the bit I have heard so far about
[SPEAKER_01]: the new project I think Dale I think
you're gonna start it off by giving us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of context the the elevator
talk if you will about what the new
[SPEAKER_02]: project is okay well as you know I'm a
plant scientist who became a patent
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney and I've worked with plant
breeders for my entire career as I became
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more immersed in the cannabis
industry I had multiple conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders it would they would always follow
a similar pattern the breeder would tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me about something great that they've done
and asked me how I would go about
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting it and I tell them okay that's
easy I know how to do that and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: would get on to the steps and the process
and the cost and it would become evident
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were not in any position to pay
and even if they did pay they may not have
[SPEAKER_02]: the right opportunities business
opportunities to do anything with the IP
[SPEAKER_02]: once they had it after a few of these
conversations it all kind of went the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way I realized that what the industry
needs is something like a record company
[SPEAKER_02]: where the breeder is the singer the
songwriter the artist and you know if you
[SPEAKER_02]: think of a great musician they only have
to be great at being a musician they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be business people they don't have
to be good at the legal part they just
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be really good at what they do and
they have to have a passion for it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then a good record company takes care of
the rest and takes very good care of the
[SPEAKER_02]: musicians and keeps them happy and make
sure they get paid well on and on so I was
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking all right we have we have a
population of amazing breeders who've been
[SPEAKER_02]: just devoted to the plant in many cases
for decades and they are not being they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the right opportunities to get
their work out to people out to the world
[SPEAKER_02]: and so we want to do something that can
fix that we want to offer them
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities to protect their
intellectual property they would continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to own the intellectual property and then
this new venture that we're starting which
[SPEAKER_02]: we're calling breeders best is our way of
we become the licensee of the breeder and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we take that license and find the
right partners to cultivate the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: create the medicines to create the
products that can be made from these
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing cultivars that these breeders have
developed and then they get a royalty for
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as anyone is buying the plant or
the products or the flower or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is that they're buying all they have to do
is be good at breeding and it's our goal
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would take care of the rest one of
the things that I find really attractive
[SPEAKER_01]: about this business model is that the
ownership of the intellectual property of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant genetics stays with the original
breeder it doesn't change hands to you you
[SPEAKER_01]: are simply licensing into them instead of
you becoming the owner and so if I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it right if you ever find
yourself in a position where you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make royalties for the original
breeder that they can go ahead and take it
[SPEAKER_01]: and go on to their next venture with it is
that do I have that understanding correct
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I think and that may be different
from the model of at least some record
[SPEAKER_02]: companies I think they do end up acquiring
the rights I don't know who ends up owning
[SPEAKER_02]: the copyright it's probably depends on the
company but we I think it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important that the breeder continue to own
the IP we're in a in an industry in a
[SPEAKER_02]: culture where there are a lot of trust
issues and it's it's just it erases one
[SPEAKER_02]: potential question one potential problem
we will do our will will do great with the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to have a license to their IP
but if we don't find a good a good outlet
[SPEAKER_02]: for it or we don't we're not able to meet
the minimums that we build into the
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement then that will revert back to
them the rights so the ownership will
[SPEAKER_02]: always be with them but the rights would
revert back to them and they could do
[SPEAKER_01]: something else with it so Ethan I know you
have been a big proponent for a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine for all time and and as as
we see pharmaceutical companies coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: contact with the canvas plant more they
seem to be reverting to these solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: that are all single molecule breaking up
the plant taking it into its discrete
[SPEAKER_01]: parts and then kind of making a cocktail
and hoping that they can get FDA approval
[SPEAKER_01]: for it and and you've never really taken a
shine to that approach would you explain
[SPEAKER_01]: for us why it's so important in your eyes
to work on whole plant medicine to the
[SPEAKER_01]: degree that that you're taking on this big
project with Dale sure well I felt for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years that the real key to botanical
medicine medicine from plants the strength
[SPEAKER_00]: of it lies in the synergy the boosting of
ingredients what's come to be known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect so this is the idea that
we have soloists to carry on the musical
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy perhaps THC and CBD their medical
attributes are greatly enhanced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: addition of these other components in an
extract say from the plant as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecules so for example CBD is a
great medicine but what we're finding is
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain indications like treating
seizure disorders or schizophrenia that
[SPEAKER_00]: huge doses are necessary and this poses
two problems one is cost and availability
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other is the possibility of drug
drug interactions at these very high doses
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm fond of saying there's nothing that
cannabidiol does that isn't enhanced by
[SPEAKER_00]: having at least a little bit of THC with
it not to mention the enhancements that
[SPEAKER_00]: can come from a full panoply of terpenoids
that can contribute to the beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and also reduce any side effects
of other cannabinoids so this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that I've always espoused on as
you mentioned we're seeing divergence in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry where many companies are
going in the other direction and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make CBD isolates or worse in my opinion
trying to teach yeast how to make this in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab on right now I think the science
is fascinating but to scale that up
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to end up with a very
expensive product no doubt and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: never have the breadth of capabilities
that a properly constituted cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract will and I firmly believe that so
let's talk about that goal of that that
[SPEAKER_01]: full-bodied cannabis extract for a moment
because you know we understand what single
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule concoctions would be like but
then when we talk about whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine I don't have as clear as a
picture and certainly many of us are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know full ethanol extractions and and
we've been using that for a wide wide
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of ailments especially cancer
patients for years now in the underground
[SPEAKER_01]: right so so is it that is it that same
kind of picture that that we'd be using
[SPEAKER_01]: these new plants for essentially removing
the resin from the trichomes and using it
[SPEAKER_01]: as it is in the plant or that's just a
beginning place and then you process it
[SPEAKER_00]: from there well it could be processed but
really the key is having the genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: express the profile that you want for
maximum therapeutic effect and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the same thing applies to better
recreational concoctions you know if the
[SPEAKER_00]: question were do I think that we can make
better medicine or better adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I'm absolutely convinced of it so
I have an idea in my mind oftentimes of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the best biochemical profile would be
for a given condition or a given desired
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and what we're trying to do and
breeders best is see if we can make those
[SPEAKER_00]: available what we're seeing in the
industry is so a genetic bottleneck and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really a byproduct of prohibition
that for decades the premium has been on
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC to exclusion of everything else
what we've ended up with out there is
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily high THC products with high
mercy so very prone to produce couch lock
[SPEAKER_00]: but not optimal in any sense from
therapeutic standpoint especially say for
[SPEAKER_00]: the pain patient that might need to work
or study then not going to function well
[SPEAKER_00]: on that kind of profile then about 10
years ago CBD became popular as a target
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding but we ended up with high CBD
and high mercy creating the mistaken
[SPEAKER_00]: notion that CBD is sedating and it really
is not but we're really looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct targets emphasizing better
profiles perhaps T high THC with other
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinoids predominant that aren't going
to be sedating that allow people to
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate and work that can elevate mood
particularly in patients who have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic condition and may be depressed
from that additionally we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in what people now call minor
cannabinoids that haven't been available
[SPEAKER_00]: and haven't had the opportunity to show
their full therapeutic potential and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just would cite cannabigerol CBG as a
cannabinoid that I think is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: promising from a medical standpoint and
the vast majority of people that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: used cannabis for decades have had no
exposure to it so we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: before when you've been on the podcast
that you see many pharmaceutical companies
[SPEAKER_01]: moving towards these single molecule
solutions and and when you when you review
[SPEAKER_01]: their final product you're like so this
combination may be good but our goal
[SPEAKER_01]: really should be to breed a plant that is
exactly that so that instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing it in a lab we're just going
to grow this plant and then extract from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that the whole the entirety of
the oil and then and then you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do additional manufacturing you know
put it in a capsule or whatever and and
[SPEAKER_01]: and hand it on to the patient what types
of plants are you looking for for breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: to start bringing you right because I'm
sure that you know there are breeders who
[SPEAKER_01]: are who have got their life work right you
know in the grow room and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't felt safe to take it anywhere and
so now you know perhaps they'll consider
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders best as an option but how do they
know whether or not that they should even
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to you what are you looking for
sure well you know the place to start does
[SPEAKER_00]: not just that hey I've grown something
that I think is really good we need a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more science behind it and that
comes from COA certificates of analysis so
[SPEAKER_00]: on a basic level what we'd be looking for
is either THC predominant CBD predominant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants but with profiles other than
hindmercine so we're interested in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have a good expression of other
terpenoids whether cariophylline,
[SPEAKER_00]: linolule, limonene, pinene any of these
would be of interest and then certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: type 2 plants with a balance of THC and
CBD with the same kind of profiles CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant plants and THCV predominant
plants or by chance if somebody has a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabichromine CBC predominant plant
that's a recessive gene don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it normally so any of these would be of
great interest and would be very promising
[SPEAKER_01]: in future commerce so Dale let's say that
somebody is watching and they have one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants something that's got unique
characteristics that kind of generally
[SPEAKER_01]: falls within the boundaries that Dr. Russo
is explaining to us what would it look
[SPEAKER_01]: like so I'm assuming that we'll give them
the contact information at the end so they
[SPEAKER_01]: may contact and you talk with them what
would be the steps of kind of bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: them in so that we can give people a
picture of how they'd be treated yeah well
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all we have to I have to tap into
expertise that is not mine it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan's and some other people that we're
going to involve to be able to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: confidence that that this particular
genetic combination has a lot of promise
[SPEAKER_02]: we're a new company we're still you know
pre-funding and so we won't be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw massive resources at everything that
comes our way we'll have to focus on a few
[SPEAKER_02]: of the very most promising at first as we
learn how to walk and then run but yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea is if we if we find something
that seems interesting then we would we
[SPEAKER_02]: would and it would be would have been
submitted by the breeder in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place so they've expressed some interest
we would go back to them and say yeah it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like this is something we want to
work on with you we will file provisional
[SPEAKER_02]: patent protection none of this is at any
cost to them we'll file provisional patent
[SPEAKER_02]: protection this will give us a year to you
know the breeder's name in the breeder's
[SPEAKER_02]: name absolutely it'll always be in the
breeder's name and owned by the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: but during that provisional year we would
have an opportunity to evaluate it more
[SPEAKER_02]: thoroughly evaluate it chemically and
horticulturally to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_02]: really is viable as a real plant that you
can put into larger scale production and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring to more markets more people if we
get through that well and then of course
[SPEAKER_02]: part of this is we make an we make an
agreement with the breeder the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: needs his or her own attorney if they need
help identifying an attorney or paying for
[SPEAKER_02]: it we wouldn't be the ones to try to
identify an attorney we want that to be
[SPEAKER_02]: completely independent decision but I
think there's some there are some very
[SPEAKER_02]: good attorneys and the International
Cannabis Bar Association has some good
[SPEAKER_02]: ones to choose from that are completely
independent of us but we would make an
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement that would specify a royalty
rate and the other things that need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: specified so that they have confidence
that they have the right kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: protection and their attorney gets to
review that and make sure that they get
[SPEAKER_02]: advice telling them that yeah this is this
is not biased in their favor this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fair deal both ways and then we go to work
evaluating it if after that first year or
[SPEAKER_02]: sometime during that first year it looks
like it's a go then we would do a more
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term definitive agreement with
guaranteed minimum annual royalties a
[SPEAKER_02]: specified royalty rate and full IP
protection again in the breeder's name did
[SPEAKER_02]: you say guaranteed minimum royalties yes
now what that's pretty massive yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed that that can sound imprudent a
guaranteed minimum royalty I've done a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of plant licensing and what you do with a
guaranteed minimum royalty in most of
[SPEAKER_02]: these situations is you you're telling the
breeder or whatever the partner is we
[SPEAKER_02]: think that we can with our diligence that
we can produce enough revenue that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: pay you this as your royalty and hopefully
a lot more than that if we ever don't then
[SPEAKER_02]: the exclusivity of our agreement goes away
and we become a non-exclusive licensee or
[SPEAKER_02]: in some cases we lose our license entirely
and all the rights revert back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder that's a way one of the things
I've learned in doing intellectual
[SPEAKER_02]: property licensing is if you give someone
an exclusive license to something whether
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a plant variety or whatever thing you
have you're betting on them to do all the
[SPEAKER_02]: work and that's a risk and if you but if
they'll make them if they'll give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed minimum then they're they're
putting some skin in the game and they've
[SPEAKER_02]: got to they've got to do the work they've
got to make it happen and then if things
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't turn out the way they thought
it would and you know then the way to back
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that in a way that's that's not
doesn't doesn't have to be combative or
[SPEAKER_02]: adversarial is to say you know we're sorry
we're not going to be able to maintain the
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusivity of these rights we we can't
make enough money to pay this royalty that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean that the breeder is just left
with no options a breeder has intellectual
[SPEAKER_02]: property that belongs to them they've got
either still a non-exclusive license with
[SPEAKER_02]: us so we can still try to make money for
them and then they can also with since
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not exclusive they can go do what
they want to do also so I like I really
[SPEAKER_01]: like the fact that the ownership remains
with the original breeder which gives them
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more safety and and I'm both
surprised and think it's pretty cool that
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're approaching this minimum
royalty amount but you know in in this in
[SPEAKER_01]: this post-filos debacle world there's not
a lot of people thrown around trust right
[SPEAKER_01]: now when it comes to the breeding scene
right so so let's talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: about protections for the breeders
themselves the first year when when you
[SPEAKER_01]: wrap up the IP while you can do your due
diligence to make sure that that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really an appropriate target plant what
does that agreement look like what
[SPEAKER_01]: protections are in it for the breeder to
know that you're not I don't know swirling
[SPEAKER_01]: away the genetics and then you're gonna
say oh it's not the right plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: and they go away and then you go ahead and
use it anyway that's a great question
[SPEAKER_02]: typically a good intellectual property
license has audit rights where there's the
[SPEAKER_02]: the license or the one that owns the
rights has the right built into the
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement to walk in at any time and
inspect or have someone do that for them
[SPEAKER_02]: in addition one of the things that is I
think especially good or attractive about
[SPEAKER_02]: intellectual property licenses relating to
actual plant cultivars is that if someone
[SPEAKER_02]: ever tried to do something like that
you're a very simple DNA test away from
[SPEAKER_02]: proving that you know these guys that told
me they weren't keeping any of my plants
[SPEAKER_02]: kept some of my plants that's a super
super feasible test and this isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretical you've done this with a wide
range of other types of plants so this
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't like iffy science this is very clear
science absolutely clear and because there
[SPEAKER_02]: has been a lot of activity in cannabis
sequencing and cannabis mapping it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very accessible to this kind of genetic
testing I'm not saying it's it's cheap or
[SPEAKER_02]: over or it happens overnight but if if
anyone ever could work if they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: concern that that had happened it would be
impossible to hide it and so I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one of the reasons that that you
know it's great if you can ask people to
[SPEAKER_02]: trust you but it's even better if you can
say you don't have to trust me we're
[SPEAKER_02]: transparent here's your recourse here
you're up here here's how you are
[SPEAKER_02]: protected and you don't even have to
believe us you've got your own attorney to
[SPEAKER_02]: walk through this with you and hold us
accountable and I think transparency and
[SPEAKER_02]: accountability are essential in any any
business where where you want to engender
[SPEAKER_02]: trustworthiness it starts with
transparency and accountability Ethan you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I know you as a neurologist and a
cannabis researcher but also as a neighbor
[SPEAKER_01]: on bash on island where you're a serious
horticulturist horticulturalist and and a
[SPEAKER_01]: member of the fruit club and and you know
I know your perspective goes beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: law aspects and beyond just the medical
benefits you're a plant nerd you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you're into the plant and you know what
would be your message to breeders who are
[SPEAKER_01]: watching to encourage them to come out
because you know we all know that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are these breeders who have not stepped
out of the shadows with their life's work
[SPEAKER_01]: plant yet because you know it's it's it's
super aggressive and people are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: taken advantage of all the time and and
part of the challenge for you both of you
[SPEAKER_01]: with breeders best is going to to really
convince people that this is a safe haven
[SPEAKER_01]: for real plant people so so what would
your message to them be to kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: folks get over the hump to reach out well
I'd say a number of things first I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: committed to this there are lots of things
I could do with my time if I'd been a
[SPEAKER_00]: smart businessman I would have stayed in
neurology practice and retired to the golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course 15 years ago like my colleagues but
that had zero attraction so that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but you know to the breeders or the
plant people I'd say hey you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: consider myself one of you or I'm a
wannabe at least I've been an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer since 1974 I used to run I had the
one of the first Montana certified organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and sold vegetables at the farmers
market so I I know I know their ethos and
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate their values I've met a lot
of these people I realize their quality as
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals and what they're trying to
achieve so I think it's a matter of common
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and certainly if we have the
opportunity to talk one-on-one I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to emphasize why I think that this is
a good avenue for them the other aspect is
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of twenty three years of
working in the cannabis space I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: how I think it should not be done so I
would like to contribute to finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: better way and certainly a big part of
that is finding the breeding targets that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to make better medicine so once
you find these plants and the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: partners and you've run your tests and and
all the ink is dried on the paper is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plan to take these oils and take them down
a pharmaceutical FDA route or is it more
[SPEAKER_01]: to take it and put them out as medical
products but in what we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: now as a recreational market sure well you
know there are multiple possibilities
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the strengths of this
approach so as it is now the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: probably using his or her material
themselves or sharing with friends some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people have found a market in
California but that's been extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to because of the stringent
regulations that are attached to the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: program in California so already with 40
million people this is one of the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis markets in the world but I'd
emphasize that what we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to people in other states other
countries and we would really like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: this to be an international movement but
to specifically answer your question their
[SPEAKER_00]: material might go to a dispensary as flour
or we might want to process into nice
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts that are done ethically clean
extracts using a variety of techniques but
[SPEAKER_00]: additionally I'm also working with
pharmaceutical company that needs better
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles on so this could provide the
breed stock if you will for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: development and obviously that's
potentially extremely lucrative for the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensee so I see endless potential to
this so Dale you know we've all heard
[SPEAKER_01]: horror stories about somebody having a
specialty plant and they give it to their
[SPEAKER_01]: one friend with the promise of them not
sharing it they swear right and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut gets out right and there's a perceived
loss how does it work at this level say
[SPEAKER_01]: for example if you're licensing the plant
material to be grown by a third party or
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are licensing the IP or plant
material to a pharmaceutical company in
[SPEAKER_01]: what manner is that kept safe because
because breeders have good reason to to be
[SPEAKER_01]: watching out for getting ripped off right
and and many of us don't understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: these protections work at a you know seven
eight figure level right so would you
[SPEAKER_01]: would you just explain that for us so so
we all get a better picture on on how
[SPEAKER_01]: that's protected so they're so they're not
going to get ripped off with you getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ripped off by the end by the licensee
right well there I think there are three
[SPEAKER_02]: layers of protection and they're all
really important one of the layers is just
[SPEAKER_02]: a physical physical layer that that anyone
that we work with where we put these
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable genetics they will have to have
the right kind of security now that's
[SPEAKER_02]: never perfect and so that's the the main
reason the reason we're filing patents is
[SPEAKER_02]: not just because I'm a patent attorney
it's because when something slips out you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be able to have recourse
regardless of whether the person knew that
[SPEAKER_02]: what they received was stolen review you
don't you you don't want to have to trace
[SPEAKER_02]: the provenance of some plant if you know
that it's yours and it's patent protected
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can either take the party that's
using the plant without authorization and
[SPEAKER_02]: sign them up as a licensee so that they're
paying money into that breeders royalty
[SPEAKER_02]: rate or total royalty or you get them to
stop doing it and so you've got to have
[SPEAKER_02]: physical security you've patent protection
is really important because it does give
[SPEAKER_02]: you that last line of defense in case
plants do slip out but then the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't talk about as much is having
very strong agreements with everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: involved and this is a lot of the work
that I've done you know I would think in
[SPEAKER_02]: some ways protecting that you're getting
the IP protection is the easy part
[SPEAKER_02]: crafting finding the right partners and
crafting the right kinds of agreements so
[SPEAKER_02]: that no one's burdened by the agreement
but that everyone's protected by the way
[SPEAKER_02]: the agreement is structured super
important so when we do you know as I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned the you know we're the breeders
licensee but then these other parties are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be sub licensees under under our
rights from the breeder and those
[SPEAKER_02]: agreements that we that we have with them
will specify very clearly what they can
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannot do with the plant and as well
as what kind of security they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain and all of this is meant just
just to protect the value that the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: has created with his or her life's work
and we we have to work with with partners
[SPEAKER_02]: probably all over the world and I've done
that with other kinds of plants all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world if you want to get good
medicines or good products out to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people you've got to kind of trust you've
got to find people that are as trustworthy
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible to work with but then you you
fill the gaps in the trust with good
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements and good intellectual property
protection so so let's say that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some people and they're excited right and
they want to reach out and we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are you're at this nexus point right
now where you are fundraising actively but
[SPEAKER_01]: you're also trying to source plants at the
same time so that they kind of come
[SPEAKER_01]: together at the same time that that you
start cashing these checks from investors
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have some plants to work with what
kind of time frames are we looking for do
[SPEAKER_01]: you do you want people to reach out to you
now it's like is it time to like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: call now yeah it is as long as we just we
just hope that they'll be patient with us
[SPEAKER_02]: because we some parts of this come at
almost no cost you know we we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: committed to this we can look at a COA we
can we can we can do some of that analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: without having to spend money but a lot of
it you know once we find a propagation
[SPEAKER_02]: partner or once we start doing some of the
other things to really prepare this to get
[SPEAKER_02]: it out to people that will cost money and
so we we want every breeder who has
[SPEAKER_02]: something special to to trust us to feel
like they can trust us enough to send us
[SPEAKER_02]: in to fill out our form we have a form
that I'll describe in a minute and to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: us about what they've got and let us begin
to evaluate it but I just I hope that they
[SPEAKER_02]: will be patient that many of them have
waited a long time and if they'll wait for
[SPEAKER_02]: us to really be all set up to do this
really well then hopefully we'll be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to reward their patience with some really
great performance on our part but we are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting we have already three special
cultivars signed up to letters of
[SPEAKER_02]: non-binding letters of intent because you
know these people haven't had a chance yet
[SPEAKER_02]: to have an attorney review an agreement we
haven't actually written the agreement so
[SPEAKER_02]: we have letters of intent saying hey we
want to do this you want to do this we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to give this a go we will be turning
those into and we filed provisional patent
[SPEAKER_02]: protection on all of those but we'll be
turning these into definitive agreements
[SPEAKER_02]: and write checks which will be nice part
of this too is that when we do a deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: a breeder they will get some kind of an
advance on their royalties just as a kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of this is how serious we are we're
writing you a check you know they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: retire on that check but it you know it's
better to stick in the eye a check that
[SPEAKER_01]: will cash is not bad right on and in
addition to breeders I mean since you are
[SPEAKER_01]: actively fundraising and and and you know
I know that you've been talking to these
[SPEAKER_01]: folks already and some of those checks are
even in the mail if there are people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are watching because you know there's a
lot of decision makers and investors that
[SPEAKER_01]: that watch shaping fire and follow along
are you interested in incoming contact
[SPEAKER_01]: from people with money to invest as well
sure yeah yeah I mean I welcome the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and I'd like to be able to
explain why I think this is so important
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really again represents a distinct
approach to the problems in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry we have now over 200 licensed
producers in Canada but for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dealing with the same genetics and
the same profiles and it is just not the
[SPEAKER_00]: case that they're all going to survive
what we need is a more focused approach
[SPEAKER_00]: with distinct chemo bars and I think that
breeders best presents the opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: this to happen and again to make better
medicine and I'd like to just add to that
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I'm really excited about
with this is I was having a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: at MJ biz con just yesterday with someone
who said well I have plant breeders I am I
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what's the difference between my
employee plant breeders and these breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and I said well these guys are these men
and women are independent they own their
[SPEAKER_02]: IP those are two big ones right there but
I also said no matter how much technology
[SPEAKER_02]: you have and how great your plant readers
are you've got maybe three or four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: I see our connection with the breeder
community which I hope we will we have and
[SPEAKER_02]: we are committed to living up to we have a
vast army of breeder capacity out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that can look at Ethan's wish list and
make it happen some of the moment they
[SPEAKER_02]: might already have what he wants to bring
to the world in their greenhouse or on
[SPEAKER_02]: their shelf if not instead of just asking
a couple breeders to work on it we're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying hey here's an opportunity if this
interests you take your passion take your
[SPEAKER_02]: independence and do something great with
it and it'll help a lot of people so I
[SPEAKER_02]: love the whole decentralized independent
it's the biggest R&D department in the
[SPEAKER_02]: history of medicine crowdsourcing yeah
you're you're crowdsourcing edits and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: most pure it we really are and we I see it
as an opportunity to help a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of different ways so Dale so
let's say that somebody is a breeder or an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor would you outline how you would
like them to get in contact with you and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also if you're at Emerald Cup this
weekend they're gonna have a booth and
[SPEAKER_01]: when how could they come by and talk with
you either at the booth or how did they
[SPEAKER_02]: get a hold of you via the internet yes we
will have a booth it's a corner booth in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hall of Flowers I wrote it down and
it's way over there I think it's $8.92 but
[SPEAKER_02]: it will have a giant sign $8.72 I'll put
it in the description below okay thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: we also have a website that has just gone
live today on the website there's an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities section opportunities for
plant breeders and if you click on that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a very simple form that requests
some information it's not even you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to fill out all of it fill out all of
it just your name and tell us what's
[SPEAKER_02]: special about the cultivar and if you have
a COA you can upload it and we can start
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a look at it so that's that's one
way for breeders to get in touch is that
[SPEAKER_02]: at breedersbest.com yes at breedersbest
.com and so that's that's a probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four minute form it's it's it's
meant to be easy and to not make you wish
[SPEAKER_02]: you hadn't ever clicked on it so and then
we also have an email address invest at
[SPEAKER_02]: breedersbest.com for anyone who's
interested in talking to us about that and
[SPEAKER_02]: then anyone can write to info at
breedersbest.com with any kind of question
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll we'll be able to hopefully respond
to it in a way that's satisfactory so so
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a breeder you want to go to the
online format breedersbreast.com if you
[SPEAKER_01]: are an investor you want to email to
invest at breedersbest.com and that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: on the website also on the website all
right and then and then if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: another question or you want to get in
contact for some other reason there's info
[SPEAKER_01]: at breedersbest.com all right so all this
will be down in the description as well
[SPEAKER_01]: let's end with you Ethan so you know you
and I both come from the medical side of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and and one thing that I've
learned from working with breeders with
[SPEAKER_01]: the shaping fire show is that yeah
breeders enjoy the botany and the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: but almost all of them started because
they cared about patients would you finish
[SPEAKER_01]: us off by speaking briefly about what you
see as the real human potential in this
[SPEAKER_01]: approach and and and why like you said you
could be doing anything and so why are you
[SPEAKER_01]: putting your heart and time into this
specifically and then end with that well
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the antithesis of the traditional
approach to making medicine which is you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you identify receptor and computer
design a molecule that will fit there with
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest potency and affinity and then
they find out later it's got disastrous
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects with cannabis we're dealing
with a plant that as humans have used for
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years our bodies know how to
deal with this plant but heretofore we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had the best ability to get the
profiles that would be optimized and so
[SPEAKER_00]: while aspects of the industry have gone
for the single molecule and again they're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking in a one-size-fits-all cannabis
isn't like that here we really have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to have individualized
medicine so again depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's profile which would come from
really knowing them their history and
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs we can really suggest a
profile that might be better than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that they could get whether it's
conventional medicine or just garden
[SPEAKER_00]: variety cannabis off the shelf in the
dispensary I see a future in which we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really get things so that we have truly
great medicine that's going to fit a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular person's needs hopefully good
medicine that's therapeutic that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them feel better and not introduce
new problems so if you are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: participating with Breeders Best and
getting to know more I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_01]: check out the website or Dale this weekend
at Emerald Cup thank you both for inviting
[SPEAKER_01]: me I'm really glad to have this
opportunity to chat with you about this
[SPEAKER_01]: new project it's pretty exciting and so
for Dale Hunt Dr. Ethan Russo and myself
[SPEAKER_01]: Shanga Lose of Shaping Fire thank you for
watching you you
