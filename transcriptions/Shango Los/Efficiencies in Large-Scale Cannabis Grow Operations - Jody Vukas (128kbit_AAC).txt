forward slash Shane Olose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody Mugus has been on the forefront of
highly efficient state-of-the-art cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: grow facilities for the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody has designed, built, and retrofitted
well over a million square feet for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the biggest licensed producers in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the emerging cannabis industry
continues to expand across North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: price volatility has become very
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficiency is the key word of the current
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jody will take us through some key points
that can drive down costs and greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: increase margins while ensuring a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please put your phones on vibrate if
they're not already, and please hold your
[SPEAKER_00]: questions until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's offer a warm welcome to Jody.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everyone doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just tell you a little bit about my
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have been building commercial
spaces about a part of eight to nine years
[SPEAKER_01]: now, and retrofitted, design-built
greenhouses, a neighborhood of about 60 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 acres worth to date, working on some
really great projects in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica, as well as Germany and Chile at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a lot of indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Canopy Growth between
Metronome and Metricon up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as Aurora Cannabis and multiple
other states across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: My presentation today is about efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Price volatility is well upon us and has
been chasing after us probably for about
[SPEAKER_01]: the last seven years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: States such as Colorado, which is
currently where I reside, last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I built a facility 40,000 square foot two
years ago for a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, his margins were about 42%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into the fourth quarter and going
into this year, same product, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: same quality, eight plus, he is down to
18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, I just have a new client there,
about 60,000 square feet greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got 400 pounds that he's having to
sell for about $200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So efficiency is going to be everything
when it comes to setting up in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't done it already,
you need to start thinking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to move forward because the
price is going to continue to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dust will settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a correction at some point
in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you sustain it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, design, the key to success.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call them opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of calling them challenges or
issues, there's an opportunity to overcome
[SPEAKER_01]: and be prepared and figure out how to move
forward and into a volatile industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, high capital expenditures is
going to be your biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to take a look at
this and they say, hey, how can we get
[SPEAKER_01]: into this industry, spend a little as much
money as possible, turn around and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: build something, and then we'll take that
capital that we make and we'll reinvest
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're growing $1,000,
$1,100, $1,200 a pound, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: average still to date, you're going to be
out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have emails constantly from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there's about 35 to 40
different businesses for sale because they
[SPEAKER_01]: can no longer make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's already been 10 to 15 that
closed their doors because they just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, capital, high cost capital
expenditure is always going to be costly
[SPEAKER_01]: on the front end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you spend a few extra dollars and
you do it right, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow a $400 pound indoor,
$300 pound indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people told me it couldn't be
done seven, eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it and we're doing it
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing very, very high end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just, you know, B plus, A minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing A plus plus for three to 350 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
what happened in Colorado not that long
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a large, large company called
Sweet Leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet Leaf was trying to increase market
presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They broke the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: This caused a major ripple effect into the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a problem for them was they were
trying to sell their company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by breaking the law, they got shut
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a company as large as they were,
they did $100 million in sales last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: $100 million and they lost well over $1
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: $1 million for that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cost of this was about $1,275 to
grow a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,275.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at this capital
expenditure in your front end design,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have to be very conscious as
a value engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cost versus value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just because something is very
expensive doesn't mean you should buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also in the same token, just because
it's very, very low in cost doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: you should buy it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to look at what you're
spending and what you're going to get for
[SPEAKER_01]: that every dollar that you spend because
it all matters across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's many ways to grow this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's only a few ways to do it
effectively, efficiently, efficiently and
[SPEAKER_01]: cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people like to grow in
soilless mediums such as cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people still use hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to use soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have rocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really have to narrow down and
take a look at your cost, everything from
[SPEAKER_01]: labor, your inputs and figure out what is
going to be the most efficient way for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be highly aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Market volatility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've already touched about that
briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this market isn't going to get
any better any time soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially in this state,
for example, you know, they're estimating
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20,000 licenses to be issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a couple of groups in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two groups that out of, I think there's
maybe 20 temporary license holders now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, more and more groups are going
to be coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still going to be the same
challenge in this state as it is in every
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is a giant when it comes to the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's going to shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's black markets going
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these groups that have been
growing up north and flooding the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market, you know, these guys are going to
be out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one aspect that's kind of
good, you know, for the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least anyhow, because it's going to
allow some sustainability and things to
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilize a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to drive quality,
which I think is something that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been seeing enough in a lot of
states, is quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of volume,
but it's a lot of just average at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with some, you know, Colorado's been
in the marketplace for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is some good quality,
but there's also 70% of the market is what
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everyone just looking to try to
make it a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll be in conscientious of
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality will always sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter what the industry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a car, if it's tires, if it's
clothes, if it's high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: people will pay that extra dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will drive 30 extra minutes to go
and get something that's quality versus
[SPEAKER_01]: going that's right next door and something
that's mediocre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything starts with floor plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing a design in a facility,
floor plan is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything builds on top of your floor
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to be conscientious of
workflows and timelines, how long it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: for an employee to get from one spot to
the next spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these things matter because it's
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor is going to be one of your most
expensive outputs when it comes to growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can minimize travel time,
how your workflow works, if you can keep a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice tight circle, you're going to improve
productivity as well as keep the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bench and lighting plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many ways to set up a grill when
it comes to benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of companies that make
benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always advise people, if you don't hire
a group, such as my company, Smart Girl
[SPEAKER_01]: Pros, or somebody else who want to try to
do it on your own, research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make some phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to the vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're looking at and research
it and get pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you hire a consultant to help you
with this stuff, you should still be
[SPEAKER_01]: educated enough when they start presenting
pricing to you and start talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen it time and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of guys that call themselves
consultants and then I look at the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're doing and it blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people aren't educating themselves
enough and they're spending millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on these projects just to get
pushed through the ringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they get set up and up and
running, they're losing hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of dollars because they didn't
pay attention or they're just taking
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertigation management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important when it comes to cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can minimize your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control your whole crop from start
to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dial in one bench to run one
nutrient program.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a specific OG that's very fickle,
if it's a sativa that requires more
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, if you need to add more
magnesium, or if it requires phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_01]: more phosphate, Fertigation Management
gives you the ability to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control and run as many benches as
you want on one system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bench can have a valve and you can
control everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it very efficient to remove the
human air portion, people mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some groups I've seen a hundred
plus thousand square feet where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hand mixing and they're hand
watering in a hundred thousand square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about a $250,000 a year label by
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set up that building for probably
half the cost of that with a Fertigation
[SPEAKER_01]: Manager and you alleviate all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fertigation Management, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the heart and soul of your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanical systems can be very,
very costly, specifically in states that
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being very smart in the approach,
we like to use different methodologies and
[SPEAKER_01]: different processes instead of just going
straight electrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural gas is one of my favorite
components to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by having an efficient mechanical
system, set up your grow properly with
[SPEAKER_01]: even proper, efficient lighting,
you can pull 40 to 45% less power off the
[SPEAKER_01]: grid than other grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing this for about four or
five years using different options such as
[SPEAKER_01]: natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it goes without question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't set up a large facility and
figure out that you can control your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment by putting a thermostat on the
wall, also running your dehumidification
[SPEAKER_01]: on control on the wall as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have no control over what's
going on in your canopy, you have micro
[SPEAKER_01]: climates at that point, and again,
if you're going to spend that much money,
[SPEAKER_01]: why are you just going to allow a
thermostat on the wall to determine how
[SPEAKER_01]: your room is going to operate?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all an investment, and if you're
spending money lies in the front end,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you spend a little bit more,
the back end, your ROI is going to be so
[SPEAKER_01]: much faster, and you're going to have,
again, complete control over what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to know, you're going to
be able to capture data, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to look at numbers every month,
and you're going to be within very tight
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers of harvest to harvest to harvest
unless you have some major problem along
[SPEAKER_01]: the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a business, and it needs to be run
like a business, and you need to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: it like a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all very important stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting back, floor plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every place has some different
regulatory requirements and restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, California, everything is
based on canopy production of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily require veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: States like Washington, it includes
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: States like Colorado, it's all plant
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, every state is a little bit
different, and even in local
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities, it can be a little bit
different than what the state requires or
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you have to be cognitive and
think about all this stuff and take all
[SPEAKER_01]: the consideration when you're laying out
these floor plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maximizing your grow area, extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, veg, you can learn with two tier
levels in your early veg and part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, which is going to minimize the
required footprint that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, normally for veg, if you're just
running straight benches and using one
[SPEAKER_01]: wide open area, you can cut that space
down by, I would say, about 40%,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can allocate that to your
production, which is grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the flower portion itself is
where your money is being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you can maximize that space and get
yourself 85% canopy coverage in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already mentioned about efficient
workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, equipment locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to put your equipment
in regards to building, servicing,
[SPEAKER_01]: accessibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these things are very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing you want to do is put a bunch
of air handlers inside the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something goes down, something breaks
free, it's dripping on your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: next thing you know, you've got a whole
bench that's diseased or ruined because of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals you're dropping on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have to have guys come in and
service it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the kind of things to keep in
mind because you want to alleviate the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of access that people coming into
the space that doesn't need to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Equipment can be accessed from outside or
a designated space where no one's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: been inserting themselves into the room
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So benches, we'll touch real base about
rolling benches or, you know, benches in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, it costs about $10 a square.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on average for a two-tier bench,
you're looking at roughly $14,
[SPEAKER_01]: $15 a square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the front end, that can seem
a little costly, a little expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have to look at it as an
investment because these things will last
[SPEAKER_01]: for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them in greenhouses,
I've seen them in Canada, I've seen them
[SPEAKER_01]: in Holland where they've been in place for
30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're still functioning and they're
still working fine for one capital
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to cut a little corner here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a few extra books.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you guys using warehouse wrapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all this steel with some paint over
the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within two to three years, because of the
salts that we're using for nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're rusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rust is a contamination problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually there's going to be metal
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing it quite yet,
but you will see metal tests that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed along the way as regulation gets
more intense about what's in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, it's a smart investment and
it just makes sense for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this thing, you're not trying to
set up for two years or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 10 year, 15 year, this is a 20
year, this is a long term investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to do it right,
spend a couple extra dollars and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single level for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've set up so many grows and I've
consulted on quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two-tiered flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two-tiered flower is very, very
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason being is because most
people cannot calculate properly the
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration rates that are required to
control humidity levels, number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: and number two, temperature levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to set up a two-tiered flower,
it's very challenging, but you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that you're doing it right on
the front end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have yet to see one that's performed
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I've ever seen, top level does
extremely well because they're running
[SPEAKER_01]: high level CO2, so they're 82 degrees up
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a six degree difference down on
the bottom level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting quality product up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second level isn't doing so well because
it's high humidity down low and it's nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and warm up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most cases, I don't recommend doing
two-tier, even with LRDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the problem with doing the
two-tiers as well is you're paying them a
[SPEAKER_01]: little extra space, but every time you go
up, you have to have walkways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, part of the fire requirement,
36-inch walkways in between each shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you gain a little extra space,
but you're not necessarily maximizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have two grades of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have A plus on top,
and you're going to have maybe B on the
[SPEAKER_01]: second level.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the benches, it does maximize your
growth space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can effectively get an 85%,
88% canopy coverage in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wall-to-wall planes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canopy management is very important when
it comes to, I think, benches as well or
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increasing biomass is going to increase
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And managing your canopy is going to be
very important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you fill up a room,
you want to plant everything, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to group what you can together so
they all grow very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still going to have some peaks
and rises depending on what the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're properly managing that,
with the benches, you can set up your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole growth so that the canopy is pretty
even across the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that's going to do is going to allow
you to maximize your PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also is going to allow you to get
better light penetration if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: managing your plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The better light penetration you get into
the plant itself, the better production
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys that are growing five, six,
six foot plants, all day long,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will outperform them if you're growing
three foot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are stripping and trimming,
and you see this all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of energy for those plants
to pull that nutrient up to the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: then for it to process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is basically a siphon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It siphons and goes in a circular motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the plant starts to feed and transpire,
it's pulling nutrients and moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: content up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to pull it all the way up the
branches and then get to the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your production is going to do just as
well as a big plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're allowing yourself to actually
manage a plant that's going to be smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are much more easier to manage
when they are a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this one gets lost in the mix
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many girls I go into and I see wall
fans all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: An 18 inch air cane, 18 inch ego plus,
all these wall fans all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only going to get about 8 to 10
foot of throw with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, then what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you're 8 foot,
10 foot, 15 foot into the middle of your
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no earphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend a few extra dollars and get a better
fan and use fewer of them and get higher
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take four fans and drive air in a
5,000 square foot room versus running 20
[SPEAKER_01]: of these wall fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting designs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting companies are there to get the
support that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a lighting plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say, oh, a 5.5 footprint is going to
make it happen for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No reflectors these days are squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is rectangular, so you're never
going to get talk of light coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're growing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average person has no idea what PPFD
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A higher number requires a more advanced
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run 1,100 myself, but then
again, I'm only running nine and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of 10 hours of light because I'm
giving enough photon energy down in a
[SPEAKER_01]: short period of time and I'm hitting with
a lot of nutrient and high CO2 levels that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants get what they need in a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I save electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very costly as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can use natural gas and supplement,
I like to use natural gas water chillers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows me to pull off the grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversion, for an example, say in
Colorado, it's about 11 cents a kilowatt
[SPEAKER_01]: hour for electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: With natural gas on the gas conversion
rate, that brings down to about two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start looking at these things and
saying, wow, holy shit, I just saved
[SPEAKER_01]: myself a bunch of money every month
because now I'm using natural gas to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing that electricity is going
to cost me X amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can save yourself $15,000 to
$20,000 a month if you're setting your
[SPEAKER_01]: system up and your mechanical systems
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do reheat capture, which you can
utilize that heat as part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: defunification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, myself, have designed and have
the utility panel on a CO2 capture where
[SPEAKER_01]: we can capture the exhaust off these
units.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have pure CO2 as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you only pay for the initial upfront
cost of building the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your CO2 is free for the rest of
your operation and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of ways to be efficient with
your mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't cut corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you cut corners, it's going to
cost you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next thing you know, you're going to
be getting $50,000 or $60,000 electric
[SPEAKER_01]: bill every single month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity's not getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never going to get cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I touched briefly on, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't think it's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reason being, there's minerals and stuff
that are left in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use a needed filter to get your
chemicals out, you've got to plant another
[SPEAKER_01]: sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use auto water from day in,
day out, you know exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think water is one of the lost
components that people fail to realize is
[SPEAKER_01]: that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most nutrient programs are designed on RO
water or very low TDS water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use that as part of your
application, you're going to get an ROI on
[SPEAKER_01]: that faster than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because next thing you know, your plant
uptake is going to be much greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because given the nutrients it needs and
the mineral it needs, through nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: not through what's sourced in your city
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, recapture, you're going to see
about 40% return.
[SPEAKER_01]: On condensation and leaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're pumping out 10,000 gallons per
day in nutrient delivery, you can capture
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 of that and clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And run it through a second RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have another 75%, 80% of that of
pure water to reuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very, very efficient and very
cost-saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drip irrigation, I mean, I kind of think
it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, you can, if you're using
rockwool, which is not a fluid method,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, use one liter per day for a
plant that's three to four feet in height
[SPEAKER_01]: in about four to six ounce plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One liter per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus running cocoa or running soil,
where you're going to use a gallon and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half per day on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then on top of that,
you have to get rid of that medium as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs you $2.50 to $3 per plant just in
the medium, where rockwool, it's $1.80.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it saves you all some time
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's labor involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's disposal involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, being strategic in
methodologies makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to spend the money,
you're going to do certification,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might as well just do it right and do
it commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, using rockwool in my experience,
I've always had the argument of you're
[SPEAKER_01]: never going to get the taste out of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turkey profiles are going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're giving the plant exactly
what it needs, when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to know what you're doing in
order to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing in rockwool for a better
part of 13 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never had somebody tell me,
hey, there's no flavor in your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your super lemon haze doesn't taste like
lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to know what you're giving
the plant and what the plant needs and
[SPEAKER_01]: when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certification is great because you can
feed five times, six times an hour versus
[SPEAKER_01]: once a day or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you can feed, the more the
plant's going to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's its whole mission in life,
is to feed and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all these plants want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, fertigation, I think, is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drip irrigation is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing, environmental controls,
automation, you know, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important, again, because you
can control and dial in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grab data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cross-reference data from each
harvest, run your test results and run it
[SPEAKER_01]: back to back and cross-reference
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can dial in specific strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to push your CP levels and
your cyber tsunami, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant's a 19 or a 20 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can run all these tests,
get all your results back, and then take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at all the data you're running,
your environmental controls, and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding it, what your EC levels
were, what your pH levels were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can cross-reference all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows you to be much smarter with
your grow than what most people are in
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, that's what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to put you ahead of the
pack, which most people are racing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom in these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I've got time for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did leave about three minutes for one
good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned you were accomplishing a
nine to 10-hour operating grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing that with traditional HBS?
[SPEAKER_01]: In flowering, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all HBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also with plasma supplemental.
Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So running plasma supplemental,
on average, it's 1,270 supplemental for
[SPEAKER_01]: every 1,200 watts on average of HBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's running about 1,100 at
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, average is 850 to 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a matter of really just,
I've been running a VHBS for a better part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I noticed is after an
hour and 11, I started seeing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started rolling back the time a
little bit, rolling back the time a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to a point just before I started
to see a little bit of that dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started shutting down the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Productivity increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resin production increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants just seemed happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: No reduction in the yield, or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I noticed a bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed an increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a little more time in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dark hours as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant just seemed happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked that question too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I heard that, I was like,
oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clients are all going to want to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jody's going to be here for a few more
minutes in case you had any questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you didn't feel like raising your
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hear it again for Jody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
