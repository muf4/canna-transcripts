[SPEAKER_06]: Off we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first time at the summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a fantastic day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Elizabeth Bennett.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a professor at Lewis and Clark College
in Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an international political economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work with the intersection of
politics and economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think about most is globalized
supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I care about most is workers'
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exploitation all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until a few years ago, most of my time
was spent on organic textiles and coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And following those around the world,
seeing how people were treated when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were working in those industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also paying a lot of attention to what
consumers were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look to see, you know,
who made my shirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was my coffee grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I want to support with my dollar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I study consumer activism and global
supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last six years, I've been living
in Colorado and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking a lot about cannabis,
as this story unfolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the last two, two and a half
years, I've been doing a lot of research
[SPEAKER_01]: on these issues as they apply to cannabis
in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm interested in is who is
growing, who is trimming, and what is
[SPEAKER_01]: their life like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one of dignity and possibility,
of agency and opportunity, or is it one of
[SPEAKER_01]: hardship and limitations?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk about some changes I see
happening in the cannabis labor force.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it used to look like, where I think
it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the problems I think are
associated with the current and very near
[SPEAKER_01]: future of farm labor and trim labor in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some special challenges that this industry
faces compared to others in addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some suggestions for ways forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis market for the last,
say, 30 years, in terms of who is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and trimming, 75% of cannabis in the US,
as you probably know, is coming from the
[SPEAKER_01]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people growing, working for
other people on farms and trimming have
[SPEAKER_01]: been white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been US born, and they've been
migrant labor working in town and
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture products in the off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means these are people with a
relatively great amount of privilege
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to workers who are in other
agricultural industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that there haven't been
immigrants and migrant laborers working in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for the last three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have definitely been pockets of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not been what's dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really different than the rest of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the last 30 years, people who have
been working in cannabis, the demographic
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just described, have been accepting
a great deal of risk in exchange for a
[SPEAKER_01]: great deal of reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pay has been very high compared to
working in other agricultural sectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risk has also been extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that for cannabis, grow workers
and trimmers, wage theft is pervasive,
[SPEAKER_01]: being promised a wage and not paid that
correct amount, or being asked to wait
[SPEAKER_01]: additional weeks or months and being paid
a different amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sexual assault and harassment is common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unsafe living and working conditions also
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 2012 and 2015, 2016, the Humboldt
Domestic Violence Service Center said that
[SPEAKER_01]: they receive about 2000 calls per year
from Humboldt County alone, and about two
[SPEAKER_01]: people a year go missing who have been
working in cannabis in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those statistics are much higher than in
other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I've been working with trimmers and
with workers, I have yet to encounter one
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmer who's been working for over five
years in the industry who has not had a
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experience of some sort of labor
exploitation or has not personally known
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who has had that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have good statistics on the
demographics of the labor force and the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of exploitation, but we know it's
at least on par with other agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we've been looking at for
maybe the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the changes in labor force going in
different directions for the illegal and
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: For growing and trimming on the illegal
market, prices are falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The days of getting a huge amount of value
for product are largely over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think someone said this leads to
innovation and communication, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also leads to different types of labor
exploitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm starting to see happening in
the illegal market is attracting people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are willing to work for less money.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are often migrant workers,
new immigrants, people with legal statuses
[SPEAKER_01]: that are less straightforward,
extremely vulnerable populations are
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to work in illegal cannabis at
greater numbers than have ever before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is starting to look a lot like big
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big agriculture in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is a place where the most vulnerable
people in our population work,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are extremely susceptible to
exploitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to give a sense of what that would look
like for cannabis to move to the big ag
[SPEAKER_01]: model, each year in the United States,
300,000 agricultural workers report
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20,000 agricultural workers report acute
pesticide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are reported accounts, not estimates
based on reported data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's at the very, very low end of
what's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of people with too much
pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps us understand why life
expectancy is shorter in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: for agricultural workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps us understand why birth weight is
lower for children born to agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: workers and why those children are more
likely to have chronic health conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not in agriculture,
children of the same age wouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that in the United States in big
agriculture, women who are working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, 80% report sexual harassment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one in three women, they say that they
have been or know someone who has been
[SPEAKER_01]: sexually assaulted while working in the
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm saying that cannabis and labor
might be moving toward what big ag looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like, then I'm starting to sing the chorus
that I've heard here throughout today,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is to say, we don't want to go that
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly, I think it's likely that things
will be worse for people working in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis than in big agriculture because
it's underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lack of reporting,
a lot of victims landing, lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the legal sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I hear a lot when I do this
research and when I go to conferences is
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a group full of people who largely
work in the legal sector, or what we care
[SPEAKER_01]: about is regulating the legal sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I beg to differ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the legal sector moving in the
direction of the big meat industry in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know anything about the big meat
industry, it's always relied on
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work is extremely challenging and
extremely dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Human Rights Watch reports that all
manufacturing in the United States to work
[SPEAKER_01]: in slaughtering and processed meat is by
far the most dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This explains why in 2006 the people who
worked in these slaughtering facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: were the most vulnerable of our
population, the people in our communities
[SPEAKER_01]: that are easiest to exploit, people who
had migration statuses where they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to work, who were undocumented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2006 there was a rate across the
United States on meat facilities and the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry decided we can no longer hire
people who might not be legal to work in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should hire resettled refugees because
they are the next easiest to exploit in
[SPEAKER_01]: our community and we know that they're
legal to work and we're not susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: race anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what big meat looks like in the United
States today is 35% immigrants,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% coming from East Africa, pervasive
wage theft, pervasive sexual harassment,
[SPEAKER_01]: Human Rights Watch reports,
[SPEAKER_01]: a high number of injuries on the job and a
hostile working environment, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: for workers of color, especially for
Muslim workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a famous case in Colorado,
hundreds of Muslim workers were fired when
[SPEAKER_01]: they were organizing to have rare times
that suited their cultural needs and were
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for this facility to help arrange
some of the production practices around
[SPEAKER_01]: their use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fired, there's been union
busting, there have been missing after
[SPEAKER_01]: organizing meat factory workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really vulnerable population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm describing kind of the old market,
what it looked like in two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the new market going in terms of
labor and labor abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the lines between what
cannabis labor used to look like and will
[SPEAKER_01]: look like in the future isn't so clear and
the difference between illegal and legal
[SPEAKER_01]: sectors is not so clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to illustrate, I hear stories every
time I talk to tremors about what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked to a woman in Oregon a couple
months ago who described last year looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for work on illegal farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believing that the farm was growing,
was licensed and was going to sell at the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to be paid in the legal market,
that was her intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was locked in a basement without her
cell phone and not allowed to emerge until
[SPEAKER_01]: her trimming was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are typical stories that I hear all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is someone aiming toward the illegal
sector in Oregon this past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of our conceptions about what
happens now that cannabis is legal don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really map onto the reality of workers'
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't want to go the route of big
meat and if we don't want to go the route
[SPEAKER_01]: of big agriculture and we don't want to go
the route of underground exploitation,
[SPEAKER_01]: then something needs to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some special challenges I see in
cannabis compared to making sweaters or
[SPEAKER_01]: shoes or growing coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is reticent to highlight its
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long fight and I know I've
followed the careers of many people in
[SPEAKER_01]: this room and you've fought long and hard
to have cannabis recognized as something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is dignified and deserves a seat at
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to throw it under the bus by showing
ways in which it exploits people can be
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a lot of shoving labor
problems under the bus as to not reveal a
[SPEAKER_01]: blemish in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-profit organizations won't touch
cannabis as a ten-foot pole when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to labor rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to every fair trade, domestic fair
trade, workers' rights organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they set up a couple of unions,
no one wants to work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it's the industry that has to
do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers are not your market cannabis as
places for ethical shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go into dispensaries and ask
for organic and fair trade everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single time, even if they would in
other markets or when shopping for other
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people misunderstand the labor
practices and need to be educated about
[SPEAKER_01]: what fair labor looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people think that if something's grown
in Washington or Oregon, it must be fair
[SPEAKER_01]: labor or fair trade because it's the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: of A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ways forward to close.
[SPEAKER_01]: The obvious things about policy and
enforcement, employer education,
[SPEAKER_01]: workers' rights education, collective
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supporting growers who are already doing
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are people in the room that
spend a lot of time with these growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are paying health insurance or
providing incredible work environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find them and urge them to share their
practices and support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Kevin said, vote with your wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, vote with your wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support voluntary initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been lots of organic-like
labels that have come up for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be familiar with Clean Green or
Kind Certified since the USDA won't do
[SPEAKER_01]: organic label for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of substitutes that have
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those include labor provisions,
some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that do include labor
provisions can do a better job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see something labeled as
ethical, ask what that means for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are actually working in that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing is consumer education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am happy to share over networking some
statistics from two years ago in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a number of college students go to a
random sample of half the dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland, which was not hard to find
college students.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were asking for socially
responsible and environmentally friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and we documented what people
were willing to sell us and the claims
[SPEAKER_01]: they were making about those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave 75% of dispensaries a B,
C, not an A for quality of information.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was asked to come here today to speak
about economics on the black community.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not an inclusionary system at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at the barriers to entry for
one of the hardest reasons in the state of
[SPEAKER_09]: Washington, to get a license, it's a major
factor for what happened to felony,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is the result of the war on drugs,
probably by about 80% of all males in the
[SPEAKER_09]: black community to get a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Second would be wealth, capital,
to be able to hold onto the license and be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you understand economics in the US and
you understand that there are racial
[SPEAKER_09]: disparities, this is not a pretty thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a fact.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the house of bubble preyed upon
the black and Spanish communities,
[SPEAKER_09]: Mexican communities.
[SPEAKER_09]: They, through all types of different
policies from the GI Bill, to the
[SPEAKER_09]: Homestead Act, to housing discrimination,
all play into legal cannabis that we're
[SPEAKER_09]: sitting here talking about today,
and why there isn't a positive effect on
[SPEAKER_09]: the black community.
[SPEAKER_09]: The war on drugs, or at least that was
housing discrimination.
[SPEAKER_09]: Housing discrimination is the biggest
determination of wealth and capital,
[SPEAKER_09]: and capital gains in America.
[SPEAKER_09]: Without homeownership, you have no access
to wealth.
[SPEAKER_09]: You will stay in a perpetual state of
poverty.
[SPEAKER_09]: That, then, too, is also tied to the
education system.
[SPEAKER_09]: The education system is funded by the
values of your homes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you value your home in a red line
neighborhood, you're never able to gain
[SPEAKER_09]: equity or gain value in your home.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was never a chance for your schools
to gain full funding and become an
[SPEAKER_09]: educated community.
[SPEAKER_09]: From those, if you have an uneducated
community, if you have a wealthy,
[SPEAKER_09]: private neighborhood, you come up with
crime.
[SPEAKER_09]: The war on drugs is thrown on the black
community, on top of housing
[SPEAKER_09]: discrimination, on top of all these other
redlining and everything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: That war, we all know now, was targeted at
hippies and black men.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a free debate.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is fact.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a large population of people in
prison in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Half that population being black men.
[SPEAKER_09]: That right there excludes millions of guys
from being involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: A black two-parent home making $100
million still has less of a chance of
[SPEAKER_09]: buying a home today in 2017 than a
one-parent home under a white neighborhood
[SPEAKER_09]: with a diploma.
[SPEAKER_09]: The wealth gap between whites and blacks
is like 12 to 1.
[SPEAKER_09]: The numbers are just mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All that leads into impoverished
neighborhoods, impoverished neighborhoods
[SPEAKER_09]: leads into war on drugs, which leads to
the targeting of black men, which now we
[SPEAKER_09]: have legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, legal cannabis is really just a
slap in the face of black America.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a failed social experiment.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been exclusionary from day one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't addressed any of the issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just saw another man up here speak
about what it was like to go through war
[SPEAKER_09]: and PTSD, but the war on drugs was on
black men, but we can't get recognized.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody will ever say anybody in my
community has PTSD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hence, the non-inclusionary, the
non-wanting to be involved in a system
[SPEAKER_09]: that for so long victimized and
criminalized the exact same thing that
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody in this room is attempting to
do, and build personal economic wealth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not looking at the economics of the entire
community of countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about personal wealth gaining in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not about growing economic wealth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every idea that has come forward has been
based on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an individual idea, not on the
greater good of the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at what the trauma that black
Americans have suffered because of the war
[SPEAKER_09]: on drugs, it would also, if you look
around the room, explain to you why I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: one of very few black men sitting in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can count on our numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: This room isn't even a demographic
representative of the state of Washington,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is 8% black males, or 8% black
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have less than 1% black people in this
room.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we going to do in conclusion?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to address through this
issue?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not being addressed, not by anybody,
not by anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just actually, if you look at today,
to the open equity program, which might be
[SPEAKER_09]: the most progressive equity program in the
country, that you can't get a license
[SPEAKER_09]: unless you have somebody that was
disenfranchised before, who were on drugs,
[SPEAKER_09]: get a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's ways to attempt it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been involved with cannabis in the
state since 2009.
[SPEAKER_09]: The medical kicked off, and it's the same
conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Washington is looking at black people to
end the racist discrimination problems,
[SPEAKER_09]: but racism is not a black problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem of inclusion in the system is
it's going to take everybody in this room
[SPEAKER_09]: to rethink what and how we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Inclusion cannot be, you can be the
security guard at the front door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Inclusion has to be executives.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be in administrative roles
versus service roles.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be that the same person sitting
in prison for bagging up weed and selling
[SPEAKER_09]: weed now has hireable skills towards a
legal business but can't get in because he
[SPEAKER_09]: has a felony, which is mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: My goal and my conclusion, in conclusion,
is just really think twice and real hard
[SPEAKER_09]: about what it is that you're doing in the
legal cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you actively doing something,
or are you using guys like me for tokenism
[SPEAKER_09]: versus participation?
[SPEAKER_09]: Slaves participated in the building of the
great love of this America that we never
[SPEAKER_09]: reported.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't ever come into the cannabis with
the expectation that it would be
[SPEAKER_09]: different, but I did expect some kind of
inclusion somewhere along the line for
[SPEAKER_09]: what the war on drugs did to an entire
community and then the moving forward of
[SPEAKER_09]: it and the non-addressing of that issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might not be an issue and a reality to
a lot of people's world, but the other
[SPEAKER_09]: part is a part of America where the drug
war is still happening to this day.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about, and I've heard
conversations in here today about the
[SPEAKER_09]: opioid and this and that, but they're
still in South Seattle pressing young
[SPEAKER_09]: white kids for crack.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we determine now that opioids are
less more addictive or less harmful to
[SPEAKER_09]: society than crack?
[SPEAKER_09]: The disparities in the drug war are still
happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't talk about them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just ignore them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignorance is bliss.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignorance is safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the safest place to hide,
is each other's ignorance.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really think twice and hard about what
you're doing moving forward and your
[SPEAKER_09]: inclusion of minorities involved in this
community, in this cannabis community
[SPEAKER_09]: because this thing isn't going to grow
unless you start including everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not going to grow without
diversity here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need diversity in this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray, could you reset that timer,
please?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck on 502.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was counting on that to suddenly pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Aaron, and thank you,
Dr. Pettit, for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, first, I'll introduce
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of automatically assume everyone,
a lot of people here are already familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Dr. Dominic Corba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder and executive director of
the Center for the Study of Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with the Alliance and the
predecessor to the Alliance these last
[SPEAKER_00]: four years to develop the popular
education aspect of cannabis legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: in ways that go beyond industry formation
and figuring out the problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys kind of have a handle on that in
many ways, but there's also the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: social issues, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to this and I started this
organization slightly optimistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, thinking that because the soul of
the cannabis industry comes from oppressed
[SPEAKER_00]: people, to be honest, people in pain,
oppressed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say hippies, what we're really
talking about is anti-war activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Socialists, 1960s, Amanda gave you a nice
prelude to this general concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that those values could at
least be carried into the system that had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of problems, an economic system that
already has a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard Dr. Bennett talk about cannabis
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to become like regular
agriculture, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we want any aspect of the
cannabis industry to become like the way
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is in the United States,
which in particular, it sets up barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: to not prosperity, but survival for an
increasingly large amount of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing inequality in this country in
the last 30 years is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: astonishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen public policy shift from at
least pretending to care about the public
[SPEAKER_00]: and more towards let's enable the public
and the private sector to take care of our
[SPEAKER_00]: social policy, and then you turn to the
free market and let that sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's happened is the concentration
of wealth and power on the hands of the
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely ineffective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we do cannabis legalization in a
very, very, very significant degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: My broader purpose was to talk about
racial political economy, but in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't try to represent black people
and black people's interests, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, you've got Aaron,
thankfully, especially here speaking from
[SPEAKER_00]: that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do is talk about kind of
the big picture, and this past year has
[SPEAKER_00]: been very interesting for me as I've been
asked to go speak, I think, in context
[SPEAKER_00]: where the things that I struggle with here
in Washington State get put into a
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This past June, I was invited to go speak
and theorize in the Drug Work Office at
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of Essex in the UK,
and it was fascinating because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives there and the folks who are
dealing with really significant issues
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the treatment of migrants,
mules, violence against women,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I go in there and I'm like,
oh yeah, I'm here from a place where we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got progressive drug policy and I'm going
to complain about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really forced me to think a lot harder
about what are those connections between
[SPEAKER_00]: what I see as the winnable balance here
that I want to be fighting and the broader
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, which is global social change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way things are are not good in
every sense of three words, international
[SPEAKER_00]: political economy, of which the US is a
major driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to remind is the purpose of
legalization is to end the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the primary point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that that's how I-502
certainly was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the primary way it was sold was as
a racial justice initiative with some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there could be some markets that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the initiatives that we've had so
far are really, they're selling race,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what ends up happening is it just gets
forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by now there's plenty of evidence
that this is a bait and switch in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to the public who's otherwise
concerned about racial justice,
[SPEAKER_00]: economic justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we turn around and do our darvis to
just completely forget about it and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it about state revenue or make it about
who gets to be represented to the decision
[SPEAKER_00]: makers, which are people with a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other conference I'm going to be
bringing into the dialogue that I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: was the DPA conference in Atlanta,
which was like a breath of fresh air for
[SPEAKER_00]: me because I could go there and I could
start at a higher level in the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I could go there and say this and
explain this was not controversial at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about the DPA this year
is that they've even made a little step
[SPEAKER_00]: down and there's new leadership in the
DPA, which prior to now is focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing campus legalization initiatives
because in and of themselves they would
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the DPA has dramatically
shifted mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the great things that I saw
at the reform conference, which is to put
[SPEAKER_00]: race front and center in this country when
it comes to what the DPA is working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some extent, very few policy
initiatives that do directly engage with
[SPEAKER_00]: race in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They intersect a little bit with some DPA
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cap Packer down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about LA yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking an extra couple of weeks to
get it figured out, but it's precisely
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're dealing with actual social
equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just going to open it up and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make sure they've got their
process down and that Cap Packer is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing you can look forward to
going forward is in fact that DPA
[SPEAKER_00]: functions as a funding mechanism for
social change.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be seeing, I think,
a lot more effort towards academic
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement and policy fixes than you've
seen before in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put a vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the actually existing policy
effort addressing a racial political
[SPEAKER_00]: economy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Municipal rents, Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco wants to copy Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA is doing it, but past that,
there's not much here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting in Nova Scotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asked, what are the racial justice
things that you guys are doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Aaron pointed out, the points in
Oakland towards getting a license are
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll sponsor someone from the impacted
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking the private sector to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than nothing for sure,
but it's basically like there's a public
[SPEAKER_00]: interest and we're going to leave it to
the private sector to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's areas where that's
appropriate, areas where actually this is
[SPEAKER_00]: so big that actually we need to hit this
head on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various access is really the final issue,
is that we've made it so tough to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this industry, no small part,
to meet regulatory issues and until
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday, apparently, to comply with the
coal memo, which turns out was much to do
[SPEAKER_00]: about nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coal memo has been used as actually a
way to reproduce racial injustice because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been used to keep barriers high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used to prevent home-growth from
being a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give a shout out to Graham
Simmons, because what he says is
[SPEAKER_00]: home-growth is a small step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have home-growth, you're not going
to get real research until it's okay
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to even have home-growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say it applies to the industry here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want counties to stop banning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to be allowed to sell
and advertise and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be okay with the general
public to the degree that that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you guys are going to be a
lot more free to operate and do well and
[SPEAKER_00]: address your particular markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the stigma only helps you and the
folks who are opposing home-growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: economic reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I think you need to rethink that
really, really carefully because you are
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing prohibition as a cultural
institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to talk about is
the word licenses to people, but we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstruct communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the structural effects of
prohibition, they're not just throwing one
[SPEAKER_00]: person in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The knock-on effects are the invisible
punishments that happen after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the families, it breaks up the
families, the incomes are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The communities themselves are just
absolute gutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Richard Nixon's Wet Dreams is
pretty much a really perfect way to
[SPEAKER_00]: probably stimulate his anti-governmental
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The politics of racial and political
economy, who can be represented?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose public safety matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we talk about protecting the
public, I want you to know that generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, when politicians talk about it,
they're talking about the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals or stakeholders who are paying
lobbyists to tell them to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governance should not be a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Policy should not be something that is
bought and sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be public representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to work on representation and
transparency when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just going to help black
communities and people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help the folks, the broader
spectrum population that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is bigger than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is democracy and how to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that the racial
argument is lifted up and amplified as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the broader social problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just affecting black people,
the pressure of black people affects you
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a better society.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, questions that are total
heresy to bring up in public can get
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed in arenas where this
understanding is there, like in Atlanta,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have actually, what about
Gookey?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the street corner drug dealer?
[SPEAKER_00]: He loses his income.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people participate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about patients, what about HIV
patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about people who actually were able
to come together before, farmers markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth, and get therapeutic benefit
out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also being together and not being
stigmatized, which is the story of the HIV
[SPEAKER_00]: AIDS crisis in the social clubs in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about making more
opportunities in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can come, but removing politics of
suspicion and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each small step we can take is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in this state, like right now,
homegrown is one of those small steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually removing the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove that to make people okay
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove the power of people with
money to determine policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my message really, is that I need
to let social policy govern markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: not everywhere around, and that's going to
lead to healthier markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are squeezed to death by
complying with regulations that are there
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect the public, but that protection
is political theater for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is we can't go around and
continue to stigmatize folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in the cannabis market,
in the informal market either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you advocate more punishment to
prop up something, you're on the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: side and you don't look at what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my message today and I hope you
enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Toby Patterson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a research economist at the Office of
Financial Management in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of three economists that support
the governor's policy staff and other bits
[SPEAKER_02]: and pieces like the legislators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for the USDA National Agricultural
Statistics Services before I came.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to Washington, I grew up here,
so I was in the other Washington,
[SPEAKER_02]: sweating and dying as a statistician,
counting chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your history.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job as a research economist with a
family is pretty fun, but it leads me in
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank Laura for inviting
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to note the people here are
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went to the LCB to provide economic
guidance on how to institute a working
[SPEAKER_02]: market, I indicated that the market should
define itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said the number of consumers was
unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quantity demanded was some unknown
number as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further, the number of producers and the
volume produced was unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommended the notion that the number
of producers and retailers would
[SPEAKER_02]: equilibrate as the market matures and thus
the number of licenses should not have a
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make that note.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several of the LCB constituents at the
table vehemently disagreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, hey, I'm a capitalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So LCB hired an anti-cannabis drug policy
person to guide their economic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I was saying, look,
a working market for cannabis and a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable expectation of the public is a
market where consumers can buy a
[SPEAKER_02]: high-quality cannabis product that is
uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is pesticide-free and price is
fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in essence, an orderly, stable market
that is safe, free of antitrust,
[SPEAKER_02]: and protects consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not recovered from the 1936
propaganda film reframedics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potential market place of farmers and
buyers is instead a convoluted password of
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurs eager to create a capitalist
market and crotchety men regulating based
[SPEAKER_02]: on archaic mythology and overreaching
illiteracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a bit of a cynic.
I'm not totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an economist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that always
intrigues me about market failure is
[SPEAKER_02]: asymmetric information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember the cigarette industry
used to say that cigarettes are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, OK, I'm going to look at
this from purely like, what do we have
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is provided to the public to know
about this industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just poked around and said,
OK, well, the LCB is tasked with providing
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of education material on
marijuana, cannabis, refer, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I looked and I said, OK,
well, I picked one subject fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, on the website, it said,
can getting high cause marijuana problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, OK, well, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pressed on the link and it said,
science-based information for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, OK, well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's presented by the University of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to both UW and WSU, so no
affiliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, scientists think that
cannabis causes problems remembering
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with grades and negatively
affects learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed, huh, there's no citations
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says science-based right at the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get a welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, hey, you claim science-based,
so where are the citations?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so they replied back,
well, it was this one professor that used
[SPEAKER_02]: to be here and he just, because he wanted
a nice write-up that was easy for the
[SPEAKER_02]: public to read and digest, he just sounded
crazy right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, OK, well, that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, the person pointed me to the
National Academy of Science, current
[SPEAKER_02]: release, maybe somebody who's seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a 178 page order.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had already read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, well, that contradicts
everything that your website says.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this education?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they never reply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the purpose of the asymmetric
information in this game?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's winning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are the allegiances still there to
this prohibition mindset?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I wonder about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I look at all sorts of markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the LCB adopted the same prohibition
strategy as they used for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same number of retail stores,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they got the 233 stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Costco stole them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, we need something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making fire after saying all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's enforcement of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the long history of prohibition has
wide cultural implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have heard marijuana is a very
dangerous drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet this hypothesis is profoundly
unproven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reality is not an impressive support
of the assertion that cannabis is at all
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though the only thing I will say that
cannabis is dangerous is enforcement,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have you ever seen die
from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how many people have been arrested?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so what happens next?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will note that in Washington,
the latest estimates are there are about
[SPEAKER_02]: 11,000 direct employment jobs in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though the wage rate is somewhere in the
mid $13 an hour range, so it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: seemingly, I was kind of shocked it was
that low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is the black market still there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of, I leave you with that
sort of ambiguous question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond that, what's really the
economic cost of prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I, that's sort of in
my mind's eyes, like why, why are we in
[SPEAKER_02]: this sort of lockstep of, it's not,
it's not a free market at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this small microcosm of a few
licenses which are given a maximum number.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I cannot figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you for the wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura, thank you for the invitation to be
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm honored to sit on a panelist of
people who have such depth of knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: about the state of the industry and its
possible future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna shift gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Barbara Tolbert and I'm the
mayor from the city of Arlington.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a small community in North Spanish
County of about 18,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're what I like to call is on the urban
edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to be ruled, we need to be
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are in quiet ways and we butt right
up against the big cities and the
[SPEAKER_03]: urban-ness that happens in Snohomish
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to talk to you about today
with your indulgence is I just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you the story of Arlington and
Cannabis and how it came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope through the story that you can
gain some insight into how elected
[SPEAKER_03]: officials might be viewing the I-5-02
initiative, what it means to their
[SPEAKER_03]: community, and hopefully what you mean to
their business initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'm always excited to be in a
room full of entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bold step and I honor anybody who
wants to step into business.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2012, in November, state of Washington
voted positively for I-5-02, initiative
[SPEAKER_03]: 502, to allow cannabis operations in the
state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a mayor for nine months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never sat in an elected office
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had huge problems in our city coming up
with the recession.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were not recovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were really in the depths of it still,
even though nationally the economy was
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to recover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was like, oh, okay, one more
thing to add to the plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept all of the literature that I had
received from August through November
[SPEAKER_03]: because there was a lot of any elected,
any kind of initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of propaganda, pro and con.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I knew this was the message that our
community was getting and this is what we
[SPEAKER_03]: would have to talk about, how the vote
went.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing we did is we sat down
and we looked at the numbers for our
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arlington, a conservative community in
northern Snomish County had voted
[SPEAKER_03]: positively in the direction of I-5-02.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our citizens wanted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we better figure out what we're gonna
do about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called a meeting of our senior managers
that week together because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: gauge where we were at as a city with
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being a relatively new mayor and many of
them had been in their positions for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to hear honestly where they
were at with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very interesting and some of it
almost felt like it really mirrored the
[SPEAKER_03]: literature that had been going around the
community for two months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those in the public safety who had been
being funded by the War on Drugs for
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple decades were very nervous about
the public safety concerns of the
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they couldn't really articulate
those public safety concerns and drilling
[SPEAKER_03]: down on questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the kids, the school, oh my God,
crime, all of those things that were gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to our community if we allow this
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our community economic development
department, those of you who were here
[SPEAKER_03]: last year had the privilege of hearing
Chris Young speak, building inspectors'
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective on the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found curiosity going on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, what does it mean to your business
initiatives?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the employment look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to be the ratio of employees
per square footage?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does this fit into our culture and our
desire to be a manufacturing community?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was some curiosity that was
happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was just a lot of
ambivalence like, oh really, do you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know, it doesn't
matter what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our citizens have spoken to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our job, to figure out how to make
work what they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went to work and we used our
planning commission.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you are located in
municipalities or counties, got businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You all have within those who are planning
under the Growth Management Act,
[SPEAKER_03]: aside from the elected officials,
there's usually a panel of volunteers
[SPEAKER_03]: called the planning commission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the planning commission sets about
helping jurisdictions figure out a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulations under land use that are
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they deal with a lot of positive
judicial things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones who are doing the
comprehensive plans to figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning goes where and who can go where.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we knew that this would affect them
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chairman of our planning commission said,
hey, I'll take this on as research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Older gentleman, we thought, you know,
he's pretty fair and open, so let him go
[SPEAKER_03]: do some research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he began contacting people around the
state of Washington who understood what
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that look like and what does it
mean to a jurisdiction?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought us back a report that was
devoid of any judgment, but really a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of factual information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it was there's a lot of
unknowns.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the beginning of legalization of
an industry who we couldn't classify as an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry before because it was done on the
black market and it wasn't legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to figure out what all of this
would mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw the directors starting to get
a little intellectually curious of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want you to, if you're
intellectually curious, come talk to us
[SPEAKER_03]: about the job, because that's what we
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll train you what you need to know to
do the qualifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want people who are intellectually
curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we began to get a little intellectual
curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we make this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it fit into our initiatives?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't, there was a lot that went on
in that period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also knew we had to educate the
elected officials, myself and the city
[SPEAKER_03]: council members, who would be responsible
for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you who don't know,
in the last 10 years, cities of all sizes
[SPEAKER_03]: have been driven by data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the recession and what happened
afterwards, we're using data, big data,
[SPEAKER_03]: data dashboards, trying to make more
effective decisions for the resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided we'd apply some data
techniques to understanding this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made charts of all the information,
all the propaganda, all the fears of what
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that became the metrics in the
dashboard that we were going to measure as
[SPEAKER_03]: we started to regulate I-502 in our
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also knew that the legislature and the
liquor board at that time, now the Liquor
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Board, had a really big job in
front of them to figure out how they were
[SPEAKER_03]: going to regulate this industry and what
it would look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were smart enough to know that this
was going to be an ever-changing play
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tell you this because it's important
in your jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your elected officials who are watching
this, whether they allow it or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: have seen dramatic changes in the
regulation of this industry in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the first 12 months, there was complete
overhaul of some of the regulations that
[SPEAKER_03]: affect us at the local level.
[SPEAKER_03]: For zoning and planning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That scares cities and municipalities off
from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like, how do I do something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I've got to pay attention and I've
got to reform it and I've got to go
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we faced those problems as well too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's important for you to know
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stabilization of regulation and when this
industry gets to that point, it's critical
[SPEAKER_03]: to its success.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ability for it to operate
everywhere in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started with We looked up the state
when we started applying for licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw like, I think it was 49
businesses had applied for a license in
[SPEAKER_03]: the city of Arlington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of freaked out at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought we could kind of beta test
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our dashboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know our metrics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think we know where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we might be overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we set our first sub-regulations under
the guideline of the first tier one,
[SPEAKER_03]: tier two, tier three canopy size.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our best structure that came
into place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because we're trying to build a
manufacturing community, and let me
[SPEAKER_03]: explain that initiative, which our
cannabis industry clearly understands now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to provide a balance of housing
and job growth in the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say job growth, I mean family
wage jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is $18 an hour or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want people to live and work in the
community because that's what makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: healthier community.
[SPEAKER_03]: When families aren't spending six to seven
hours community, and they're home,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they can take the kids to baseball
games, or they can participate in school
[SPEAKER_03]: activities, the family structure is
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighborhoods then grow from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The school system grows from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a real fundamental issue to
healthy communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to look at what the job
structure was.
[SPEAKER_03]: My story, I'm going to have to cut it
short.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have four and a half minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to speed it up here a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after figuring out that we have to
figure out what these 49 potential
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we would start, and how we would get
enough time to pay attention to our data
[SPEAKER_03]: dashboard and know what we were going with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did put some limitations on the first
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said we're only going to allow,
I believe it was 12 or 14 producer
[SPEAKER_03]: processors to come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had places and identified where they
will go, and we'll kind of study that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go forward a couple of years after,
you know, I think 10 of them had been in
[SPEAKER_03]: operation for at least 12 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat down with our data dashboard,
and all the propaganda literature,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't our experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had zero public safety calls on
cannabis operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean zero, not a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even somebody, you know, with an EMS
call for a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that that was pretty profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only issues that we did have,
and they were really relatively small,
[SPEAKER_03]: was odor issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our community wasn't used to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided, okay, you know, the Puget
Sound Clean Air Agency is taking a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: nother tact on that, but maybe we could
shore up some of our local regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: about carbon scrubbers and things where we
knew that producer processors would be
[SPEAKER_03]: closer to neighborhoods and it would be
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because really, now as elected officials,
all we want is we just don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want to dispel the
propaganda, and we want to try to find a
[SPEAKER_03]: way for this to work in the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the most effective things that we
did in our meeting was some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: research that we had done ended up being
with people who were producer processors,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the first ones in our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had a relationship with our
planning commission, which became a
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with our senior management,
and then became a relationship eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: with our elected people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we had a dozen producer processors in
our community, we really wanted to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: them, this is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a brand new emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rarely do we get to watch brand new
emerging industry develop from birth to
[SPEAKER_03]: maturation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get that opportunity very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see shared economy like Uber and
Lyft, but there are takeoffs on other
[SPEAKER_03]: industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all brand new, and it's really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's an opportunity and a need for
the industry to self-regulate in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you don't self-regulate,
government officials will know nothing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will regulate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that happens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we asked our producer processors to
form a coalition that's called the ACC,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Arlington Cannabis Coalition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair of our coalition is here today,
Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked a little bit about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sean said, wow, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, you know, because we don't
know what, we've disproved some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: propaganda.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest, we're still measuring data on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need you to understand the city,
and we need you to understand how to
[SPEAKER_03]: integrate into the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need you to understand what our
priorities are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to help us understand as a
business how you fit those priorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they formed a coalition maybe every
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through this, we brought in people to
speak, local legislators, state
[SPEAKER_03]: legislators, local law enforcement,
who has completely changed their mind on
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not going to tell you or their
kids that they're a fan of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they are no longer against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are no longer the arch enemy to legal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those global relationships,
if you are facing problems in your
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions, if you get things that keep
coming at you, and you don't know where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's coming from, really all I want you
here today is take a step to talk to the
[SPEAKER_03]: people who run your jurisdictions,
and listen to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out what their priorities are,
and help them figure out a way to show
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're helping meet those priorities
in their community.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally, I don't ask questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in this case, I'm going to ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: Erin, I'm going to ask a favor of you,
or me, and for this audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I facilitate a lot of things, and people
talk about stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they don't talk about concrete
steps they can take to make something
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have an interesting conversation with
knowing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you give this audience a couple
concrete steps that they can take in their
[SPEAKER_06]: life to have an impact?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the votes for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't figure anybody out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe one of the things would be
having targeted entrepreneurial training
[SPEAKER_09]: and assistant programs, showing people how
to do it, what are the steps that you have
[SPEAKER_09]: to go through, the hurdles that you have
to go through.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've already done it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've already experienced it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having entrepreneurial training classes,
showing people, especially people who want
[SPEAKER_09]: to get in, but are traumatized to get in,
that, look, this legal system is not
[SPEAKER_09]: coming to eat you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to be criminalized.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what the steps you have to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being intentional about having an
entrepreneurial training class.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing is policy of examinations,
like really examine policy for where
[SPEAKER_09]: you're located.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really look at the policies and see what
it is that's keeping certain people out,
[SPEAKER_09]: and figure out ways to maneuver those
policies, or influence those policies,
[SPEAKER_09]: to try to help get more and more inclusion
from people who, from a capital
[SPEAKER_09]: standpoint, cannot be involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that the normal model is
probably the best model out right now,
[SPEAKER_09]: but as Dominic said, that's leaving the
private sector to come up with a public
[SPEAKER_09]: issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was creating privacy to the
government law, so having us try to solve
[SPEAKER_09]: that, what are you fighting?
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know what they might do the next
day, especially to prove that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not against what Sessions said,
or a lot of people are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we did great, because I was
going to make people address what this
[SPEAKER_09]: thing is for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some other things are,
in being absolutely receptive,
[SPEAKER_09]: and don't take an angered stance,
or a definitive stance, in the state of
[SPEAKER_09]: Washington, we deal with a lot of
microaggressive racism in the state,
[SPEAKER_09]: and nobody wants to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the most racist states in
America.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be scared to hold the people around
you accountable for their words and their
[SPEAKER_09]: actions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Check them on their things, like,
dude, that's racist, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to be inclusive in this situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't take a timid stance on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really stand strong and say, look,
no, no, no, we can't continue this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Education programs, man, man, man,
man, please, please, your local education
[SPEAKER_09]: programs, because of the Cleary Act,
because of how the LCB set up where this
[SPEAKER_09]: tax stuff goes, our education systems are
not being funded.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those impoverished neighborhoods are
being hammered, hammered, hammered,
[SPEAKER_09]: hammered, and everybody has some kind of
store of recreation, whatever the three,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever it is, one of the three licenses
in an impoverished neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be intentional about your education
program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are your stores, your throws,
wherever your manufacturing is located.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be very intentional about getting involved
with the educational programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't see a hand at the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember correctly, you told me a
quick story about how one of the stores in
[SPEAKER_06]: town was then invited into the business
association of the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a blessed community up in Arlington,
because I think sometimes we really are
[SPEAKER_03]: open-minded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things when we're looking
at this new industry coming in is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, every other business in the
towns and the counties where you operate
[SPEAKER_03]: has some sort of association, a chamber of
commerce, a business association.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are really valuable and fundamental
pieces in the business culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they allow access to expertise and
problem-solving and sharing of ideas that
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see happening with the cannabis
coalition in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very closed model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very uncertain model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't know what it was facing in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the economist said, we had no idea what
the customer base would be, what supply
[SPEAKER_03]: and demand would look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of pressures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in our community, we set out to invite
a couple of the newer businesses into the
[SPEAKER_03]: larger service groups and to the chambers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also say something that really
impacted and changed other people's minds
[SPEAKER_03]: was the manufacturers were willing to do
tours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were willing to, that
visualization from Reaper Madness to a
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing-sophisticated industry was
priceless in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the cannabis coalition is viewed
as one of the in kind of industries in
[SPEAKER_03]: Arlington.
[SPEAKER_03]: They participate in rotary.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work with me on fundraising for the
appropriate causes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody out there thinks that
you're making a million dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to tell you, I hear this
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, they're just raking in the
bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't understand your business
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand the regulations and
the taxations on your businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not making a million dollars a
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your expenses to your income is incredibly
mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of stories not told.
[SPEAKER_03]: But integrating, sorry, integrating into a
normal business culture, in a community
[SPEAKER_03]: can go a long way to what I think I've
heard every panel up here talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: today, which is educating people about the
truth in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: If this industry is making a million
dollars a month, then I need to raise our
[SPEAKER_06]: rates from zero to something.
[SPEAKER_08]: First question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Todd, you mentioned you had shared your
report to the LCB at the meeting.
[SPEAKER_08]: But did you share your report on the store
path or your thoughts or what you shared
[SPEAKER_08]: with us?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a follow-up to that, if you don't
mind, if you can provide your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_08]: how to expand access without diluting the
market share of pre-existing retail
[SPEAKER_08]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I talked to the LCB a few different
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the first instance, it was at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another instance, it was at the
502.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they had already made their mind
up, so to speak, whether I said whatever I
[SPEAKER_02]: said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm for the free market,
per se, but I was pressing them to let the
[SPEAKER_02]: market expand as it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an unfettered type of way, where
commerce to the market can come and
[SPEAKER_02]: leavers lead as they go out of business in
a functioning market.
[SPEAKER_02]: To guide the retail system, I place the
idea upon, with entering into a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, if you look at how many
places can you buy aspirin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that the retail establishment
should be diluted that much, but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously a demand for medical products
that, in my mind's eye, should be more
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible than to go to one of the few
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I recently did a look at how far
anyone in the state had to drive to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: a, how many people were within 20 miles of
the campus?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't published that data yet,
but I will put that out at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with the demographics team.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the market, in my mind's
eye, should be a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is a lot bigger than we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of smug in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there another part of your question
that I just totally avoided?
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I wasn't specific enough,
and if you don't mind me shouting it out,
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at a cap of stores, and you
specifically said that cap is,
[SPEAKER_08]: in other words, BS.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we adjust from here?
[SPEAKER_08]: We already have licensees going,
we have the other issues, but we need
[SPEAKER_08]: access.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we implement that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an idea on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, in my mind, it should be
based, it should just be population-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to me that it was quite
simple that you look at, you just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have some proxy of what the demand looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do it, like, how many bars there
are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the alcohol and the marijuana,
in my mind's eye, aren't even similar in
[SPEAKER_02]: any, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you answer medical, then it's
like, how many stores you have that
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes a whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think, you know, we had a bunch
of, I mean, at the time of the 502 Botech
[SPEAKER_02]: study came out, there were 470-something
medical establishments paying taxes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: How a study got out that said 333,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: WTF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to... And how they were
dispersed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and how they were dispersed,
it's sort of, I don't, that's like...
[SPEAKER_05]: Canopy sites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or something that I had to call,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the retail licenses, where,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can't decide, but that's,
you know, I can't...
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that that would be all comers
to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you want to try to grow it,
grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in Washington, so it's going to
be expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try this in Washington,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a number of years ago, business
associations were trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_06]: much of a business type could exist in a
population base.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they came up with is a very rough
unscientific term.
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, they would take the
population base and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: six to maybe 8% of that number is how many
pizza shops you can support.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how many garages you can support.
[SPEAKER_06]: But not scientifically by any means.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what they were using to say,
we have a membership in this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can support about this amount of
people, technically.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barb, thank you so much for sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really admire you, and I love your
intellectual curiosity statement,
job-seeking statement.
I have friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And which led me to this question,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the City of Arlington has taken a very
unorthodox approach to embrace this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry that has proven itself to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you treat new employees?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you drug test and exclude marijuana?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you still adhering to excluding
anyone who pops for marijuana from
[SPEAKER_04]: employment within the city?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do still have a no-tolerance policy for
drugs in the City of Arlington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably will be there for a while
until the industry is more accepted and
[SPEAKER_03]: normalized into the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a question for anyone who
wants to answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Truth and reconciliation commissions were
done in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw Erin went to South Africa under
this bio.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was a solution the government had
to deal with long-standing structural
[SPEAKER_07]: violence that was in the laws between
blacks and whites in Africa, South Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm wondering if maybe states,
governments, local places could do such
[SPEAKER_07]: things, get law enforcement people,
affect community members, to have
[SPEAKER_07]: listening sessions and truth and
reconciliation to kind of help us process
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the long-standing social trauma
that we've lived under that doesn't get
[SPEAKER_07]: voiced as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the point of drug testing has a lot to
do with insurance, the Insurance Directly
[SPEAKER_07]: Workplace Act and workplace insurance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so those laws need to change so that
you don't have to have a drug testing
[SPEAKER_07]: policy to get workplace insurance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't say that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's addressed to you, but truth
and reconciliation commission requires
[SPEAKER_00]: political representation to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a word going into this
conversation with Erin, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: expungement of criminal records.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of California actually has a
process for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state actually had a bill to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But enthusiasm for that died in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently the lobbyists were not terribly
motivated to pursue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Spokane apparently tried to pass
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you could do, industry,
is attach criminal record expungement to
[SPEAKER_00]: your next legislative poverty list.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attach it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for industry, you can vote for
expungement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can vote for industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to a partner and say,
today we're expunging criminal records
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will have a bigger effect than
just if you're employed in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: industry because your criminal record
prevents you from being employed in other
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just going to say that the truth
and reconciliation commission,
[SPEAKER_09]: it sounds good on paper, but all that was
was a way for white men to get out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: way to get an excuse for killing black
men.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to sit there at the table and
admit to black families, yes, I killed
[SPEAKER_09]: this person.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where I dumped the body.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they would never have counted.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know my truth and reconciliation.
So I did it.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks like our last question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I didn't touch the mic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Primarily to quote, and with respect to
the notion of access to the product,
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been forecasting and estimating the
size of this market since it started.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a dynamic emerged about midway through
last year that was independent of the SSB
[SPEAKER_10]: 5052 implementation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it struck me that it appeared as if a
significant number of consumers that had
[SPEAKER_10]: been using the regulated system were
beginning to go elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they're stopping using it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you look at the transactional
data across time and standardize it
[SPEAKER_10]: against the population characteristics of
the local areas, it's very clear that
[SPEAKER_10]: something happened about midway through
not last year, the year before,
[SPEAKER_10]: that just started kicking in bad time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, I think this market is
underperforming by about 20% just on a
[SPEAKER_10]: revenue basis, a transactional basis,
largely driven by the lack of retail
[SPEAKER_10]: access.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though there's 556 licenses
allocated, there were fewer than 400
[SPEAKER_10]: stores that sold more than $1,000 of
product last calendar year.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And fewer than half of those have a
medical certification for their market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So from the government's perspective,
from the governor's perspective,
[SPEAKER_10]: if revenue is important in this state,
particularly when it's a harm reduction
[SPEAKER_10]: strategy, if you're shipping on
recreational land or other use to do this
[SPEAKER_10]: product, why is it acceptable that an
agency of the government can use crap
[SPEAKER_10]: science, which is demonstratively just
ridiculous, false, wrong, to slap on
[SPEAKER_10]: something that basically is, this is how
many liquor stores we used to regulate,
[SPEAKER_10]: so that's how many can.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the stores we're gonna regulate were
staffed for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: To decrease the revenue, and at the same
time, while forcing medical patients and
[SPEAKER_10]: medical providers to either go into the
regulated system or to be criminalized
[SPEAKER_10]: themselves, and then to basically shut off
the spigot through regulation and I think
[SPEAKER_10]: punitive legislation in a few instances,
so that fewer than 5% of the producers
[SPEAKER_10]: have produced medical product,
less than 1% of the product sold was
[SPEAKER_10]: medical last year, less state sales tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: And fewer than maybe one fifth of the
access points we had at the Green Cross
[SPEAKER_10]: area are currently able to serve patients
as patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a broken system in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can make more money and we can serve
the needs of the patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think the governor might be
interested in that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Jay is interested in the
marketplace, whether he's down at this
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental level or the micro level of
this juncture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know because, as I've said before,
actually not here, but the entire amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of revenue to the state is dust and wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry is very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do they care that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They care only as much as the money goes
up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aerospace, they really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech, they care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, no, the reality is that when they
started releasing the licenses,
[SPEAKER_02]: I jokingly did a little calculation and
said, well in 11 years, they'll actually
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the 233 licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they still aren't there,
but now we can get to 530, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really weird, I don't
understand what they're doing with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will say that it was when Portland
Welfaree made it legal to grow at home,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got on the phone with some producers,
I don't know if anybody, I just called
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon, sort of the guys that were in
Vancouver, and I said, hey, what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of them went, well,
I just lost 50% of my business that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so recently I was down in Portland and
one of the guys I was with came back and
[SPEAKER_02]: he goes, man, I just got an eight for 17
bucks and it's some of the best I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, that would have been 56 bucks
in Seattle where he's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So luckily nobody's bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my own personal opinion, take away
whatever my affiliation, I think what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to the medical industry is
totally unethical and immoral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to hear.
Good to hear.
Good to hear.
Good to hear.
Good to hear.
Good to hear.
