[SPEAKER_01]: The best farmers are connected to the land
physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relationship is incredibly intimate as
the farmer tends to the plants and the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, and the earth returns food,
fiber, and flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer integrates themselves into the
living system of the field and becomes one
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature's cycles and rhythms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the style of cannabis farming that
is the pride of the Emerald Triangle area
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to speak to one such
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan Adkisson is an internationally
respected proponent and educator of
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotic growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has developed large-scale anaerobic
solid-state fermentation for both the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: dairy industry and the cannabis industry,
going back decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was mentored by both the revered Eddie
Lep and the late Jack Herrera,
[SPEAKER_01]: whose micro-organism research and
development Alan carries on to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is co-founder of the Probiotic Farmers
Alliance Group on Facebook and is also
[SPEAKER_01]: founder of Grokashi, a specialty living
fertilizer provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in a banana belt region of the
Emerald Triangle near Laytonville,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and today's
show is packed with insight into both
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and humans, historical context
going all the way back to Roman times,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some awfully fine storytelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sit back, slow down, and enjoy this
week's episode of Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, before we go into the meat
of the show, I totally want you to talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about where you live,
because, you know, in the short time that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been getting to know each other,
you've been telling me about where you
[SPEAKER_01]: live there in Northern California,
and it just sounds like a totally amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: place to, well, not only live,
but grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you just tell everybody about it a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in what's known as a banana belt
region here in Mendocino, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a town called Laytonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at the bottom of a peak called
Cotto Peak, and let me think, four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: of your past Emerald Cup winners are my
neighbors here in our neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the backside of my property is
probably one of the most well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards in the region, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that many great Emerald
Cup winners are coming from that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people trying to come there to grow
because of the additional sun that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get, or is there something special with
the local soil, or do you just get less,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, less mist so that it's less
likely to get mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's the magic there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that at a 4500 foot peak
behind us, the onshore flow splits and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes around us, and so the microclimate
here is very unique, and that's what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it possible to grow grapes in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it would be a great region also
for, you know how like shade-grown coffees
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that are preferred?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have kind of the same type of
climate here, and when I first moved here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the property above me, it was dominated by
the cartel grouse, and after the land hold
[SPEAKER_00]: had gotten in trouble, a few times,
they needed some people that could move
[SPEAKER_00]: onto that property and, you know,
exclude, you know, the cartel from coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I brought in, I put,
are you familiar with Leo Stone from
[SPEAKER_00]: Aficionado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally, Leo and Gene, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Leo was working for an old friend
of mine, and their partnership was just
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting up, and, you know, Leo was in
the army, so I put Leo and another friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine that was ex special forces on the
property above me, and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: Aficionado was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad I asked, and, you know,
there's something about having your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in this shadow of the mountain or,
you know, essentially being protected by
[SPEAKER_01]: the mountain since the mountain is
splitting the clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some romance in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know what I did to be so
blessed as to have the universe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, let me have the property that
I'm living on now, but it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: place, and I'm just honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk some probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we talk a lot about
probiotic growing on this show,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, for a lot of growers still
using bottled nutrients, that term may not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they know that it's some kind of
natural growing, but because they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: used to using bottles and may not have
done the research yet, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the term doesn't mean much for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain the frustration that
many cannabis growers have with bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and why a probiotic approach is
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing that many of us realized
is that, because, I mean, most of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from the bottle background,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally came here from Sacramento,
and I worked for and with Dale and Molly
[SPEAKER_00]: Fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taught me how to grow with,
like, earth juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I moved up here, you know,
I kind of fell in like everyone else and
[SPEAKER_00]: started, you know, using bottles because
they were so easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the appearance, you know, the bag
appeal was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what came from some of like the
original 321 mix from General Hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: created some incredible, incredible crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just had to really have your your
flesh game on, you know, strong so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it wasn't so noticeable that
they were grown with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, though, you know,
especially if one has any kind of a vision
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that, it kind of keeps
you from from going that route any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you a story, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the dairy industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the dairy industry for roughly 25
years in the Sacramento Valley and up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Yakima Valley in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran my dad's subsidiary company up
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my customers, we were we
covered silage pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that we were instrumental in,
you know, getting the farmers to adopt
[SPEAKER_00]: solid state fermentation with their their
feed for silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fancy way to say we covered it
and fermented it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working at this mega dairy up in
Washington state called the Ord dairy and
[SPEAKER_00]: Henry Ord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He decided that he wanted to have the
runoff from our fermenting of the silage
[SPEAKER_00]: bits go into his manure lagoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is instead of the manure
lagoon, you know, being the typical one
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, everything dead all around
it, his manure lagoon was it was starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to attract them, you know, frogs,
ducks, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we the only thing we could figure was
that maybe it was because the the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: from using the lactic acids and things to
ferment the silage was in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: bioremediating some of the toxins in the
manure lagoons that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep wildlife from coming typically around
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did some scientific testing and
fairly quickly, the Ord dairies,
[SPEAKER_00]: his manure lagoon and his dairy was no
longer, you know, regarded as part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic superfund site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we kind of developed you
know, way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like nineteen ninety three
or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory of beneficial runoff coming
from these silage pits that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculating and fermenting with lactic
acid bacterias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with some of the best
nutritionists from UC Davis because
[SPEAKER_00]: through fermentation, we could make the
food more bioavailable for the animals
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we took and we used the same theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working with Reverend Eddie
Lett, you know, at the healing fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: the famous healing fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to buy this 40 acres and
across the highway from his main facility
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow the huge garden that everyone
knows, you know, it was so famous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me, Alan, how do you think we
should irrigate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, you've got that canal
right there that runs through the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 40 acres and goes directly to Clear
Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, but if we do that,
then, you know, we're going to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble with EPA from the runoff from the
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, wait a minute, let's let's
go back and use, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that I used in the dairy
industry and claim beneficial runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we'll do is we'll test the
canal and prove, you know, that the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: from the crops was beneficial to Clear
Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It proved out to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically made a 40 acre ebb and flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty radical, actually,
you know, not only reputationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: since cannabis runoff has got such a bad
reputation and agricultural runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: generally has got a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that your runoff could actually
be beneficial to the natural environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and not throw it out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty radical thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, not only that, it would be,
in my opinion, proper risk management,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Test your runoff and prove scientifically
that it's beneficial for the local
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if some state regulator or
someone wanted to come and pull your
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing, it would give you standing in a
court of law to keep them at arm's length
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep your operation running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's probably worthwhile to
unpack the idea of the fermented materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're putting on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, essentially what you're doing is
you are adding microbial communities to
[SPEAKER_01]: both the grow and then the surrounding
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of just pounding your crops
with NPK that when it runs off,
[SPEAKER_01]: it throws nature out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just adding those, you're
actually adding the basic communities of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they run off your property,
they're just providing the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: communities of life in a different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I would add one thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just add the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add the microbes and the
prebiotics that are necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're breeding, you want to meet
every epigenetic need that they might
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want super microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of diet, what are these
prebiotics that you add that gives them
[SPEAKER_01]: this buffet so that they can go hog wild?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you understand oneness with the
soil and the microbes and you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that you yourself are, you're
predominantly made of microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I thought I'm going to treat my
fermentations and my microbes the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that a naturopathic doctor would treat a
female with a fertility issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I make like our grow Kashi
product, I add a multivitamin mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: complex and lots of other, you know,
like fresh juiced beet juice and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really go out of my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat my 300 pound fermentation barrel
nutritionally as if it was a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were treating that person for a
fertility issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're, you're creating a
beneficial environment for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if, if the prebiotics that we use
in our, in our solid state fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't used up during the fermentation,
then they still are basically in the
[SPEAKER_00]: toolbox of the microbes to be handed out
later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we're going to talk more about the
particular fermentations that you prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: in the second set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but before we wrap up the first set
here, you know, we started by talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the bottles and the three,
two, one, and the, like the really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful you know, bag, beautiful flowers
that you got with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said you shifted to the,
you know, the probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that there's a lot of growers
who are concerned that they'll have lesser
[SPEAKER_01]: yields or that the flowers will have less
bag appeal from moving from bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to nutrient teas and such that
we're talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what have you seen from others
who have gotten brave and made the jump
[SPEAKER_01]: from what they are, you know, they're
comfortable with in the bottle to
[SPEAKER_01]: something more natural?
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're talking about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, can I tell you that I didn't
just make the jump because of ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: although that's a very strong point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the jump because, um, I was an
Emerald Cup judge and I was thinking what
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world is the difference in the
winners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, I'm pretty competitive guy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was thinking that it might mean
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because in wine, that's the
difference between something that has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, complex aroma and taste is,
you know, high nutrient density is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know what a low density,
a low nutrient density wine is called?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I said, how can I test this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I called up a company called Natural Check
and I talked to the CEO and he actually
[SPEAKER_00]: owns the company too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, um, he said, you know,
Alan, I've been waiting 20 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody from cannabis to call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to share with you is that
in my 20 years in the field, I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen anything grown with synthetics reach
a high nutrient density level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh my God, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have access to all of these entries from
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we, you and I could figure out a
way to reconstitute the herb and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get, uh, use your refractor meter
to, to get a Bricks rating on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, okay, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found is that all of our
winners had a very high nutrient density
[SPEAKER_00]: content compared to the rest of the
contestants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were, they were super packed with,
I mean, life force for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, they had a way more trace
minerals in them than the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the plants that and the
entries that, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, never stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, huh, well, what's,
how, how can I reach this nutrient density
[SPEAKER_00]: level?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and well, it's through natural
farming practices through basically
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the plant to live in symbiosis
with these myceliums and these probiotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, fast forward a few
years, I'm working with, uh, Eddie and
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how do I say this without sounding
crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good with crazy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with, I knew Eddie for
seven years and I hung out and I watched
[SPEAKER_00]: people come and go and Eddie had this
famous poster on his stairs that showed
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Illuminati families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was always like, those are the bad
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, but Eddie,
you see that Keller name right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Keller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, we're no different than the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those families, 5% of those
families are good people because I fully
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that we're no different than the
microbes were made out of 5% or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, roughly of us are a pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, sociopaths and
psychopaths, 5% of us are probiotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, uh, people that are more
empathic and then 90% roughly of us of our
[SPEAKER_00]: species are uh, well, they're
opportunistic, just like the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to say, but I believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, well, I'm a Keller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on your thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that all those families and
everyone in them are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying, you've known me for how
many years you really think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm an evil person just cause I
come from one of those families.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, no matter of fact, I want to
share something with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, be back here next, uh,
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and people that are in the know,
know that at Eddie's farm, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonally, they had like a tea ceremony
where it was like a, a T for a
[SPEAKER_00]: Southwestern shaman, you know,
mushrooms and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go, I went back down there and
I'm a guy who, uh, I'm an old bouncer and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I had only smoked pot and, uh,
drank alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always steered clear of hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had never done mushrooms or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I brought, uh, I brought my wife
down with me because Eddie wanted me to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay the night, you know, and do this tea,
some tea ceremony at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also was a guy who had built,
you know, three, three companies previous
[SPEAKER_00]: to getting into, you know, the cannabis
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did that, you know, with like
Tony Robbins using his programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that if you're going to go
meet someone important, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very best way that you could honor
them is to try to, uh, come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: great question for them that you think
they might want to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know, you know, I guess if
you're going to do mushrooms and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom tea, maybe you're trying to meet
God or something or nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so earlier in the day, my brother who
was doing great with the sub irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: planters, these earth boxes, he said,
um, Alan, I think, uh, he's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother is, he said, I think these,
uh, earth boxes have something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: like the technology behind the hanging
gardens of Babylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go down there and I'm going to go to
this tea ceremony and my wife and I go
[SPEAKER_00]: upstairs to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come back down, do the tea ceremony,
go back up to go to sleep, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at about one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote down on a piece of paper,
uh, how did the hanging gardens of Babylon
[SPEAKER_00]: operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fell asleep to what looked like,
um, a stack of different colors moving
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had this, we, the, the,
first of all, it was like a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, if you should accept this
mission, you know, and okay, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I had this dream and it was like,
you know, how, uh, in a computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put a zip drive in, like
nothing's there and you put the zip drive
[SPEAKER_00]: in and it's all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of saw, I didn't kind of saw,
I got like the, the business plan on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on how those gardens operated and how they
used solid state fermentations because
[SPEAKER_00]: those people in those times were the kings
of fermentation and how they used,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, these sub irrigated planters,
but the sub irrigated planter really
[SPEAKER_00]: represented a gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you did is there was like a
fairly soilless medium in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You built a mycelial mat on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put your manure on top of that,
but then they, they covered it with a skin
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the mycelium and the things that
are normally light pruned are no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: light pruned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that because they were in a desert
region, the thing used about a third of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water that any other type of farming
would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me two years to talk myself into
trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I, when I did try it,
it not only worked, but it worked
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started, uh, Eddie was in prison
about that time and we started doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology patent for what it meant to be
probiotically farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, let me see where I can go from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working with a patent attorney
down in the Bay area who, um, apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to some friends about the work we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing you know, we had,
uh, some people from the alcohol in and
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco industry contacting us and they
were all friendly at first they wanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause we were doing this patent
methodology patent in the name of humanity
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, you don't want,
like information like that to be taken and
[SPEAKER_00]: shelved away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they contacted us and they wanted
to give us like $5 million for Eddie's
[SPEAKER_00]: likeness and all rights to probiotically
farmed in the methodology patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they would not in any way
guarantee that they wouldn't shelf the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we told them no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden they started
mentioning some friends of ours that were
[SPEAKER_00]: in um, free energy that had, had,
um, gag orders and things placed upon
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were kind of threatening that
they could not only place a gag order on
[SPEAKER_00]: us somehow, but they could make Eddie's
time in prison rougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at first they're like,
yeah, sign with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we could put the legal team on and
maybe even get Eddie out of prison a
[SPEAKER_00]: little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They changed their tune at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter of fact, they just became dicks
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called Eddie and Eddie said,
um, Alan, I want you, if you're down,
[SPEAKER_00]: go up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was headed to the Emerald cup that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, make it public knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Tim allowed me to, uh, do a quick
workshop and I just taught everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we knew right then and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a very fortunate thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not only for everybody who was
there and for the ideas behind the tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: but geez, I mean, that could have gotten
bottled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that point forward, that was a pretty
brave move just to decide to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody all at once and, uh,
and get that information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had some plants that were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some videos that you saw on
discovery channel where, um, Tim Blake was
[SPEAKER_00]: walking through one of his greenhouses and
he was petting this one plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plant that, that I planted that
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Hey, I want to hear more of the
story, but we need to take our first short
[SPEAKER_01]: break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Alan Atkinson,
founder of the pro biotic farmers Alliance
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like podcasts like shaping fire,
chances are that you'll like audio books
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like with podcasts, audio books speak
to you, tell you stories and teach you
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing audible.com has an offer
that I want to tell you about right now.

[SPEAKER_01]: the link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire and I'm
your host, shango low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our guest this week is Alan Atkinson,
founder of the probiotic farmers Alliance
[SPEAKER_01]: on Facebook and grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking
about, you know, the history of probiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, coming to the cannabis world and,
and how you essentially made that
[SPEAKER_01]: information, you know, open source at an
Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I want to hit before we go
into what, you know, some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: preferential nutrient fermentations are
is, you know, there's a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be weighing using synthetic
nutrients to get really bag worthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, flowers with really
great baggage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about, you know,
like going to the probiotic route,
[SPEAKER_01]: which takes a little bit more effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you never really like locked down
about the flower itself, why you think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's better than the synthetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if you, if you'd hit that for me
before we move on, I'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my opinion that when you let a
mycelial matte dictate the delivery,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much, how much nutrients and exactly
what nutrients they take.
[SPEAKER_00]: and trace minerals are delivered to the
plant, that's when you can achieve these
[SPEAKER_00]: very high nutrient density levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some people, they fall victim
when they first try to go organic and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand that it's gonna take your
soil one, two, sometimes maybe three crops
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in no-till know this, but by the
time your soil gets up to its second or
[SPEAKER_00]: third crop, that's when you really start
competing heavily with the same yields
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would have attained from our
bottled crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started doing this to get
traction with people, we called it
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic hydroponics through probiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on a series that you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into the Probiotic Farmers
Alliance and you type in depth on a dime,
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed people every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, here's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna show you every day what we did
on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to grow a crop of the Cinex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some other plants, but Cinex was
mainly what I was working with because it
[SPEAKER_00]: had been heavily tested by SC labs and
other labs, so we knew what to expect from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grew it out using our probiotic
methodology, or what we call probiotically
[SPEAKER_00]: farmed with the SIPS, it set new records
for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this day, now that was around a year
and a half ago, and one of the top clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: up here is owned by Tim Blake,
and it's the Healing Harvest Farms Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've held the top price point for a year
and a half with the Cinex from that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that we grew in front of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to alleviate people's fears that
they would not be able to compete if they
[SPEAKER_00]: took this route.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the bag appeal the same visually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when describing synthetic and
indoor versus probiotic and outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels like they both produce decent
flowers, but the indoor synthetic stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like an Olympian and sometimes looks
a little strange because it's so grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: a super unnatural, artificial kind of way,
but the product you get is still amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: and wins insane awards and is enjoyable to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got the other kind of folks,
think of maybe a high school cross-country
[SPEAKER_01]: runner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also super fit, but they run on country
roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're obviously a fit person,
but they're a little more natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both incredible athletes,
but they appear differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the probiotic stuff, even when it
smells good, does it still have the
[SPEAKER_01]: coloration that you get with synthetics,
or do you give up a little bit of that for
[SPEAKER_01]: a nose and a taste that'll blow everybody
away?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we surpass the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the statements that we made early
on is that the truth is in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our community, one of the cool things
about our community is I don't care who is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the smoking circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be standing there with Kyle or Ed
or rest his soul, Jack or Eddie,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not like typical wine snobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some kid walks up to our circle and has
an herb that'll blow our mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's cool about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in our industry talk the
talk, but if you can show up with herb
[SPEAKER_00]: that blows people's minds, that's walking
the walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to be successful doing that,
but now with the PFA, we're coming up on
[SPEAKER_00]: 20,000 members there, and there are people
that are actually using our logo,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing probiotically, to establish
themselves in their local markets because
[SPEAKER_00]: people are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going around at the clubs looking
and asking, okay, where can I get
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotically farmed materials?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say the proof is in the smoke,
if it wasn't, they would call bullshit on
[SPEAKER_00]: us, and they would have a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I saw a PFA logo on somebody's grow,
I would be attracted to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, it's like a seal of approval,
the things that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be real clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Probiotic Farmers Alliance is a group
on Facebook about 20,000 people strong
[SPEAKER_01]: where everybody is discussing in detail
these techniques that we're merely
[SPEAKER_01]: skimming the surface of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I got turned on to probiotics
and met Alan, luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you should check that out if
you're into this topic that we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your logo itself, the purple triangle,
if I saw that on somebody's grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would immediately be into that stuff
because I know that it's grown in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that I aspire to grow better at,
and it probably tastes great, and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not gonna have any garbage in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and even the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the group designed the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group started as just beta testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took 25 testers, and when you say that
I'm the founder of PFA, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: technically, I'm a co-founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Fong, people know him as M4K at
Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with them at the time,
and he and I started it with the 25 first
[SPEAKER_00]: people in what's now the PFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were from the Gage Green testers,
and when we were done beta testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had 300 or 400 members by then of
Bokashi, because we had the members help
[SPEAKER_00]: us formulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to know, of the top growers,
what would you want in your Bokashi if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were gonna have a dream Bokashi?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he helped me form that, and that's
where it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to have the oral history to
be straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, so we've got about, oh,
about four or five minutes here before our
[SPEAKER_01]: next break, and I'd love to have you
describe how to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's lots of different nutrient
teas that can be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just give a simple recipe that
people can start with so that they can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, see what it's like to make their
own fermentation and treat their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: with it so that, you know, so we have like
a place to start for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully they get excited by the
results and then they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start researching more and join the
probiotic farmers' alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give us something simple that people
can start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what's local in their
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you had, these skills can
really be looked at as a survival skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I do if I only had horse
manure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what would I do if I only had rabbit
manure or llama or alpaca?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you would make a tea out of it
and basically make a beverage that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to feed to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd use a, one problem with manure teas
and things like that is there could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen hiding in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we depend on competitive exclusion to
out-compete those pathogens by using our
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite probiotics, which is like the
lactic acids and the lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, look and find what's around
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jack Herr wanted me to use sugar
sources from different crops grown locally
[SPEAKER_00]: around Clear Lake at the time,
too, for biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes we had plums available
to us and all this, but later on we
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to use beets because, I mean,
a beet is a sugar source that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: grows right in the mycelial layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I also thought I wanted to make
sure that the streptomyces was in our
[SPEAKER_00]: bokoshis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew it was going to be in the wheat
because I use a Mennonite grown organic
[SPEAKER_00]: hard red winter wheat brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as a backup, because my theory is
one, you know, one is, two is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: one is none.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that if I use the beet and the
wheat, I'm going to make sure that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of IMOs and especially the
streptomyces in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that streptomyces in the LAB are going
to out-compete any pathogens that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding in other components that you can
find to put in your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to break this down even more basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that you'd take a five
gallon bucket and cut up some beets and
[SPEAKER_01]: put your hard winter wheat in there and
fill it with water and put a bubbler in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and let it sit for three days and let it
start to ferment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is it that simple?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I put it all in my solid state
fermentation first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I can take my solid
state fermentation and put it in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wouldn't use a bubbler
because these are more anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like if you were making a beer
or a kibos, you wouldn't use a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you say solid state, is that more
of what I think of like traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just meaning no added liquids?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's added liquids, but it's at
roughly a 60% moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mix it up until it's good and wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good rule of thumb would be when you
make your solid state fermentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: add fluid until you can just barely
squeeze some drops of water out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was the same indicator that we
used for silage when I was working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutritionists from Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would tell me, Alan, check the silage
while they're bringing it in from the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields and let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can squeeze water and it rolls down
your wrist, call me because I'll have the
[SPEAKER_00]: truck stop harvesting the crop from the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mix the beets and you mix the wheat
and you add just a little bit of fluid and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get it all turned up and you just let
it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long would you let that sit and
ferment before you go ahead and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into water to make your tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with a solid state fermentation,
the best way to tell if it's done is wait
[SPEAKER_00]: for the pressure to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then number two, when you take that
material, add water, let it sit overnight
[SPEAKER_00]: and your pH goes to four or just under
four, you know that you've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you break out that part you said you
ferment until it stops?
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, when you're making a
fermentation like beer or anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know, the pressure that is
the off gassing that occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait for the off gassing that is occurring
to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is that I mean, in the old days,
I used to put a balloon on the barrel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on a barb and it would blow up
the balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the balloon stopped blowing
up and it contracted, I would know the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation was complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I just, you know, I know in
these food grade barrels how many days it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't I don't have to, you know,
do that research anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I when I make, you know,
sauerkraut and stuff, I use a plug on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of my carboy that, you know,
it's an S curve and it's got water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can tell that there's bubbles going
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just throw one of those on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that stops giving off gases,
you know that you're you're good to put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do just immediately put it in
water, mix it up and put it on the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I would think that going from the
dry state to be in the water state,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't use it right away,
that you're going to choke off the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that are living in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do at that point is dry
it and then you can store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you've got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did Joseph make the wheat stay good
for seven years for the Pharaoh?
[SPEAKER_00]: He fermented it and then he dried it and
then they put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so once it's on the shelf,
when you want to reactivate it and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: on your crops, do you take it out and just
put it, you know, mix it right in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you making even even bothering to
make a tea out of it at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we want to do is have a
multipurpose product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could if we make a tea out of
it, then we can apply it foliarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we apply it, you know, as the tea,
we're not really putting down the trace
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals onto the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could go both routes, make a tea
out of some of it and then go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast your Bokashi onto the soil
surface roughly every 10 days to two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, depending on how big the plant is,
because we're not just giving the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the soil the probiotics that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving it the probiotics that it
needs and the prebiotics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the food for the microbes to keep the
microbes happy and very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we if we can keep the like the
streptomyces in bloom and we can see it
[SPEAKER_00]: grow growing, then we know that it is both
making the plant's immune system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil's immune system, everything that it
can be at its zenith and also that the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis will occur at the highest
rate possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before before we go to break,
I just want to say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is, you know, hopefully at this
point we have gotten folks excited about,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that there's alternatives to the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can create these, you know,
these ultra rich microbe communities and
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium communities in your substrate and
they will make the most amazing plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've ever grown, though it might
take you a cycle or two or three to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but the goal here is to to let people
know to have faith that there is another
[SPEAKER_01]: solution other than the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have the best grows of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you should read some and
probably join the Probiotic Farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: Alliance Facebook group so that you can
learn and share information with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you'd be producing a much
better flower that's better for the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, you get to have some
fun learning along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, let's go to our second
commercial and then come back and talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about the business side of
probiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Alan Atkisson,
founder of the Probiotics Farmers Alliance
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information, go to shapingfire
.com forward slash natural enemies or
[SPEAKER_01]: simply click on their banner in this
week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shangalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess this week is Alan Atkinson,
founder of the Probiotic Farmers Alliance
[SPEAKER_01]: and Grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know that you,
your life's work as far as probiotics go
[SPEAKER_01]: was the development and the releasing of
Grow Kashi, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your own special blend of Bo Kashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had never heard of Bo
Kashi before I joined the Probiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers Alliance to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you take a moment and kind of
explain what it is and how it works to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of bring people up to speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I know when I first,
when I used it for the first time after
[SPEAKER_01]: you gave me a sample of an emerald cup,
I freaked out a little bit because like
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff I had never seen happened
in my soil, you know, all this out of
[SPEAKER_01]: control mycelium and unidentified microbes
and colorful but beneficial molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you go ahead and just talk a
little bit about what Bo Kashi is from a
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotic level and we'll kind of just
take it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the Bo Kashi would be a supplement
that you add to your soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you could take advantage of
competitive exclusion out on the crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Roman times, you know, it was used,
you know how you had the different
[SPEAKER_00]: deities.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the deities in Roman times,
one of the gods was called Lacturnus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lacturnus was in, you know,
we know it as lactic acid bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was in charge of the safeguarding
and the storage of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, the streptomyces mycelium
we're talking about, I'm still looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: more links so that I can really nail this
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was known as St. Anthony's Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone knows about St. Anthony's
Fire, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ergodism and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets into the joints of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cure for St. Anthony's Fire was
the St. Anthony's Snow, this actinomyces,
[SPEAKER_00]: streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we know is that when all the
wheat back in those days was put away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was a labor force that had
to ferment it and put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why it was done by
hand is that as these Roman soldiers were
[SPEAKER_00]: returning, well, let me say this to you,
when you create a soldier, you must create
[SPEAKER_00]: a psychopath because that soldier has to
be able to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: To re-indoctrinate that soldier into
society, what you need is some sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: empathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reinstall empathy into that
soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they would have had this
work done by hand by these soldiers that
[SPEAKER_00]: were having problems that were coming
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, direct exposure to the hands and
the feet with the lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we can go to Google
Scholar and look this up and find that
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD treatments, they are scientifically
valid, PTSD treatments that include these
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics that we're talking about,
especially lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reinstalls empathy in people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought is, well, let's do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get myself, I'll surround myself
with veterans that, you know, have had or
[SPEAKER_00]: still have PTSD and have them make these
products and watch the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've watched is a real turnaround
in a lot of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked with a small business
administration and will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide therapy to these guys through
their involvement in this Bokashi or
[SPEAKER_00]: Rokashi making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also nice because, you know,
we're always looking with the veterans to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide retraining when they come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working in solid state fermentation
technologies, that's a great avenue for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you're getting these folks who
are, you know, skilled and really good at
[SPEAKER_01]: project management and getting things
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're teaching them how to use those
skills in a way that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good for the neighbors, good for the
neighborhood, good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an amazing retraining program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the idea that them working with
the labs and probably handling the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: with their hands as well, the fact that
that's all healing them and regrowing
[SPEAKER_01]: empathy in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really profound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually know you were going like
that far with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty heavy duty stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to share some news that I got just
this last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of my, I'm folding the Rokashi
company in and Rokashi is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: product under the plant candy label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant candy also will have liquid
you-mates that are revolutionary because
[SPEAKER_00]: our partners hold like 170 patents in the
gold mining industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the problems with liquid
you-mates is heavy metal content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we run these you-mates through
gold mining equipment, we can pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the heavy metals and get them out
of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's cool is that one of my
partners has a direct avenue with four of
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest oil companies right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if you will, oil pipelines,
you know, they're prone to rupture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we found the average amount of oil
that was spilled from one of these and we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that like Bokashi's have been used,
EM Bokashi's have been used like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Exxon Valdez or no, I think it was the
Costco Busan here in the Bay Area to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we figure out the amount of oil
that's regularly spilled and we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans make that much Bokashi,
you know, three times the amount of the
[SPEAKER_00]: average spill and have it on site,
then it provides retraining for the
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're getting great involvement with
the oil companies because wherever the
[SPEAKER_00]: rupture occurs, we go there and we will
train the veterans and have the veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: in that area make the Grokashi for the
next oil spill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the area that was ecologically
impacted, they're also going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: funding in the form of, you know,
those veterans in that area are hired and
[SPEAKER_00]: retrained to make the Bokashi for the next
oil spill cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was 10,000 barrels that they
spill, we're going to make 30,000 barrels
[SPEAKER_00]: of Bokashi in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're adding to the local economy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting training for those local vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a way with these corporate
sponsors, you know, I pray it goes through
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we hope it does, but it looks like
it is going to become a reality that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to open up shop wherever
these oil spills occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it feels very much like a kind of a
Johnny Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the environmental blight happens,
you're suddenly coming in and teaching the
[SPEAKER_01]: local vets how to make Grokashi,
which then fixes the environment and also
[SPEAKER_01]: creates new local business and retrains
the vet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it's a win, win,
win, win, like everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be too simple at it or stating
it, but it's like threatening them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time because it's the best public
relations that they could ask for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, I really appreciate you taking
the time to be on the show, Alan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even though we're reaching the
end of the show here, I can tell that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got stories for days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably could have had a show that's
three times as long, but thanks for taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of your busy schedule to share with us
your vision of probiotics and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: break it down at not only a scientific
level, but you really gave a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: history and romance of it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I read your posts all the
time, you gave me a new perspective of
[SPEAKER_01]: working with fermentation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you and sharing what you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored just to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my closest friends you've
interviewed and you've impressed me every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try to surround myself with
people that are so smart that they scare
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing with this show is I'm able
to surround myself with people that know
[SPEAKER_01]: more than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I'm, you know, I'm in media,
I'm able to reach out to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: folks like you who inspire me and happily
y'all are willing to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a benefit of what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
