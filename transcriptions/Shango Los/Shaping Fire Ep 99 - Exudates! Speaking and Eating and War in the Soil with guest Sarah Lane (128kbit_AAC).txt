[SPEAKER_02]: The community of cannabis cultivators has
always been tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: For most of our lives we were persecuted
and in some jurisdictions we still are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That persecution meant that we couldn't
access many of the botanists we'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that meant there were big parts of
cannabis cultivation that was kind of in a
[SPEAKER_02]: biological black box.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't see what was happening inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we knew was what we were doing and
then what was coming out the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now though, between the creeping partial
legalization we've got and the internet,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can now access the minds of scientists
who support our efforts to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: magnificent, thriving, and medicinal
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's one of those episodes where we get
to look inside that black box.
[SPEAKER_02]: During today's episode we will examine the
relationship between the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and the soil life and get a better
understanding of how they talk to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and how they work together for
mutual benefit in this intimate
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is plant biologist,
Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Lane is wrapping up her PhD in plant
and cellular biology at University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her work primarily focuses on root
exudates that are involved in iron uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: in plants and their potential medicinal
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah consults for licensed cannabis
cultivators in Canada and is an avid
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil cannabis home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to her university research needs,
she is also very experienced in fog ponics
[SPEAKER_02]: and hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah has a wicked large plant collection
and is currently designing a specialty
[SPEAKER_02]: terrarium for growing cloud orchids.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the first set of today's episode,
we will focus on what exudates are,
[SPEAKER_02]: their biological mechanics, and how they
interact with microbes and other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the second set, we will talk about
the relationship between exudates and
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal networks, signaling varieties of
exudates, and address the challenges of a
[SPEAKER_02]: 24-hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We finish up the third set discussing
exudates and salt-based fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates and soilless growing mediums like
coco coir, and the misconception of using
[SPEAKER_02]: unsulphured molasses to replace the
nutrition that exudates provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us and
sharing your expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that most people who
cultivate cannabis, who have even heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates, only really know that exudates
are something that the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: gives off and that the microbes eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the plant feeding the microbes,
and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we know that that's
actually overly simplistic and misses the
[SPEAKER_02]: big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we start by kind of getting
everybody on the same page, and if you
[SPEAKER_02]: would, explain what exudates are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exudates are basically all of the
different molecules and components that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant makes in the roots that are like
given off to the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bunch of stuff inside the
plant cells and inside the root that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then exudates are everything that the
plant makes specifically to transport out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of different types of
exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be specific types of secondary
metabolites, which are not used for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many, many different functions
of them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to give us an idea of like how
many different exudates there are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are we talking about like there's like
five buckets or 50 buckets or a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: buckets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how many varieties are there just in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh goodness, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There honestly are so many different types
of exudates, and we're just scratching the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of what exudates actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like off the top of my head, like
functionally, there's probably like 20
[SPEAKER_00]: different groups of exudates that I know
of personally, but I think exudates are
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely hard to study because they are
in the soil and the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll probably keep finding new
ones over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the idea now that this is kind of
like asking you how many types of bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just like a ton in nature,
and we're constantly finding more as our
[SPEAKER_02]: technology gets more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like to help illustrate what some of
these exudates are, can you give us like
[SPEAKER_02]: three different examples of exudates that
maybe you partake particularly like just
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can kind of wrap our head
around, you know, what they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, the ones that I work with
specifically are called phenylpropanoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually sort of a group of
molecules that come from the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: building up lignin, but they have lots of
different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those include things like some of the
more complicated ones are chlorogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, which is actually found really in
high amounts in coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people might be a little bit more
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also amino acids like that not
only are used for protein building,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plants can make special non-protein
amino acids that are really useful in
[SPEAKER_00]: finding out things like fishing out iron
out of the soil and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one is flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a bunch of different
types of flavonoids, which is a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge supergroup of different types of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're involved in everything from
antioxidant behavior to even signaling to
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've mentioned, I think I've pulled
out like three different categories from
[SPEAKER_02]: your examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be like the only ones I was
aware of, the nutrition, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've mentioned signaling a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sounds like there are some
that actually process like things like
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of like worker bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do all of exudates roughly fall into these
three categories or are there many more
[SPEAKER_02]: categories to like what they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think functionally, we can kind of bin
them if you want to call it that into a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely like interacting with
nutrients directly, which is kind of where
[SPEAKER_00]: my expertise is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's signaling back and forth,
like talking to bacteria or fungi or that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing where they interact with the
microbes and the microbes interact back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another big group that
are almost like anti-herbicidal or
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicidal, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones are responsible for sort of
clearing the way for the plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's more than that,
but I think that's kind of like the big,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I have an overly simplistic
understanding of the back and forth
[SPEAKER_02]: because the way I normally think about the
relationship with the plant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and the rest of the life in the
rhizosphere is that during the daytime,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant will be fed by the microbes and
the rest of the players in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during the dark period,
the plant will then turn around and send
[SPEAKER_02]: the required nutrition back into the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like a back and forth,
like a tide thing dependent on whether or
[SPEAKER_02]: not it is day or night cycle for the
plant, which is kind of quarterbacking
[SPEAKER_02]: this back and forth is how I generally
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that may very well be way too
simplistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you kind of explain how it goes
back and forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think like the basic idea of
signaling is a little bit like texting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much that the plants are
providing nutrition directly to the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: although in some cases, or from the roots
to the microbes, although in some cases it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always that the microbes are
providing nutrition back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of signaling that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like if you can
imagine, you know, being at home and hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you pick me up some milk from the
grocery store?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could also be like, hey,
I've got cookies when you've got home,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you come home and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I mean by
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that signaling happens all day,
every day at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some regulation with light
interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the light drives photosynthesis
and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the plant is on, it's often
needing a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: activities like nutrient acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's doing some, you know,
stress responses to help against pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this happens in the daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we know enough about whether
or not it happens in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the roots are always in the dark,
technically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the way that you described it,
this kind of like all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and and protozoa and then the
plant exudates all kind of calling out to
[SPEAKER_02]: each other and signaling, you know,
pick up milk or I have cookies when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like and if everybody is doing that,
I suddenly got this idea of like this
[SPEAKER_02]: cacophony of signals back and forth and
like shopkeepers calling out what's on
[SPEAKER_02]: sale and kind of like some kind of like
big Turkish bizarre and like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to, you know, get everybody's
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that is that a reasonable picture of
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful picture of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do think that's exactly what's
happening, because they're like we often
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it being just the plant and
the microbes interacting with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the microbes interact with each other,
too, and with bungee and with different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is just a huge web of different
organisms talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that is like, you know,
selling your chips on the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the hot dog stand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it is advertising for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very, very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I think we wish we
knew more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to dissect what each of those
components is contributing to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: life or even just how the plant is growing
in the soil is really complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's strange, too, because like I've
always kind of thought is of the soil as
[SPEAKER_02]: while a violent place often, you know,
pretty calm, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it's kind of serene in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's probably because of the level of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like I'm living on this human level of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I could see really closely under a
microscope, I'd be I'd be seeing all this
[SPEAKER_02]: activity in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's only quiet to me because like
I can't hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very barely controlled chaos down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we have any technology or any way to
gauge the amount of you know, rambunctious
[SPEAKER_02]: signaling that's going back and forth like
there is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any kind of like, you know,
anything that we can like put into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil to gauge signaling that's taking
place in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's it's pretty complicated,
but there's some interesting things that
[SPEAKER_00]: go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I guess it depends on what level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're talking about right now is
on the chemical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the the way that a lot of
people are doing this is either bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they take a big sample of soil and then
measure it for different different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of organisms or different types of signals
that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then trying to tease that out,
we can tell differences like maybe between
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of soil or different types
of communities, different types of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it'd be really hard to pick
out which one is responsible for exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: which one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the other option is to take an
individual plant and an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: organism and see what they do together,
just the two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the real challenges with
like soil ecology or or like ecology in
[SPEAKER_00]: general is just trying to pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either have to treat it as a whole and
just accept that you don't understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual relationships or you have to
get in there and try and tease them apart
[SPEAKER_00]: one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about a couple
of these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the one that we've talked about the
most so far is are the signaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we understand, you know,
what they're trying to signal like like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have this type of nutrition or or maybe I
need this type of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they doing that primarily chemically
or is an electrical charge or what is at
[SPEAKER_02]: that very small level?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the mode of communication?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it is chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for the most part, it is like
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to the exudate thing,
like these plants are making these very
[SPEAKER_00]: high highly specific molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically in some cases like an
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those are actually like taken up
by the microbe in question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changes what the microbe can
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually interacts after a long
signal in cascade inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll interact on the genome and then
they'll be able to produce different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of molecules based on that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that ends up getting made and
exuded out by the microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe that's an RSVP response
card back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they kind of do this back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes it might just be like they
actually make a different molecule and
[SPEAKER_00]: that molecule is then transported into the
plant cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super cool, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the idea that that the the the
signaling exudate kind of like combines
[SPEAKER_02]: with the microbe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And between the two of them, they develop
this superpower that's the only way that
[SPEAKER_02]: what is necessary is produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very complex complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also important to note,
though, that what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: there is like a pretty symbiotic
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is going to be some
opportunistic stuff, too, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants are making stuff that
maybe it has one purpose, but the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: can use it for something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it uses it for something different and
produces some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those different types of molecules
have, like, a happy accident to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: could use some of them to like sometimes
it is more like a a free bin than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's like really organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there can be both happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this idea of invitation microbes,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if they are all speaking to each
other through subtle chemicals for for
[SPEAKER_02]: those of us who are, you know,
we're adding things to our soil all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you know, this fertilizer or that
fertilizer or, you know, some kind of soil
[SPEAKER_02]: drench with like an FPJ in it or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: How easy is it for us to disrupt that
chemical signaling back and forth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like let's say that, you know,
I'm talking with a friend in my yard and a
[SPEAKER_02]: plane flies over, you know, relatively low
because I live near an airport and we just
[SPEAKER_02]: have to like stop talking for a minute and
wait for the plane to fly over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that that we could
potentially do as cultivators that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be so air quotes loud in the rhizosphere
that everybody have to talk, stop talking
[SPEAKER_02]: for a minute because we just dumped
something in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I think unless it's water,
like probably everything we add is
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting things a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit like getting a shipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody stops to bring in the
delivery kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is also true of microbes
because they're responding to the to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you've added as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I think all of them are going
to be disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more how long because,
like, for example, if you're just adding
[SPEAKER_00]: water or some nutrients, like depending on
how light or how much nutrients you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding, it might be like really short term
and they can use up those nutrients pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and then they're back to doing
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's more long term and you've
really altered the soil chemistry enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that like maybe something dies off or
those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are all things that could
really disrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think especially with nutrients,
because a lot of what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: is the plant signaling for nutrients or
something related to nutrition that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the things that would turn
off signals from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't need to get it from the
microbe if you're providing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that might be something
else that would really, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would definitely be a plain overhead
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take one more step along this
disruption idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically with with water, I mean,
clearly the soil requires water so that
[SPEAKER_02]: things can have mobility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes, you know, a cultivator will
just over water terribly and and it can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drown lots of varieties of
microbes or, you know, cause them to cyst
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on the on the variety,
can we drown exudates to to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: where, you know, we kind of like wipe out
a whole, I don't know, generation of them
[SPEAKER_02]: and and the the soil that needs to dry out
and then the plant needs to restart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think, yeah, like if you're if
you're like watering to run off and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, there's certainly stuff that's
leaching out of the soil and some things
[SPEAKER_00]: are kept more by the soil than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about these molecules,
a lot of them are charged and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: charged like the positively charged types
of molecules tend to stay in soil better
[SPEAKER_00]: than negatively charged ones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could definitely like flush a lot
of things out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the time scale for production
of exudates by the plant, it can replenish
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not on like the,
you know, days, weeks or months sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those cells are making a lot of stuff
really rapidly and some of the responses
[SPEAKER_00]: can happen within seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it'll be seconds to make the
exudates again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that they might need to make
more of them is a pretty quick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you might you might disrupt it
like really temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest danger with
overwatering is probably damage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots or like promoting the growth of
anaerobic bacteria or pathogenic species,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that was we were just talking about
the signaling variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's talk about the nutrition
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like some of the signaling
ones actually do end up playing a role in
[SPEAKER_02]: getting nutrition for the plant themselves
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between like that
kind of activity and the ones that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in the nutritive exudates bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those ones are more direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, everything is happening at
like a chemical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chemistry of the molecules can
interact with the chemistry of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just completely bypass the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, I work with iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is really hard to get out of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of like it's locked up like
a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants will actually make
molecules that can go and sort of fish it
[SPEAKER_00]: out from the rock and interact directly
with iron molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is brought over to the root
and it can be taken up that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with things like nitrogen and
phosphorus and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's certainly like either
they're making it a more favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment for the those ions to just
kind of like those molecules to just be
[SPEAKER_00]: available for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're actually able to like drag it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, those non-protein amino acids
that I was talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants like grasses will make those
and they actually just kind of pick up the
[SPEAKER_00]: iron like a little basket of eggs and
actually bring it inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can interact certainly with
molecules to signal back and forth to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them to make other things and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can actually just interact with
the nutrients directly as that molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: and bring it in as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when cultivators kind of like loosely
say, oh, this fertilizer is plant ready or
[SPEAKER_02]: that fertilizer needs to be processed in
the rhizosphere before the plant can take
[SPEAKER_02]: it, is it these exudates that we're
talking about that are doing that work of
[SPEAKER_02]: coming across nutrition or minerals or
whatever in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the exudates are what are breaking it
down and putting it into a form that can
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with the actual root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one group we haven't talked about
is low molecular weight organic acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are like really, really small,
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that I can think of off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like citric acids and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can make those and that will just
make it easier to take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of what you're talking about?
Yes.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, most of the time we
just talk about that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, casually using like contemporary
language and not the science specific
[SPEAKER_02]: language.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of like, you know, accidentally
come across it, it's kind of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, this is what we're talking
about all the time and we don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely like this big
component of like when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: especially about living soils and things
like that, there's everything at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day is a salt, even if it's from an
organic material or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being broken up into these little
tiny ions that we call salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's just a matter of whether
it needs help to get to that state or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we're providing it as that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime we're talking about these like
exudates helping, like they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to put it into that form so the
plant can take it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the third bucket we were talking
about were I don't know, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_02]: better term, I'll say allopathic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're they're kind of like,
like, I don't know, almost military there
[SPEAKER_02]: where they where they go and they are
hurting the plant enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like the general idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allelopathic chemicals are these sort
of natural herbicides that some and not
[SPEAKER_00]: all plants make them, but some plants make
these types of exudates that basically act
[SPEAKER_00]: as like a herbicide or fungicide or
something like that to clear the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's made by the root, the roots going
through the soil and like leaving this
[SPEAKER_00]: material behind that is really toxic to
some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kills off neighboring roots and
that kind of thing and lets it grow
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And invasive species are often really good
at making these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants that are here already don't
have any defense against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just kills them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I asked you that question in
kind of like a general way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we found cannabis plants making this
particular kind of war making exudate yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have do we have we seen that in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we're still just learning
what cannabis puts out, but have we found
[SPEAKER_02]: that yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty unique situations when this
is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, walnut trees,
black walnut trees, you cannot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anything under a black walnut tree for a
huge radius because that's how toxic it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis, you can plant quite a few
plants right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is, it would be on maybe like,
I don't know, maybe it would be antifungal
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it actually has anything
like this that would kill off plant roots
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great example, because that's
actually what I was thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about, oh, maybe maybe this
is why some of the companion planting that
[SPEAKER_02]: we put with cannabis is more successful
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the cannabis plant is actually
trying to choose its neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all these root things that we're
talking about, like it influences the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that environment is going to be
hospitable to some other plants and less
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitable to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not because it's directly killing
off the plants, but just because maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant doesn't enjoy those kind of
conditions the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about the signaling kind,
and we talked about the allopathic kind,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we talked about the processing that
are going to go and free up nutrition in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the last category that we
haven't covered are the exudates that are
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little bit about the exudates
that the plant puts off that is nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are kind of complicated,
because I guess it depends on what is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of things that are carbon-based,
because carbon is basically what we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, like sugars and things like that,
are what end up being used to make energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of different types
of root exudates could be nutritious to
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms, provided they can break
them down and use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of the metabolites I work
with we think might be getting eaten up by
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, which are the acids and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has a sugar attached,
because a lot of these molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of these different types of
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have an acid that's attached to
a sugar, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those would be possible nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you brought up carbon, I want to ask
you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where this might take us,
is what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night I was talking to soil biologist
Leighton Morrison on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: About how excited I was about our
interview today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, exudates are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like liquid carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure what he meant,
but I figured I would ask you about him
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, are exudates like liquid carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge number of atoms out there
and elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that are most common in
organic chemistry and life are carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of these tiny, it's just those
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously there's other things like
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants need manganese and magnesium
and all these other different metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these molecules that we're
talking about today are based off of those
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking liquid carbon,
a lot of these molecules have a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're mostly carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as something can break the
carbon apart and use it in their biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk a little bit about the
nature of the signaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to know whether it's more push
or pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the signaling happens, and perhaps
it's both, is it more like putting out a
[SPEAKER_02]: sign that says, I have cookies for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want cookies, come over to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more like placing an order where
one side of it, either the microbe or the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, will put out a request to the other
side for what they specifically need?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's sort of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really depends on which specific
interaction you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of like to think of it more
like a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some asking questions
and like, I need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also going to be like,
I'll give you this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also happens over multiple cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just like a one message in one
message back sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these cycles can have multiple
signals back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where in the plant are the exudates
made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they made like in one particular
exudate factory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it like made all over the plant in
many places?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to be honest, I think it's
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our general understanding of
where exudates are produced is usually the
[SPEAKER_00]: root tip, because that's the growing part
of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one that kind of has to be
the most responsive to the different
[SPEAKER_00]: things it's encountering as it's moving
through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like where on the root,
it's going to be on the surface cells
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly, because they're the ones that are
directly next to the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of different types of
molecules and signals to make those
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules can come from all over the plant
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like different parts of the root can ask
for different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different parts of the shoot, like the
growing part of the plant that we see all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, that can also trigger different
things to be made as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think like the cells right on the
outside of the root are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different too, because above that
growing zone, there might be there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates being produced, but they might be
different because there's different needs
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the different needs and all the
cacophony and how small this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that there are so many
exudates next to each other, next to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other, next to each other that they're
nearly tripping over each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so much activity
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit of a soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are the exudates stuck where they are,
and they're only mobile if there is water
[SPEAKER_02]: around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do they have some kind of solution for
mobility for themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of depends on the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, they're going to be mostly
right next to the root, and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to kind of diffuse to places
where there's less of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as like if you were to dump a bunch
of salt into the glass, eventually the
[SPEAKER_00]: salt would all dissolve into the water,
but they would be most concentrated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom unless you stirred it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like that if you imagine
the bottom of the glass is like the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being made right at the bottom
there, and then kind of diffuses up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and eventually it'll get pretty far away,
but not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it depends on the type of
molecule, because they're mostly water
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble, but there can be some that are
kind of more lipophilic or like oil
[SPEAKER_00]: loving, that might move differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be more likely to stay next to
the cell that's more like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe don't travel as far away from
the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doubly makes sense, because the
theme of all of your answers have been,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's complex and it depends on which one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm starting to realize that most of
the generalizations that we might make
[SPEAKER_02]: about exudates really don't apply to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's hard to make generalizations
about exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess we'll kind of like wrap up this
first set with what is it about exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: that make them be exudates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they all act in different ways
and move in different ways and signal in
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways and do different things,
there's gotta be something that they all
[SPEAKER_02]: have in common that makes them exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's just location, I think is
like the biggest thing that connects all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you say, we have, there's lots
of different functions for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lots of different jobs and
interact with different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're all outside the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all made by the plant specifically
for being out in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing that ends up
connecting all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the exudates are created outside of the
root or it's made in the root and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's shoved out of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made in the root and shoved out like
I was saying earlier, like those cells
[SPEAKER_00]: that are right on the surface of the root,
they're making them inside and then
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging them and then sending them out
into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of reminds me of the endophytic
bacteria that we talked about a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: shows back about, you know, the thing that
makes it a bacteria endophytic is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: spends some amount of its life inside of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it goes, you know, it'll go in and
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so perhaps exudates are, you know,
things that start in the roots and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they are pushed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as good a definition as any.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is plant biologist Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Online cannabis seed distributors often
seem to be all the same, but Multiverse
[SPEAKER_02]: Beans constantly works to provide you with
cannabis seeds and a buying experience
[SPEAKER_02]: that you won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiverse Beans works directly with the
breeders to secure as many packs of your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites as possible so that they have
your favorite beans long after others have
[SPEAKER_02]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shops simply buy breeder minimums,
but I get messages all the time from
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders saying some version of Multiverse
asked to buy my entire run.
[SPEAKER_02]: At multiversebeans.com, you can find rare
cannabis seeds from night owl seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: including the dark owl sub-label,
Mephisto Genetics, Square One Genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: Robin Hood Seeds, and Ethos and so many
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiverse also initiates projects with
breeders to secure exclusive packs that
[SPEAKER_02]: you simply won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiverse founder Paul Lahl sees himself
not only as a curator of the best cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds available, but also as a
collaborator with breeders trying to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: novel crosses to the market that his

[SPEAKER_02]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_02]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_02]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_02]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_02]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_02]: in tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_02]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use
and pit moss is inert so it won't change
[SPEAKER_02]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens and small
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.

[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is plant biologist Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about exudate mechanics and what they are
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can get an idea of,
get our heads wrapped around this
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting chemical that's in the
rhizosphere and what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so during this set, we're gonna focus
more on what they actually do and how
[SPEAKER_02]: this, I don't know, cacophony or symphony
takes place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how specific are the signals for either
nutrition or the signals telling exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: to go out and mine some manganese or
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there specific exudates for all of
these processes or is it like when you
[SPEAKER_02]: tell somebody, hey, would you pick up
bread, but I don't tell them what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get an idea of how specific
the requests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, another theme of the day, it's
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in some cases, it's extremely
specific, especially when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about symbol, like symbiotic relationships
like rhizobium or in legumes or
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like very specific to the point where
it's species specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a specific molecule that has one job
and that is to go and signal to
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae fungal interactions and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be that specific, but there's
also some that have sort of more of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad, like it has multiple different
types of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be maybe a more complicated
molecule where one end does one thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other end does another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the plant can make multiple
things to do the same job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the tasks that the exudates do,
especially the ones that are sent out for
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and probably similarly the ones
that are sent out for like inert things
[SPEAKER_02]: like manganese or iron or whatever,
those jobs sound familiar or similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: the role of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we often talk on this show about how
the fungal networks are like super
[SPEAKER_02]: highways that will go out and source these
different nutrition that are needed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and then kind of bring them back and
there's this relationship there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that since this task is very
similar to the exudates or at least how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're described, there's probably a lot
of exudate interaction with the fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's two components.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the exudates can do a similar job,
but on a much more tiny scale because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't travel very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they need to go farther out for
the nutrients, then the exudates would
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with the mycorrhizae directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is basically initiating
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds weird to say infection when I
don't mean pathogenic, but essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has to invite the mycorrhizae,
especially endo mycorrhizae, to infect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very specific signal that's
sent out to interact with that fungus to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow it to come and join the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be in a situation where the
plant would need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if the plant is deficient in
phosphorus, for example, it might interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with mycorrhizae more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if it's not that deficient or if
there's plenty of phosphorus next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: root, maybe it interacts with that less
and the exudates that it makes for itself
[SPEAKER_00]: will do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to overtax the exudate
system?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the plant is making these exudates
and everything that the plant does takes
[SPEAKER_02]: some amount of, I don't know, energy or
life force or effort, depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: level we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the exudates are so busy, can the
exudates be working so hard that it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant less thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if the plant is unhealthy,
that might be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often talk about things like a carbon
budget, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a certain amount of carbon that
a given amount of plant can fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a given amount of nutrients it
can take up just based on its biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so carbon budgeting, that means that
different parts of the plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: allocating carbon to different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, for example, it's suffering a
massive Thrip wave, it will be busy making
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon containing compounds to deal with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might make less exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's perfectly healthy,
all things considered, it will make what
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll make the amount that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was going to ask was that,
are there things that we can do that would
[SPEAKER_02]: stress the exudate process and signaling
exchange?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you threw the Thrip thing on the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps the answer to the question that
I was going to ask is like anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: stresses the plant is going to call on the
exudate to have to do more work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't stress your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, yeah, or it's going to divert
the resources of the plant elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like there's a certain amount,
we call it basal or base, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of like maintenance level
things that the plant makes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will respond to different stresses
by taking as much carbon and nutrients as
[SPEAKER_00]: it can to whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's, if it's happy and healthy,
then it can like pump up those base levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really under stress somewhere
else, it might take what it would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: make in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take some carbon from that and
send it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might mean that you have there's
still probably going to be some exudates
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll probably mean that there's less
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for somebody who's listening to
what you're saying, like me, and my brain
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to, you know, what can I do to not
stress out the exudate creation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, that's a that's nice that I'm
thinking about that level of my plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, that's, that's not really
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really should go up a level of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and think about not doing things that
stress out the plant, and then just let
[SPEAKER_02]: the exudates manage themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, yeah, like I think if you
take care of your soil, and you take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of your your plant, and they're both in
good shape, then you shouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I mean, making sure that your soil
is healthy is definitely a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making sure the plant isn't,
you know, being as I said, mauled by
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips or something like that is also
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody wants that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those kind of things, making sure it's
getting enough water, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all those all those things that
we generally try and make sure our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have anyway, if your plant is healthy,
there's not really anything extra that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we we think compost teas are
one thing that you can do to kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil life and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might help with the exudate
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, it's really out of
your control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's kind of nice to have something
that, you know, we're learning about this
[SPEAKER_02]: process, but it isn't another thing that
we have to, like, technically worry about,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do your if you do your regular,
your regular living soil kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: like like this will take care of itself,
which is great, because we already have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll talk more about compost tea a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to wade into a a pretty fierce
debate in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I'm a pretty heavy participant in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been looking for someone like
you to weigh in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I'm going to pull you into this
debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is on 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the debate is generally about does
the 24 hour light cycle is it best for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it starve the the soil from
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea kind of goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some growers like to use 24 hours light
because it causes the plant to grow more
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can either grow a bigger,
higher yielding plant during that time or
[SPEAKER_02]: during, you know, its regular life cycle
because because it's just getting more
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can actually shorten the cycle by
using more light, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: allows you to perhaps get in another
growing cycle over the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people use 24 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the flip of it, which happens to be
where I stand, is that no, 24 hours of of
[SPEAKER_02]: light indoors is not going to create the
best plant because while it makes it grow
[SPEAKER_02]: faster, you're not allowing the back and
forth of the the the light phase and the
[SPEAKER_02]: dark phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both both phases are necessary so that the
the the exudates and the signaling and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the processes that happen when the plant
is awake with the light, it needs to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some dark time so the contrasting
signaling and exudates can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all varieties of exudate signaling can
happen and all of the varieties of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and those things can go back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a feeling that the answer is
probably somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But specifically to this 24 hours of light
question, how does 24 hours of light
[SPEAKER_02]: impact this relationship between the plant
and the rhizosphere as far as the exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: playing a role?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a spicy debate, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, again, to the theme of the day,
it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not ever seen anybody be able to
because of the complexity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere and all the stuff that's going
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anybody actually be able to
put this into a scientific study where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to say definitively if you give
a plant 24 hours of light, the exudates
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really in the middle, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple different things that I
can think of off the top of my head if if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's OK if I ramble for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light cycles, light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think lots of things are turned on by
the plant rather than off when light is
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because light is driving water
transport and nutrient uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's also driving photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that too much dark is as bad as
too much light is, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're seeing the growth and the
yield increase because the plant is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of stuff during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a circadian clock in plants
where there are different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the daytime and in the
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually are different for the
root part and the shoot part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually operate on different
clocks, but they do talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm going with this is is
that there is a circadian rhythm,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't know enough about it to be
able to say that that having light on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant is going to affect the
roots in the way that I think this debate
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we think about it, the roots
are always in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never in the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like there might be a small
amount of light that makes it to the to
[SPEAKER_00]: the root, but not enough that it should
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can still sense it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a very deep topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe I'm thinking too top down
about this, because even though the light
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't specifically reach the roots,
during the light mode, I think of it as
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant is giving commands through the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though the roots aren't lit
up, the roots are responding to needs and
[SPEAKER_02]: commands from a plant that is actively
photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then then in the dark cycle,
those those commands and needs of the
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis are no longer taking place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I imagine that the roles and the
tasks of the root zone change when the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is is is changing modes from
photosynthesizing to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the processing of nutrients that it does
during the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's and I think the key word
there is change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they take up a bunch of
nutrients during the the daytime,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a lot of those exudates that are
helping with nutrient acquisition should
[SPEAKER_00]: be active, like they're they're actively
like, you know, fishing out the different
[SPEAKER_00]: components that it needs and putting it
into the plant so the plant can continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would change if the light is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do have like, we even know from
like, but you know, those green potatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: like root themselves can sense light,
both outside like sources of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the inside sources that we were
just talking about, like the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the light that the plant above is
sensing is also like notify, they notify
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots that they need stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is I think this next question
is is is the is the seal the deal question
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've been looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so if the if the root zone is doing
different tasks, when the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing light, because the plant is
asking for things involved with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, photosynthesis production during
the day, those types of tasks,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then and then when the light is gone,
the root zone changes to different sets of
[SPEAKER_02]: tasks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would seem to suggest to me that it
needs a dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those dark period tasks can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, maybe I'm right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the wrong reason, for the for
reason I didn't realize, I thought that
[SPEAKER_02]: during the dark, the exudates would stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's not it, because exudates
happen around the clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's that the exudate and signaling
that happens when the plant above is
[SPEAKER_02]: experiencing dark, those differentiated
tasks need to have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to to have a thriving plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that could be a reasonable
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's also two things,
I guess, there is dark reactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like evening onset types of
things that change in the plant that are
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to a lessening of light,
at least when we're not talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, growing light, when we have actually
like changes in light over the daytime as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your plant on the balcony or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also light independent
reactions that tend to happen kind of at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is like
photosynthesis is light driven,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you absolutely have to have light for
that whole series of of chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the like, other types of reactions
don't need light like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be happening 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really think for my own personal
opinion, definitely an opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that a little bit of darkness helps
because one thing that light is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a stressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates all these like, fast happening
reactions it's quite powerful,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can make really reactive molecules that
if they're present in too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can damage the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think having 24 hours of light
constantly would, yeah, maybe mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the downtime that you need
to take care of any kind of damage that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from light and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for I guess, my my weigh in on this
would be like a little bit of dark is
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm grateful to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this idea that there can be too much
light is interesting because most of us,
[SPEAKER_02]: or folks who grow indoors anyway,
while I've been historically an outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, I've been dabbling in indoor just
to learn new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, cultivators are
looking to blast the plants with as much
[SPEAKER_02]: light as is possible without bleaching or
burning the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm hearing from you is that
there really is a top end of how much
[SPEAKER_02]: light we necessarily want to give the
plant because there is too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a top level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think especially with like, I have most
of my experiences is growing inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's different things to
think about because you can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: have too much light inside, but it's not
like an overall amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these focal lengths that come
with bulbs and it kind of it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: shining a laser, you know, the magnifying
glass on the, you know, something
[SPEAKER_00]: flammable and the sun kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it focuses all the light from the
bulb to a single point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing in that point,
it's really strong, but like just for that
[SPEAKER_00]: little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's too much light, but there's so
much sun out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any indoor bulb at this
point has ever gotten to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: it can compete with the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too dim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectrum isn't strong enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the damaging wavelengths that
we think of with light like UV B or C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are just not present in the same quantity,
unless it's like, you know, a UVC light or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much point light and then
there's too much general light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was making an overgeneralization
about the too much light as if it was all
[SPEAKER_02]: sunlight, but that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all, you know, no matter what kind of
bulb we are talking about, it is some
[SPEAKER_02]: degree less than sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's probably those, that gap
between sunshine and whatever the
[SPEAKER_02]: personality of the bulb is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably where the hitch and the
giddy up is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is somewhere in what the bulb is lacking
when compared to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in indoors, like most of the
light stress that I've seen is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn the lights on right after you
spray something on the plants and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: some like lens burning where the lights
just kind of magnified and focused at a
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get like little point burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, you can definitely see a lot more
types of light damage and stress because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so bright out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's hot too, like the plant just
has a really hard time managing that level
[SPEAKER_00]: of light in that those poor little photo
systems get a little stressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talked on the phone the other day,
kind of preparing for this discussion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you used a term that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's a scientific term
or if it's just something that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: using to describe to me, because you use
such fantastic examples, but you use this
[SPEAKER_02]: phrase, free living micro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and I remember talking to you,
I remember like, oh, wow, I never,
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really thought about microbes that
were in the soil, but weren't really
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you just talk about free living
microbes for a moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially when we think about ecology
and like what's happening in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil, there's, we definitely talk a
lot about microbes that interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but there's a couple of different
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's symbiosis where they need each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's kind of like
opportunistic sort of interactions where
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talk about free living microbes,
we generally use that term to mean things
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of, that are just, they're in
the soil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be next to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, like if you remove the plant,
they go on living, they, they do their
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and, and they, they, it's not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything, like maybe the plant
needs them more than they need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're free living, they,
they can completely complete their entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle without a plant, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that also brings up an interesting
question about the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you said, oh, there are some of
these microbes that, that wouldn't exist
[SPEAKER_02]: without the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is, is this one of the reasons why it is,
it is so helpful to the cannabis plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: have other companion plants around because
these, these other plants are,
[SPEAKER_02]: are helping support these, these free
living microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just makes the entire rhizosphere
more complex and more thriving and more
[SPEAKER_02]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like cover plants, for example,
essentially what they're trying to do is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is improve the soil life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens either through like
providing a matrix, like all those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: provide basically housing in a lot of
ways, like a little scaffold for different
[SPEAKER_00]: things to live on and in and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under, but it also might help with,
for example, maintaining humidity longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if there's microbes in the soil
that prefer to be wet all the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't like drying out, then you might
have that layer is, is happier because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a plant, they're keeping the
moisture locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't like a lot of light and
they're kind of shading the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the fungus can get a little bit
more close to the surface or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I'm sure there's dozens of
different things that a companion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also plant, like I personally
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover because it tends to also,
it has an interesting relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that actually lets it take on and
fix more nitrogen than a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also brings the benefit of having
that nitrogen fixing relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: these bacteria that also benefit plants
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the cannabis plant itself doesn't
do this, but the fact that there's a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: near it that does improves the nutrient
nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite reasons, and the,
and the first reason I started companion
[SPEAKER_02]: planting for my cannabis is I had it
earlier in, in my cultivation history,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a tendency to water incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing too much, not often enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I needed to water less more often,
but less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a tendency to get a hydrophobic
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for folks who aren't familiar
with that, that means that the top of your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil container gets kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go and you, you hand
water, the water just kind of slides off
[SPEAKER_02]: and goes down the side instead of actually
soaking into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this happened to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I eventually learned during the
shaping fire water and watering episode
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you use a, a, a companion plant
or, or in this case, what we consider a
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop with that has lots of roots,
say for example, a clover or, or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some types of grasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They not only can provide like the,
the, the, the canopy, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: to create this little moisture vapor area
between the tops of its leaves and the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil just generally stays more
moist, but also I was going for the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that all of these roots that go down in
the soil, all are providing like small
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels for the water to actually go into
the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I actually, I actually
solved my poor watering just by adding a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a, a multiple root plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that, that problem just went
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, and, and the other wonderful thing
that you're doing is you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing different types of exudates,
which improves your, your soil life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you're just getting, it's just
more all the way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so are there, are we aware of any,
you know, either, either companion plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we use these, we use the idea of
companion plants to often be the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: like a bigger plant that's we're planting
nearby, like a, you know, like a,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a cabbage or potatoes underneath it
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then we kind of use the term
cover crop, even though we, most of us in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis use that term, not how it's
traditionally used to talk about lower
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that there's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of backing into this question but
what I want to ask you is are there plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that you are aware of that share exudate
flavors, complimentary exudate flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis plants that we should grow
about, around our cannabis plants simply
[SPEAKER_02]: because they increase the vibrancy of the
kinds of nutrition our cannabis plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want, thus suggesting,
oh, you should grow these plants because
[SPEAKER_02]: it too will attract the kinds of nutrition
and, and make it more buffet style for
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I think that the, the honest answer
to that one is I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near that level of detail in the
exudate scientific realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even just to identify exudates is
super challenging because you can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't even grow them in soil to be
able to collect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of my experiments, for example,
are done in a fogponic setup that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I can actually access the roots
without the soil becoming because of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, otherwise you capture all the
exudates from all the bacteria too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that we could get that,
that specific, but I do know that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing a lot of interesting research
with, with crops and companion plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the running theme there is usually
something that fixes nitrogen really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: because it brings in not only the,
the nitrogen fixing aspect, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the limiting factor in plant
growth, but it also brings all of its,
[SPEAKER_00]: its symbiotic bacteria with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think as long as you, as long as you
have a cover crop as, as we were just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, that's improving your soil
texture or soil health in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, like the, the anecdotal
answer would be something like we plant
[SPEAKER_00]: clover partly for the nitrogen fixing,
but we also plant things like basil or
[SPEAKER_00]: marigolds that can act like trap plants to
kind of give us a sense of, of whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not we have pest things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of thing, or anything that
helps like pollinators come in and that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that usually, I don't know,
more life is better usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I follow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this, the, the example that you
gave, I had not really considered how
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult your research must be because I
figured there was just some way for you
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, grab the exudates,
you know, scrape them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrape, pull up a plant and scrape some
off the roots, you know, that were in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all, everybody else who's in there
too, especially the bacteria, they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: laying out exudates too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just like a mess and you can't
tease them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're using this fog panic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, so the roots are just dangling and
there's not soil life interacting with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in an odd way, you're, you're like an
exudate rancher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got to, you've got to,
you've got to do this fog panic so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can collect them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple other ways, but they're
all like really, they're all complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do sterile culture, like tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the necessity of that is you have
to have a plant that you can grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I was working with, with cannabis,
I think it would be easier because it does
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in tissue culture, which would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just sample the media
and, and extract them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exudates from the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's lots and lots of plants out
there that don't like tissue culture that
[SPEAKER_00]: won't grow in a little tiny box or,
or trees, some of which I'm working with
[SPEAKER_00]: right now that, that just defy,
defy hydroponics in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you've got to get clever about it
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very much like ranching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the third set, stick with us
because we're going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: salt based nutrients and exudates,
hydroponics and exudates and unsulfured
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses and exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come on back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaving Fire and my
guest today is plant biologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plant industry.

[SPEAKER_02]: Josh Rutherford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los, and my guest today
[SPEAKER_02]: is plant biologist Sarah Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about a couple of the
applications of exudates with common
[SPEAKER_02]: situations that we deal with as cannabis
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one I want to talk about
with you, Sarah, is salt-based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, on this show, we generally,
not generally, we very specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: support living soil, you know,
a biomimicry of, you know, the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: world, and are not big fans of salt-based
nutrients generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I always know I need to
give them a fair shake when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: science, because that's really what we're
listening to, is the science, not my own
[SPEAKER_02]: biases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to know what kind of a
relationship that using, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled salt-based nutrients has on the
exudates and their ability to communicate
[SPEAKER_02]: in the community, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, I think most of the time
when we're talking salt-based nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it doesn't really go very well in
living soil, which is my preferred method
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on the same page there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: With salt-based nutrients, there's sort of
two things that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, like we were talking about
earlier, it can really disrupt the
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least that's my theory, because
you're introducing a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to the plant that it would have
been making all these wonderful little
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates to try and tease out from,
as we were saying earlier, microbes or the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil itself, and you're just flooding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it would pretty
significantly disrupt the exudate type,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, of what's being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing it does is it really kind
of messes around with the chemistry of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you're only feeding salt-based
nutrients, you end up with salt buildup
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can happen in a living soil
system, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually those conditions aren't really
conducive to microbial life or root
[SPEAKER_00]: health, and you end up just getting a lot
of compounding problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's less about the salt-based
nutrients somehow masking the chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: signatures or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that the people who are normally
giving off the exudates and receiving the
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates, they're generally just not
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant, if it's got all the
nutrients it needs, it's going to put its
[SPEAKER_00]: resources elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you're compromising the
soil life at all, then a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling would be, as we were saying
earlier, probably dampened, would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dampened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good word.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are playing with soil-less
mediums that are increasingly more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more cocoa-based, cocoa coir, to the point
that some folks are just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have soil in their substrate,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really hydroponic, but it's just,
it's cocoa and it's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious if these types of cocoa
and soil-less mediums have any impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: the signaling capacity of these exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I'm asking is, is the soil
component key to the ability of the
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates to be able to do their job?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just thinking about that because
of what your previous question was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the real problem I have with
salt-based nutrients is if it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination with living soil, because
there in living soil, you're relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: this microbial life to help provide
nutrients and it just gets all out of
[SPEAKER_00]: whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, for example, in my research,
I have to use salt-based nutrients because
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a very defined set of nutrients to
be able to repeat my experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, with the fogponics and
that kind of thing, it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: like the exudates are going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the types of exudates that
I'm looking at are nutrient-based and not
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, I think in cocoa or peat
or something like that, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not relying on the bacteria or fungus that
are present, to assist you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, it wouldn't make as much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would change the expression of
the exudates though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the types of exudates that are
produced would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're still going to be producing
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really interesting for you as a
living soil cultivator at home,
[SPEAKER_02]: but needing to use salts in the lab,
it puts you in a unique position to be
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing and contrasting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about like if you're using salt
fertilizers in a soil-less medium like
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa, and you just said that if you were
in that kind of environment, it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: that the exudates wouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be that there would be
nutrition-based exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would just be changing the variety of
exudates that are there that are being
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question would be would that impact how
the plant expresses itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to me that if we are changing
the exudates that are part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cacophony in the soil, that we're going to
get different colors on the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: different terpene profile, maybe a
difference in quality of thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the plant would express
itself at the top level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any weight to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we were to go back to our
bizarre metaphor from earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you feed salt-based nutrients,
it's kind of like putting in a really big
[SPEAKER_00]: box store or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really changes the flavor of what's
happening in that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that changes the personality
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like to borrow, I don't know
personifying my soil now, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the conversations that are happening
and the types of players that are there
[SPEAKER_00]: changes pretty significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't doubt that that would also
change the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant itself, the plant is very
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to do its best to grow and to
thrive in whatever circumstances that you
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you change those circumstances,
it's going to change itself to fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know lots of people that anecdotally
say that terpenes are different and like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles are different when
you grow in living soil and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like when you're feeding
salt-based, maybe you're going for weight
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant is forced into putting more
weight on because it's got all these extra
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that for sure because I
haven't studied it myself, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that anecdotally I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though you haven't seen the
science for it, it makes intuitive sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one of the reasons I like living
soil is because it sort of gives the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: its own options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a fun way to think about
ecology too in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant is really able to pick and
choose a little better than kind of forced
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding it salt, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk a lot on shaping fire about
the importance of a complex and thriving
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere to have a complex and thriving
plant so that you have a complex and
[SPEAKER_02]: delightful terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more you're simplifying what is in
the pot, say for example, using a cocoa
[SPEAKER_02]: soilless medium and salt-based nutrients,
I think the example you used was just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting them in a big box store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna get big box terps out of
it and not necessarily a full range
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's totally reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this also ties into carbon
budget because when you're forcing a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in a specific way, you're also
asking it to allocate all its resources in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction too, which generally means
it has less for other stuff, which maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: is stuff that we want like terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about I think I
can probably group hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_02]: fogponics together, but if not,
tease them back apart for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious because we've talked
significantly on this show about the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: food web and then somewhat about the water
food web and a hydroponics solution and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming a fog solution, we're talking
about the water food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering if the quality and
number and variety of the exudates that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in those systems sound like there's
going to be less since you initiated this
[SPEAKER_02]: by saying, oh, I use a fogponics because
we're trying to ranch these particular
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates and in soil there's just too
many.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming that in hydroponics and in
fogponics that there are going to be less
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates based on what you had said
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with hydroponics, with this same
idea crossover from the soil-less mediums
[SPEAKER_02]: that there may be reasons you want to use
hydroponics, but in the end, there are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be less varieties of exudates and
signaling conversation going on and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would run into the same problem
with hydroponics systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're not aggressively
supplementing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, the difference between
fogponics and hydroponics just quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: would be just like the dryness,
if that makes sense, because the fogponics
[SPEAKER_00]: is even though it's nutrients,
it's very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the roots aren't sitting in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not they're not like soggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that's really intolerant of
flooding, I've been able to grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully in fogponics, as opposed to
hydroponics where a lot of hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are really sitting in water or
constantly sprayed by water or a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a really subtle difference,
I think, because the nutrient solution I
[SPEAKER_00]: use for both is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as like, it compares pretty well
to soil-less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest difference,
at least for me, wouldn't necessarily be
[SPEAKER_00]: in exudates, it would be more in like root
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants in like peat or cocoa,
it's more like soil for like how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the exudate level, I think that the
same is probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a more defined set of
exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably coming mostly from the
plant and you miss out on some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with bacteria and fungus and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still maybe some that can grow
in those kind of conditions, but a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less than would be growing in soil,
at least as far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to add a little something for
all my hydroponics people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: listening who are now pissed at me because
I'm underselling their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be clear that I do understand
that some hydroponics, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a really great soil food web show a
couple years ago with Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, he is heavy into bringing in
water with mulm and fish poop in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of complexity there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was describing the great flowers
that he pulls from his setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also has some soil in the mix,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like flooding and draining the
soil and he's got the fish poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's making this like incredibly
biologically active environment that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers with terpene profiles that he says
we don't even get in a straight soil
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be clear, when I'm talking
about the limitations of hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the kinds of stuff that
people are generally either doing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: extra room in their house or at wild scale
of corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely appreciate the fact that
there are really tasty ways to do complex
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to add there that each of
these growing methods has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant will grow regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know I've had some really good
hydroponic weed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I've had some really good
living soil weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they all have their way of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that there's ways to make
hydroponics more accessible to bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you were just saying with a
different terpene profile that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get with either of the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just kind of goes to prove the
point that what you're putting on your
[SPEAKER_00]: roots does change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with the type of life that you're
growing changes what the plant is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's for the better,
depending on which method you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely like whatever you're growing
your plant in is better than not growing
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the challenges that we
ran into during these 24 hours of lights
[SPEAKER_02]: debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, I grew a huge ass plant
that was absolutely beautiful and totally
[SPEAKER_02]: got me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all my friends bought it from me and
that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all like, why are you telling
me that I shouldn't be using 24 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my response is always, it's not that
I'm saying that you can't grow plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: that your plants are going to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, you go 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that you're probably leaving
some quality on the table by doing it 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your terpene profile could be better
and the plants could be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could be more pest resistant if
you just gave it four hours of sleep or
[SPEAKER_02]: six hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But internet debates are rarely that
nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that even it doesn't really
at the end of the day matter if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a plant that suits your tastes,
however you're doing it is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unless you're dumping illegal
pesticides on it or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at the end of the day,
everybody's going to have a way of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's absolutely these debates are
all trying to tease out the finer ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and the best way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be very much personal
preference at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally prefer the taste of
living soil weed, but I've had really good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that's been grown in every other
condition you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, you know, yeah, as long as you're
growing a plant, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also gets me when when people are
demanding that, you know, their their
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe of how they grow is is the best and
one and only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that's that that shouldn't
even be coming out of out of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator's mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really depends on what your
particular needs are and your resources
[SPEAKER_02]: and your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I would I would love to
grow differently than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also don't live in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, totally fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which which which pushes me towards things
like short flowering thing and auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I lived in California,
I would probably still be focusing on my
[SPEAKER_02]: own cultivation on photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing I want to talk about is
is unsulfured molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is it is a pretty common in in
living soil for for folks to think that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can make up for not giving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll call it like whole nutrition,
like whole amendments, like let's say like
[SPEAKER_02]: like like fish meal and and crab shell and
maybe alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: All all of these amendments that we love
to use in living soil to have an abundant
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of nutrients there for the the I
guess the exudate processors to chew
[SPEAKER_02]: through and then give to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and and so the exudates come back and
then they feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is beautiful relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is not uncommon for people to say,
well, you know, I don't I don't need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that to take care of my microbes
because I just I just feed the microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: with unsulfured molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, that that pains me
because I have a gut feeling that just
[SPEAKER_02]: pouring sugar into the soil is not a great
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and molasses is kind of
unidimensional, whereas microbe life is so
[SPEAKER_02]: so vastly complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we are brewing a compost tea,
we will often add a bit of unsulfured
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses to that so that the the microbes
have have something to eat so that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: incubate them and have a whole bunch of
them in a small place that we can then
[SPEAKER_02]: pour onto our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I get where they got the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that is a misapplication of
the understanding of what effect molasses
[SPEAKER_02]: has on the microbe life in the rhizocere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as somebody who who has an intimate
relationship with exudates, what are your
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts on an adding unsulfured molasses
directly into the substrate as part of
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of nutritive root drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to go back to the theme of the
day, which is it's complicated and it
[SPEAKER_00]: depends, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if you are trying to recover
your soil life just with molasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really depends on the health of
the soil that you're adding it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that molasses just like it does in
compost tea is does have sugar in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure things will like to eat what's
there and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means that anything in your soil
you're adding it to is going to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got some nasty, you know,
anaerobic bacteria in in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: already, like that's going to love it as
much as the next thing does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is like a lot of the
amendments we add provide different,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, different opportunities for
different types of microbes to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're only feeding molasses and
that's how you're getting your microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: life, like it might get there eventually,
but it's also going to be the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that specifically like molasses and you'll
miss out maybe on some of the kelp or the
[SPEAKER_00]: crab meal type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is all kind of conjecture
because truthfully, the science isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be able to specifically identify
each different bacteria that come with
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what my gut feeling would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your health of your soil is really good
and you're already adding compost teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, if you're diluting a
little bit of molasses in water,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't think it's it's harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, like I do think that the
biggest factor on whether that's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea or bad is probably the health of your
soil to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, is there anything that we
can do to encourage healthy exudate
[SPEAKER_02]: creation by the cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've talked we've talked a bit
about like just generally keep your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there anything that we can do like
a is there is there any kind of a a a
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented plant juice or a supplement or
or in anything that we could do to
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage exudate creation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they really do seem to be a a
baseline to a thriving plant where if if
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got poor exudate activity,
everything that happens more complex than
[SPEAKER_02]: that is going to be limited by the the sad
exudate system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there anything that we can do that's
pro exudate that we should consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the best answer is
probably no and yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there isn't a magical thing that as
much as it would be nice to just like
[SPEAKER_00]: promote root health and the healthiest
roots you've ever seen just like sprout
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the out of the soil and you're good
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, it actually ends up being
about root health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the yes part comes in,
because you can support root health by
[SPEAKER_00]: like the type like you were talking about
earlier, proper watering technique,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're making sure the roots aren't
like super dry and they're not super wet
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can promote root health with soil
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add these compost teas and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've been talking about to promote
the type of microbes that you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them lots of space to grow,
obviously more roots equals more exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a nice big root ball,
I'm a big fan of big root balls,
[SPEAKER_00]: though, because it's my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably what I would say is
good root health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I think that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, again, it's so hard to say how
to get good root health and it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So philosophically speaking, these kind of
conversations help, too, because you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find people all over the place that have
different ways of making sure they have
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe one of those ends up working for
your particular strain or type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: No surprise that you're a big fan of root
balls being up there in B.C., the land of
[SPEAKER_02]: Natasha Riz, who's been on the show
talking about root balls as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Canadian friends all love the love the
cannabis root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good roots equals good plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice to come to an end of an
episode without anything new we have to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, usually when we go through these
episodes at the end, there's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I need I need to learn about this and
I need to start adding this and I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn how to start, you know, making this
Korean natural farming prep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, at the end of the story,
we've learned a whole ton about exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so a we stop repeating bro science and
B, we have like a more intimate
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with an understanding of the
biology of our plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, if if you're already studying
living soil and trying to have a healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: soil like the exudates will take care of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's so delightful to just be
able to get new understanding without new
[SPEAKER_02]: tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root health is just, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep doing what you're doing and grow
the healthiest plants that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the plant is very good at taking
care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give it the opportunity to then
you won't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sarah, thank you so much for sharing
your time and expertise with us today on
[SPEAKER_02]: shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mentioned this in the
introduction to the show that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you really do have a rare
specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to find somebody who is doing this at
the at the PhD research level and also is
[SPEAKER_02]: a home cannabis cultivator makes you
exceptionally unique to be able to bridge
[SPEAKER_02]: between the academic science side of
exudates and our beloved cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you for, you know,
taking two hours and sharing it with us so
[SPEAKER_02]: that that we can all become more familiar
with exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absolutely my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to keep up with Sarah Lane,
the best place to do that is through her
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter and her Twitter account is
exudetrootly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's E-X-U-D-E-T-T-E-R-O-O-T-L-Y.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a great place to keep up on her
research and her interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to have a like a more of an
elaborate question or comment,
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps, then a, you know, a Twitter
account will allow.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also invites you to send an email if
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lane, S-L-A-N-E at uvic.ca.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's U-V-I-E.
