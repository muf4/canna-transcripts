[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that the internet has not been
very good at yet is providing quality
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information, and if you
dig through it, read it all, and educate
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, you can eventually become a good
judge of information's quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if any topic is new to you,
good luck getting good, clean information
[SPEAKER_01]: without reading all of the information
available and becoming an expert yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This applies especially to cannabis,
and that aspect of cannabis legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: is such a drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients are literally dying while trying
to learn about accurate cannabis dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: and watching videos on how to make feco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other patients are trying to figure out
how to make full plant tinctures,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every tincture recipe is different,
and most of them are poorly written,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some are straight up ineffective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fake news sites and other media sources
that are not really fake, but rather just
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat dumb analysis, are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with no expertise write about
cannabis policy without any real context,
[SPEAKER_01]: and certainly there is enough snark and
ridicule in the comments everywhere to be
[SPEAKER_01]: disheartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk to one source of
cannabis information online that is well
[SPEAKER_01]: researched, pure rated, and
technologically advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's guest is Max Simon, founder and
CEO of Greenflower Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenflower works with the top cannabis
experts in the world to create reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: programming to educate patients,
cannabis enthusiasts, business owners,
[SPEAKER_01]: and policy makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenflower's Cannabis Health Summit and
Cannabis Entrepreneur Summit are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: highly attended cannabis education events
ever to take place online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to launching Greenflower,
Max produced programming and outreach for
[SPEAKER_01]: Deepak Chopra, rebranded the company,
and led technological innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a down to earth communicator who has
a profound understanding of technology and
[SPEAKER_01]: how we learn as humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken at the Greenflower Cannabis
Entrepreneur Summit, as well as recorded a
[SPEAKER_01]: show with them on how best to set up
cannabis clubs in your local area.
[SPEAKER_01]: My new program, Seven Mistakes Made by New
Cannabis Entrepreneurs, debuts next week
[SPEAKER_01]: on January 3rd at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: The showing is free, and then will be
added to the Greenflower Library.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find out more about that event at
shapingfire.com forward slash greenflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some call Greenflower the Netflix of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will discuss that with Max today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be here with you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you could make the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start by giving folks a little
context about where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that you helped Deepak Chopra
develop his video outreach program,
[SPEAKER_01]: but tell us a little bit about that and
how it informed your vision for what
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenflower Media was to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to even embrace this now,
but over a decade ago, I was the director
[SPEAKER_00]: of consumer products for the Chopra
Center, which is Deepak Chopra's wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to paint a picture, if you will,
at that time, this was way before
[SPEAKER_00]: meditation, yoga, Ayurveda, mind-body
medicine was deemed acceptable and
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it has an eerie coincidence or an
eerie similarity to the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_00]: because in that world, people saw
meditation and yoga as something that
[SPEAKER_00]: people only on the fringe did,
that there was no science to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was going to disrupt your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were all these stigmas attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of the seven years that I
was there and the team that we built,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really did some unbelievable things to
de-stigmatize meditation and mind-body
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and yoga and to really get the
message out to tens of millions of people
[SPEAKER_00]: through online campaigns and the
meditation challenge that now I just heard
[SPEAKER_00]: has been taken by a half a million people
this year at the Chopra Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really fascinating experience to
take something that was so fringe and
[SPEAKER_00]: really integrated into mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, it feels just like this
unusual path that I've already walked
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but this time, it's with something
I have an even deeper relationship with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a cannabis user for decades and
I also, in a funny way, think that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is even bigger than mind-body
medicine because I taught some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest stars and celebrities in the world
how to meditate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would teach these people,
you would always say to them, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do this every day for 21 days
for you to really start to notice some
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit because if anybody's ever
meditated before, you know the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: you sit down to meditate, you feel like,
oh, so I'm just going to sit here for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and let my mind drive me freaking
nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit to get the hang of
it and use the tools and work through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, it's like I put an
arthritis cream on my grandfather's hands
[SPEAKER_00]: and in 30 minutes, all of a sudden,
he could move his fingers again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave my mother, who hadn't slept in
three decades, a little bit of a chew and
[SPEAKER_00]: she slept through the night that same
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you combine the fact that I think
this plant has the capacity to impact
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of millions of people in so many
different ways and that it's so quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, I just feel really excited
about the path that we're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this funny background of taking
things that have been highly stigmatized
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet also highly effective in helping
them come into the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how all the puzzle pieces fit
together so elegantly when you look
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like, you know, looking back,
we can see, you know, the kind of programs
[SPEAKER_01]: you put together at the Chopra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also then, with the marriage of the
technology that you were learning and
[SPEAKER_01]: managing there, it pretty much gave you a
full skill set to do exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing now in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, you know, on some level,
the universe is always conspiring in our
[SPEAKER_00]: favor if we're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes people being willing to take
some risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, you know, I see cannabis as a
health and wellness movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have that background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also see cannabis as something that
needs really good education to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for what we've, you know, really done
at Green Flower, it's about changing
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma to me is about two core things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's about knowledge because people
are just misinformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start to learn about
anything, you quickly realize the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that happened with meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's happening with cannabis
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis, it's just such a diverse,
rich topic full of so much fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one part to changing stigma is
just doing a better and better job of
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second part of that is
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more credible, the more high level,
the more authoritative, the more celebrity
[SPEAKER_00]: you bring into something, the more it
starts to change public persona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And change the perception of what this
thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when I was at Chopra,
I had this just unusually long list of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I dealt with of celebrities
that were sick, you know, celebrities,
[SPEAKER_00]: business moguls, you know, high level
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that people are just
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how big of a star they are,
no matter where they come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you treat people like regular
people, then it gets better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of allow that
relationship to become more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with cannabis, it's again,
it's the same darn thing where people
[SPEAKER_00]: might be highly stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm getting into bigger and bigger
circles right now of more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity driven, affluent driven people
that are using cannabis because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not sleeping or because they got cancer or
because they have pain or whatever else it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I'm very proud to have
people like Eugene Monroe, who's become
[SPEAKER_00]: such an industry actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advocate who is a major part of Green
Flower and people like Steve D'Angelo,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's, you know, been an activist for so
long to be a part of Green Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if we can just keep doing
those two things, education and people,
[SPEAKER_00]: education and people, then I'm convinced
that within 10 years, it'll be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that happened to Chopra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have cannabis shops on every corner
and tens of millions of people will be
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from the plant in a more public
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's a it's a
really interesting, interesting thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing now with the background that I
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is amazing the reach that Green
Flower Media has put together in such a,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, feels like to me a short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I heard about your company
was going into the Cannabis Health Summit
[SPEAKER_01]: that you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe maybe it was a year
and a half, two years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny thing was, you know,
I'm knee deep in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't I didn't get contacted
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually heard about it from a
non-cannabis aunt who sent me a new
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter that you all put out and said,
oh, look at this great Cannabis Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be something that you would be
interested in, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: She was totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and I was stoked that you had all
these amazing cannabis health experts that
[SPEAKER_01]: were all going to be streaming for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, man, I'm going to sign
up for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I signed up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of the weekend,
I probably caught, heck, I probably caught
[SPEAKER_01]: eight speakers or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then, you know, and then
after that, you did the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Entrepreneurs Summit, which I was very
grateful to have been invited to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so my question for you is that,
you know, when you put together one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these summits, it's like two days,
it's all the top minds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are really busy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine getting all these folks
together over one weekend was like herding
[SPEAKER_01]: cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find it challenging to pull
everybody together at the same place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the thing about experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I've learned after
being in the kind of experts business for
[SPEAKER_00]: a decade, because after I left Chopra,
I started a company that trained over
[SPEAKER_00]: eight thousand thought leaders on how to
build digital marketing systems to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their knowledge and their wisdom out into
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have this kind of deep,
vast experience with network with experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've learned is that when
somebody acquires enough knowledge to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like they have something of value to
share, what people are really looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: most is two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for a platform,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to reach more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, we're looking for ways to
enhance our visibility and credibility in
[SPEAKER_00]: greater ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it actually wasn't terribly
difficult to get people together because
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew that with our marketing channels
and the strategies that we put in place in
[SPEAKER_00]: the background that my team has,
I have a remarkable team of 13 people deep
[SPEAKER_00]: now of, you know, true experts in kind of
digital publishing that our reach was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the other part of my team
that works with people on content,
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew that we could help people become
better speakers, better presenters and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the production quality of what we
were going to do, because my, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: my executive producer was 30 years at
Marvel and Disney and Fox and Spotlight
[SPEAKER_00]: Entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so between our production and our
marketing, we could invite people into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was of true value and true
benefit to them and do it in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: really lifted up their credibility and
helped them get their message out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually the hardest thing was not
getting people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest thing was deciding who we
wanted because we are perpetually being
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted by so many people around the
world that think they're experts or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: are experts, but not at the level we
necessarily want them to be at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the hardest part is actually the
filtering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, because everybody wants to
participate because they can smell a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially with how big your reach
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't actually hear the
follow-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the public response to this sort
of large free online event?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I had never heard of
anything like this happening in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did people respond to it other than,
you know, my aunt and I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 28,000 people tune in to the
first cannabis health summit, which by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, it was just in January of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too long ago.
Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: How time flies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 28,300 people from, I don't
remember exactly, but I think it was from
[SPEAKER_00]: like 55 countries or some unbelievable
diversity of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Cannabis Entrepreneur Summit
had 10,800 people attend that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really did help put us on the map
if you will, in terms of people seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: what we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know the exact numbers,
but I want to say that between those two
[SPEAKER_00]: events, people watched something like 2.5
million minutes of content over those two
[SPEAKER_00]: days, or over those two events,
I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, speaking of reach, we also have
started live streaming just individual
[SPEAKER_00]: classes every week on Green Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can go and they can sign up to
watch any live class basically we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple live streams a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also just recently pulled those
stats and have had 3.9 million minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: live stream class content watched this
year as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been phenomenal to see the level
of engagement and reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it comes back to the fact that
there's very few places where people can
[SPEAKER_00]: go to learn about the plant right now,
and especially learn from the most
[SPEAKER_00]: credible experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just built a really nice
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also built our own technology platform
to run the whole thing so that it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice user experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a cool thing we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really providing a
service that people are really grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, especially as we get bigger
and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a lot of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that it's probably the most
dense cannabis education event that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that many people learning about
cannabis, cannabis medicine and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty astonishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks, Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's guest is Max Simon of Greenflower
Media, and you are listening to Shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like podcasts like Shaping Fire,
chances are that you will like audio books
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much audio books are like podcasts,
except with less stuttering, better
[SPEAKER_01]: production quality and more targeted
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make audio books sound better than a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, maybe they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like podcasts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to learn from people talking to me
while I'm doing something else like
[SPEAKER_01]: driving or cleaning my house or making
dinner or even being at work, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Audible.com has an offer I want to tell
you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they are offering a trial of
their audio book service for absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to shapingfire.com forward
slash audible and you will get a free
[SPEAKER_01]: audio book straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can listen to it on your mobile
device, on your computer, or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: download it and listen to it, you know,
pretty much anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, they really want you
to subscribe to their service forever and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy more and more audio books.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as cannabis users, you also know how
this goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna hate I've said that,
but it's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I listened recently to Smoke
Signals by Martin Lee from projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martin's book is a classic of cannabis
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He explains the history of cannabis in
America, THC and CBD cannabis science and
[SPEAKER_01]: why cannabis policy in America has gotten
so jacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you consider yourself a
cannabis person, this book really is a
[SPEAKER_01]: must.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking cannabis, we all sound radical
just because we're talking about weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you learn the history and science
of cannabis, suddenly you become smart and
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book was really incredible and there's
no doubt that Martin Lee is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the book for free just for
doing the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you don't want to listen to a
cannabis book, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sci-fi and history, biography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, you can even listen to a book about
card counting in Blackjack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first book is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do do a pretty good job making me
want to stay every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash
audible to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Max Simon,
founder and CEO of Green Flower Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking
about, you know, just how many people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're reaching now with Green Flower and
how behind it is this structure of
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and experienced people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one of the things that
occurs to me is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: over the time that I've been following
Green Flower, it does feel like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the direction or the business
model at least once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so many entrepreneurs,
they're either they're either,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, poo-pooed by their friends for
changing or they themselves feel shame for
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the direction of their company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always thought that, you know,
it's important to be sensitive to what
[SPEAKER_01]: your audience wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you share for a little bit,
you know, what your experience has been
[SPEAKER_01]: over the arc of Green Flower so far and
how the business model has evolved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should start by saying that I'm a
huge subscriber and student of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Lean Startup Model by a guy
named Eric Ries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Lean Startup Model basically has a
philosophy which says that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: building a new business, you should be
testing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, instead of being concerned
about, quite frankly, even what your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers think or what your team thinks
or what your investors think or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, that everything is an experiment
and that in the beginning, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I say that because our first
experiment was more of what I would call a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional media company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I even entered the cannabis
space as an entrepreneur, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because I saw a huge, massive void.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that void was no high quality cannabis
content that demonstrated the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stigma, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically, the way I looked at it
is the vast majority of material that was
[SPEAKER_00]: out there wasn't portraying cannabis
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start thinking about
businesses, we thought, well, we could
[SPEAKER_00]: reach, you know, zillions of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the business model would be based upon
a media company that reaches a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which is, i.e., an advertising
model, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different business models for
media companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started going down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the premise behind a media company
like that is you produce as much content
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can, you get as many eyeballs as
you can, and then you sell advertisements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while we were getting a lot of
eyeballs and we were getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: traction with the tribe, if you will,
we were barely selling any advertisements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was starting to get pretty scary
because we just were not, couldn't see a
[SPEAKER_00]: path in sight to be able to sustain the
kind of impact that I am here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet to make, for better or worse,
and the kind of person that is 100% driven
[SPEAKER_00]: by global impact and by big, massive
global impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when I looked at Green
Flower originally, I was thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, for that to get to that level,
you know, it basically would take a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the business model was,
quite frankly, failing, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all I could say, like we were
generating a little bit of income,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nowhere near the kind of numbers that
I knew was necessary to create a business
[SPEAKER_00]: that would sustain itself, we had to
really look deep and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where, you know, the funny
thing about my past reconverges because in
[SPEAKER_00]: media, there's really only two models when
it comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an ad model, which is based upon
publishing free content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a premium model,
which is based upon producing content that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are willing to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually have had a much deeper
background in premium, but I just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just pivoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pivoted to being a premium content
business, if you will, that was based upon
[SPEAKER_00]: creating content people were willing to
pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a different kind of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more how-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's content that's designed to provide
specific value to somebody based upon a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem or a desire that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the greatest decision we could
have made because one, there was very few
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were, they weren't doing it
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also it was quite frankly,
just much more in our sweet spot as well
[SPEAKER_00]: from our experience and our depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we're able to carve out this
kind of beautiful niche that is working
[SPEAKER_00]: very well, both in the financial side,
but also in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we feel most comfortable playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe that about the place where
you feel more comfortable playing too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because one of the challenges with
advertising as a model for media companies
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, you're always aware of what
your advertisers want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet I know you to be somebody who's
very service oriented to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that a premium model where
the audience is helping pay for the
[SPEAKER_01]: content is way more emotionally effective
for you because that way your loyalties
[SPEAKER_01]: are not split between advertisers and the
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything that you can do for the
audience to create value for them is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, was what you're supposed to
be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that fitting a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about it for us as well
is that it really does allow us to use our
[SPEAKER_00]: tribe, as I call it, or our audience,
if you will, to guide the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a premium content model,
if I was to get really granular for a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment, it's really actually just about
solving problems for people that they
[SPEAKER_00]: believe are valuable enough to pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start moving into premium
content, it's just saying, how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: create increasingly more valuable content?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by asking people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at this point, we've got tens of
thousands of data points because of our
[SPEAKER_00]: technology about what are the issues
people are struggling with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for example, one of our most
popular classes was about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was because people were really
struggling to find a way to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to enhance their creativity without making
them anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't have thought that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that I wouldn't have
known unless our audience told us,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, here's a problem I'm having.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that are creative were
either getting really anxious or they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't finding the right way of doing it
to enhance the way they think about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of was a surprising data
point for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because our model is based upon
creating more and more valuable content
[SPEAKER_00]: for the people that are paying for it,
you know, it's become a nice kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-perpetuating loop to design stuff
that's really valuable to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes a really good case,
too, for listening to your customer base,
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody who's listening,
who's an entrepreneur, that you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: really great insight if you're making sure
you read the emails that are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: your email box from your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can show you roads that you had not
considered yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really uncomfortable to ask
people for what to do, not even what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but what to do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, really, that's at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how do we serve you better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we not doing that you'd like us
to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very uncomfortable experience
because, you know, everybody wants to have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's also very much a lean
startup principle is you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly trying stuff and then reviewing
how people responded to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's necessary, I think,
quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, while we're talking about
uncomfortable things about being an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur and running a startup,
let's talk about raising money real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, entrepreneurs are often really
shy to the fact that they have to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you've raised money
successfully for a few businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for cannabis
entrepreneurs who are raising their own
[SPEAKER_01]: capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, just to clarify, this is the
first business that I've had to raise real
[SPEAKER_00]: money for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've raised, you know,
a few hundred thousand dollars here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, friends and family in my
network wasn't that difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first business where I had to
fully go out and hit the road and go pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: and do that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And holy smokes, I tell everybody I know
these days that it was the deepest and
[SPEAKER_00]: still continues to be the deepest and most
profound learning curve I've ever gone on
[SPEAKER_00]: in my professional career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start by saying raising money is
definitely not for the fainted heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've failed more times than I've ever
failed at anything in my entire career so
[SPEAKER_00]: far at raising money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I would say is
you have to be really prepared to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with rejection in a way that I just
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wasn't thinking it was going to
be this hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I would say is that I've
learned some really fascinating things
[SPEAKER_00]: about investors in this last period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now raised a few million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've learned is
that people always think that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and pitch an investor and that,
you know, basically they're the prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some level, psychologically,
what's happening for people is I need your
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need to impress you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the person that's the prize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the greatest thing I've
learned in this process is that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have that attitude, you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you have to come up with the ways of
thinking about yourself and your business
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're doing and the energy that
you cultivate and the story you tell and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you approach people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you're the prize and that you're
giving them an opportunity to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they feel like you're chasing
them, you're never going to close a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they feel like they're going to
miss something by not chasing you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when people start to actually write
checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I could talk to you for
literally days on the investment thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the single most important
lesson that I've learned is you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically turn the tables to making
you the prize, even if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense because you're
removing that duality that I'm negotiating
[SPEAKER_01]: with you and you're the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, you're stepping across a line
and, you know, embracing what it is they
[SPEAKER_01]: want for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're on the same side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that the capital conversation
becomes way, way easier at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say any part of it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I think that raising money is
arguably the most difficult business task
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, speaking to the startup
side of things, the reason why I love
[SPEAKER_00]: business actually has nothing to do with
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a very money driven person,
even though I think it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driven by in business by two things
primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've said many times before,
I think that's my my number one motivation
[SPEAKER_00]: as I feel like if we're here on this
earth, we're here to do something that
[SPEAKER_00]: contributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my number one drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second is the leadership
opportunity or you could say it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: leadership challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raising money is so far been the
single greatest leadership challenge I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had to take on in business thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can frame it that way,
I hear most people, I hate raising money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst and it could be really
hard, but it's an amazing leadership
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to step into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have learned more about the
psychology of desire and persuasion and
[SPEAKER_00]: urgency by becoming better and better at
raising money than any single activity
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done in the history of my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that, Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's guest is Max Simon of Green Flower
Media and you are listening to Shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know though that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting in a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential and that is what we
offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_01]: will help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_01]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can totally do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because our podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you're going to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost we will be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, everyone listening both now and
to the back catalog of interviews in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future will hear about your company again
and again for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Max Simon,
founder and CEO of Green Flower Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far we've been talking a whole lot
about the nature of a cannabis startup and
[SPEAKER_01]: running a business with integrity and,
you know, just trying to build a company
[SPEAKER_01]: in this very unusual cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to talk more specifically now
about the content because at the heart of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you are a publishing company and you
are trying to find companies content that
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you, as you mentioned in the last set,
you know, your goal is to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that people have and try to solve
it for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's talk about some of your free
events that are coming up in the new year
[SPEAKER_01]: so that folks can get an idea of the kind
of content you are producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's coming up for Green Flower Media?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have learned that there's basically
four areas in this cannabis movement where
[SPEAKER_00]: people have a strong desire to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one area is the health vertical and
that encapsulates everything from how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: use this for my specific ailment?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I treat other people or recommend
this to other people?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the difference between
cannabinoids and terpenes or how do I use
[SPEAKER_00]: them to my benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's about a zillion things
that people want and need to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a tremendous diversity of
classes in those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say so far that's probably been
our strongest place because, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a lot of our health background.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people on the team have a very
strong health background, including
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So classes like cannabis and pregnancy
coming up, you know, about whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: safe or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have cannabis and Alzheimer's and
cannabis and opiate pain and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just some really interesting classes there
with famous doctors and mind, body
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine practitioners and all sorts of
interesting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second vertical is the industry
vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all about starting or building
or succeeding in this cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have classes with you coming
out, Shango, and we have classes around
[SPEAKER_00]: investing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have classes around compliance and
classes around protecting your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: brand and classes around building a
cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a pretty diverse range
of really fascinating topics coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve D'Angelo is doing a whole thing
about what he's learned from building the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's largest cannabis brand,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that whole sector vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the science vertical,
which is all about the biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and ways to work with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really thrilled that we've
developed some amazing partnerships in
[SPEAKER_00]: that area, like the Cannabis Science
Conference, where that entire conference
[SPEAKER_00]: will actually be made available to our
insiders, which is our membership program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Emerald Scientific Conference,
as well as another one that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: partnered with, where their entire
three-day conference will be included to
[SPEAKER_00]: our insider portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes everything from
extraction to the ways of working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and growing the plant and genetics
and that whole kind of amazingly rich
[SPEAKER_00]: category of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we have what we call our
DIY vertical, which is all about basically
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking, growing, making your own products
and tinctures and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a whole slew of really
interesting classes in that one as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing indoor and outdoor and working
with some of the real legends in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't name them for now until it comes
out, but really, you know, the legends in
[SPEAKER_00]: this space that have been doing this for
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that content is really,
we have a really interesting model where
[SPEAKER_00]: because our number one desire is impact,
we always live stream these classes first
[SPEAKER_00]: for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every week, multiple times a week,
people can tune in to the website and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can register for these classes for free
and they can watch in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's all that happens,
then that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have right now, you know,
thousands and thousands of people every
[SPEAKER_00]: week that are tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have this ability for
people to basically unlock the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: library for, you know, it's just 18 bucks
a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we have a lot of cool
stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're tantalizing folks,
I want to give you the URL right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll say this again at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if you want to attend some
of these free online events, you can go to
[SPEAKER_01]: shapingfire.com forward slash green flower
to sign up for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because of the nature of
podcasts that they that they're on,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're online forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are listening to this show in the
future, you can still go to shapingfire
[SPEAKER_01]: .com green flower and it'll be a
constantly refreshed list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always going to be evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Max, you know, as far as finding these
topics, you know, you professed earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: that you paid a lot of attention to your
audience so that you knew what the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems you could solve for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you find is your best way to get
feedback from your audience, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tens and tens of thousands of
people deep now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're over seventy five thousand
now, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it goes back to
just the idea of making it a muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, at least, you'll find once you
register for any of these classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment you register, we say,
hey, tell us what you want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our technology, it's now built
in that every class we're gathering
[SPEAKER_00]: people's questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, we're actually
answering them live, like right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: spot during the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one way that we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also, you know, we have a certain
set of values of how we operate here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those values is to be open and
curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, what that means is that,
you know, we're human and people
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes forget companies are like made
up of actual, just real people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a team of people, we make mistakes
sometimes or we do something wrong or we,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, find ourselves having made a
decision that wasn't the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just always trying to
communicate that we're very open and
[SPEAKER_00]: curious with everybody to tell us,
you know, if they have feedback or if they
[SPEAKER_00]: have some kind of guidance that will help
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of it's just kind of
tactical, you know, ask more, ask more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently, ask in every way that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other way is a value set
that's really served us and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly served me in my life many times
is just being kind of humble enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, you know, tell us if there's
something else we can do to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that play into the development of
the Cannabis Health Challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been seeing new advertising for that
all over the place right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say first, we're really excited
about this Cannabis Health Challenge,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically what we're doing is it's
an online challenge that for 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to release a daily video that
will teach and educate people about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis responsibly and perform three
health enhancing activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's cannabis and fitness,
cannabis and food and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be kind of guiding
people through it as a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really amazing people
taking part in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that that's one of those things while
speaking of our values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have another value that says,
break new ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, this was actually just a very
strong gut decision of my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly because I'm a I'm a very,
very active, healthy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis has become a substantial part
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I have I live out here
in Ojai, California, this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain town, and we have these gorgeous
outdoor trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about three days a week, I'll go for a
pretty long trail run with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had gone on these trail runs,
and I just kept getting this message over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again, I'm running on this trail
and puffing away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do a health challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it because I used to do
stuff like this with Chopra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did stuff like some other companies,
these online challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just a gut instinct to say,
let's let's do this as a community and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can really inspire our cannabis
community to come together and really
[SPEAKER_00]: prove to ourselves and others that
cannabis can be a true life enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really exciting to see the
response so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm excited for everybody
to take part in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they can find that through that
URL that you mentioned before in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: how they can register for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Max, before we go, you know,
I wanted to talk about this this tagline
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm hearing about Greenflower Media
in the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading folks refer to your new
subscription service as the Netflix of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are some pretty big boots to
fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the tagline fits for what
Greenflower Media has become?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the the thing that that the reason
why they're calling us that is because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have this program called Greenflower
Insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an insider, what it means is that
every single live class that we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is multiple times a week,
gets added to this ever growing library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for, you know, it's 18 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can watch unlimited cannabis
classes, including every new one that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that way, we're just like
Netflix, because we have this ever growing
[SPEAKER_00]: library of really credible cannabis
education and cannabis classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis material that people can can
enjoy any time they want and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can binge watch as much as they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where where we differ is that our our
content is really more like classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and in that regard, we have a
different model, which is more like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Linda dot com or a Udemy or a creative
live, because we're actually teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for for most of the cases,
you know, if you were to go to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar or a cannabis event, you know,
you'd have to spend hundreds and hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars or sometimes thousands of
dollars to go and listen to these people
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have those same thousands and
thousands of dollars of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just 18 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we love that that people are seeing
how big what it is that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're so education focused and
value driven, and Netflix is more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment platform, it kind of works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also doesn't, you know,
and we kind of see ourselves more as we
[SPEAKER_00]: would compare ourselves more like a Linda
dot com of cannabis more than a Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly the fact that that we unlock
every class in our library people are less
[SPEAKER_00]: than the price of a pizza is something
that people have been really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I certainly get the excitement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, even though I spend most
of my time interviewing folks and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn about exactly what I want to
learn in cannabis, it's always nice to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the new addition is to the library so
that, you know, in the evening when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: eating dinner or something I can watch and
learn something that I didn't already
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Max, thank you so much for all the
work that you're doing to educate folks on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and kind of like raising the
torch.

time out of your busy schedule to be on

kind of amazing thing that you're building
