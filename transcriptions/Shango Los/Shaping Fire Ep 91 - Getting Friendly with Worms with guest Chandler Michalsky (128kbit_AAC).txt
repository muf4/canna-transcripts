[SPEAKER_00]: When I was growing up, my dad often
repeated to me the famous adage by Zig
[SPEAKER_00]: Ziglar that you can get what you want by
helping enough people get what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea, of course, is that by helping
others reach their goals, you create
[SPEAKER_00]: value, and the creation of value attracts
value for yourself from other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having the same thought about worms
the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much like humans, worms want to eat well,
have a safe place to live, make out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and procreate, and then repeat that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, to reach my goals in the garden,
I also want my worms to be safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: fed, and procreate, so I prepare a place
for them in my garden that is responsive
[SPEAKER_00]: to their biological needs and creates a
living environment for them to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In turn, they keep my living soil thriving
and fully functioning to support my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, humans get what we want by
helping the worms get what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a great relationship.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Chandler Michalski.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chandler is a microbe and worm farmer and
a regenerative farming educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is co-founder of the Michigan Compost
Cup and Symposium and founder of Beer City
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is presently the director of living
soil and farm manager at Wormies and a
[SPEAKER_00]: proud member of the West Michigan Growers
Group and the Vermin Microbiome Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're gonna talk about worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we're gonna talk
about worm physiology and activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we will describe a
variety of applications and preparations
[SPEAKER_00]: for worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last set, we will get a better
understanding of how to set up worm bins
[SPEAKER_00]: and worm piles to create your own
inexhaustible supply of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chandler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shango, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, let's start by identifying
the attributes of worms that we find so
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll be first to say that
I'm a novice when it comes to worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that worms are good for my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, whenever I find them in
the yard, I put them in my pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only really aware of what I think
are the two main advantages of worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is they're wiggling around and
aerates the soil, and then they're poop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, more properly are known
as castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this entire episode is
pretty much about worm poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are the worm castings themselves so
nutritive for the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so worms are absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the castings from earthworms contain
from five to 11 times the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: available NPK as the soil that the worms
ate to produce those castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll eat this organic matter,
either the mineral soil or the organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, all the leaf litter up on top,
and they will just absolutely increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of available nutrients for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do that by grinding it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole thing, the anatomy of
the worm, but basically they have like
[SPEAKER_02]: this gizzard that's full of sand and
little rock particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this long muscle to kind of grind
up all the food scraps that they're eating
[SPEAKER_02]: and get it into small enough particles
that all of the microbes, all the bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: in their intestine can further break down
those nutrients and deliver available
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients to the worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything else is just excreted
in the castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a waste product for the worm,
but it's absolutely black gold for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And vermicompost or worm castings are 50%
higher in organic matter than soil that
[SPEAKER_02]: has not been worked through worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically just that higher increase
in organic matter is going to increase all
[SPEAKER_02]: the charge holding surfaces there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to increase the cation
exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically all the nutrients that
are there in the soil can then attach to
[SPEAKER_02]: the worm castings and be right there
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that in cannabis
cultivation, we're always talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: adding or improving the nutrients so that
they are plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of both discussion and
straight up arguments online about people
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about whether or not this additive
or that additive is plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like these worms are just
like a plant available nutrition machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to you describe it, I'm like,
wow, I would like to take everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in my container garden and just run
it through worms because it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever goes through them comes out as an
upgrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge upgrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to think of the microbiome of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really easy to just see a worm and
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just a worm or see a tree and
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just a tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But inside of that tree, there could be a
hundred different strains of fungi living
[SPEAKER_02]: in it, performing their various roles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that just goes unthought of to
most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But same thing with the worm is they have
their own microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're inoculating everything that
passes through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are biology factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are like, you know, wiggling
communities of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how we create these plant
available nutrients is by cycling them
[SPEAKER_02]: through biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like same as fermentation,
same as composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's returning these fully grown,
like proteins back to their peptides,
[SPEAKER_02]: back to their amino acids and creating
like the building blocks that you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: to apply to any of these other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an incredible process for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was imagining when you
described it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, they're kind of like doing
natural farming preps inside of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of us who are into natural farming
and KNF, worms are a clear win for us
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are doing a similar kind of
work that we do when we're making these
[SPEAKER_00]: preps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're doing it 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's talk about what they're
eating because I believe that they eat
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the food scraps, but I also
believe that they eat perhaps microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: like pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're, they're, they're also cleaning
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are like 7,000 known species of
earthworms around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that being said, there's only about
16 or so that are well studied and deemed
[SPEAKER_02]: like good for composting, good for,
for gardening and whatnot that are highly
[SPEAKER_02]: understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of them, there's so many
worms out there, but yeah, it's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do eat the organic matter,
but mainly they are eating the microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are breaking down that organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly the bacteria, but also the fungi,
the nematodes, the protozoa, everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's breaking down these food scraps and
that organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, they, they add the calcium
carbonate in their gut and all of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: all those microbes that are, you know,
doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so their castings are full of that
calcium, but full of all the, the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that the feedstock contained,
but now in a plant available form that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been cycled through the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's a popular comparison and
what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The teaming with microbes, they compare
like bacteria to bags of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you have these microbes that
are mining minerals out of the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they become bags of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all those nutrients within
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have these plants that are
attracting that bacteria and those
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes up to the root zone so they can
drink the exudates that the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: producing for those microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the plant attracts the certain
microbes that it needs that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: contains the certain nutrients that it
needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a larger trophic level organism
will come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like protists and nematodes will come
in and they will eat that bacteria and
[SPEAKER_02]: they will take what they need and leave
the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they rip open that bag of
fertilizer right there in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how it's plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because the bacteria worked through
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like the mineral itself before the
bacteria worked through it and then was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, ripped apart is not plants
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you need that biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like that's how nutrient cycling
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we feed our plants with
synthetic salt-based fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it disrupts that natural cycle that,
you know, as billions of years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get these plants that no longer
need to, you know, take some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic energy and put it down
specifically to feed the microbes because
[SPEAKER_02]: they say, oh, that's a whole lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I do that when, you know,
the farmer can just give me the synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer that I can just uptake right
away?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you might see some results by
feeding with synthetics for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that does not last long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually going to dumb down
your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to dumb down your microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make your plants literally
like reliant on that chemical fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: every time because they no longer know
what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you make lazy soil that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by, you know, involving the worms,
choosing to not use salts and to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web that is, you know,
pretty much at the base of regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, we are maximizing our substrate's
ability to do all of the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in very active communication
between the plant and the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the life there.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that we will get back more to
the nutritive quality of the castings at a
[SPEAKER_00]: further point in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second thing I'm aware of is like
just the worms existence in the soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: good because as we all know, especially
when using containers, your soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: become compacted over time and the
squiggling around of the worms aerates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you break that out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, there are a bunch of
different species of worms and then there
[SPEAKER_02]: are like four main categories of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like the tunnel and burrow and
different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like the red wigglers that we're
common with, super common composting
[SPEAKER_02]: worms, they'll hardly burrow into the soil
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to stay on like that top six to
eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll eat a lot of the organic matter
and they'll reproduce really quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: produce a lot of cocoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like your night crawlers are going to
tunnel more like straight down and create
[SPEAKER_02]: these air columns that are going to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like different worms will tunnel in
different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are going to go,
you know, more straight up and down,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, some are going to go
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like both of those are creating
these channels and they fill in those
[SPEAKER_02]: channels with organic matter that
continues to decompose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like some of these air channels
that these tunnels that they make will
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually fill in with the organic matter
and water and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it creates the perfect little
channel for roots to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like the roots are always looking
for the path of least resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they can find this old
mineshaft basically, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like that's this old tunnel that's
totally full of worm poop and still
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking down organic matter and all those
microbes that are associated with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's literally everything that the
root needs and the perfect little channel
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, their burrows are incredibly
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard a worm tunnel sound so
attractive, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a plant root, I'd be like,
hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a, it's like a nutritive slip
and slide all the way to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a, and a healthy acre of like food
production soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your farm field, your garden,
um, you're going to find two to 3 million
[SPEAKER_02]: worms in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that comes down to like 50 or
between 10 and 50 worms per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot of worms and some
health healthy soil, and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely capable of moving about 18 tons
of soil every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while they're looking for their food,
while they're creating their, their
[SPEAKER_02]: tunnels, they're taking some of those
minerals from down and like these night
[SPEAKER_02]: crawlers are taking it from up to like 12
feet down below the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're taking a lot of those minerals
and depositing up, up on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're taking some of this leaf
litter and bringing it back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, they're absolutely changing
both the physical structure, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: like the chemical composition of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a nice comparison is like,
worms are the beavers of the soil because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're the ecological engineers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they absolutely will change
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the garden, that's a wonderful
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take leaf litter that would have
taken one or two years to decompose and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll turn it over into available
nutrients in just three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, I'll say in the
forest, that might be not what you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, out in these native growth
forests.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you introduce a lot of earthworms,
which this happens a lot in the fishing
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, people have, you know,
their leftover bait, and they'll just dump
[SPEAKER_02]: that out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially up in North America,
in the northern states and up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: where there used to be glaciers,
there's a lot of areas that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: earthworm free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people don't consider
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after the last ice age, there were no
earthworms up in Canada and the northern
[SPEAKER_02]: United States up in the Great Lakes region
where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were totally wiped out from the
glacial ice sheets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for thousands of years after that,
there's remained areas that were totally
[SPEAKER_02]: earthworm free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they weren't reintroduced until
European settlers came and brought with
[SPEAKER_02]: them and their food crops and their
ornamental crops, but also just the
[SPEAKER_02]: ballast of their ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd used to fill up the bottom of their
ship with stones and soil to keep it from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, popping out of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to weigh it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once they got to the New World,
they'd take all that soil that was down on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom and dump it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, they brought a lot of worms
and a lot of worm cocoons with them and
[SPEAKER_02]: totally re-inoculated this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much so that now, like, you can go out
into a field and you can dig and you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: find worms there that you didn't
introduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very common to think,
OK, these are native, but they were
[SPEAKER_02]: actually reintroduced up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I know that's a huge tangent
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but no, like, I want to go down that
tangent a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is interesting because if the
glaciers got rid of the worms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern part of the continent and they
were gone for thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means when settlers came and brought
them back, that they were actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species at that point because the
natural local plants had grown up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the local bio-region had developed without
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, they're aggressive
processors of, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: forest duff and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about this, but I can imagine
that there might be certain species in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern parts of the country that are
suffering because of these worms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all see as an ally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a tough pill to swallow,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thinks, oh, worms are absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are in a food production system,
in a non-natural environment, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But out in the native growth forest,
they can actually really be invasive and
[SPEAKER_02]: detrimental to a lot of native species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, you know, if you didn't
have worms, it would take multiple years
[SPEAKER_02]: for all the leaves to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, that's how you get that
beautiful layer of soil duff or the forest
[SPEAKER_02]: duff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have multiple layers of that
really spongy, rich, fertile humus that's
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly breaking down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much life that lives in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of the forest ecology depends
on that thick mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have worms come in,
they'll totally clean that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bare soil is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's definitely something to
consider, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're living in the middle of the
woods, maybe keep your worm bin in a bin
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of a pile there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big thing is the fishing,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's responsible for a lot of the
spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if humans don't spread them,
worms will only travel about a half a mile
[SPEAKER_02]: in a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so their populations generally stay
where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can travel very, very easily with
the help of humans, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fishermen idea where we're taking
worms to exotic locations where they may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be and then depositing them when we
leave, that reminds me a lot of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us about firewood, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't transport firewood because it's
filled with all these localized bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take these insects and other
species that live in firewood and move
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you could actually be destroying
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first heard that, that kind of
blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew me away because it's not very
intuitive at first to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither is this bit about worms
because in my head, worms are everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's still areas, like we're
saying up here, that are earthworm free.
[SPEAKER_02]: But down in the southern half of the
continent, there are still some native
[SPEAKER_02]: worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, you'll find two to three
million worms and a healthy acre of food
[SPEAKER_02]: production soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But out in the woods, you might only find
like 50,000 in an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's definitely still worms out
there, but nothing like you'd find in a
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't need to go through a lot of
species, but you've mentioned two already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've mentioned earthworms and then the
red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna talk more about setting up
worm bins in set three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, I wanna kind of focus
to this question where if we are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about adding worms to our containers and
beds, do we want to go for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: species or maybe two species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure that after this,
there's gonna be a lot of people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna wanna put a handful in their pots or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we be getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna touch on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is super common misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think earthworms are like a kind of
species and red wigglers are a different
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like earthworms are the broad
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red wigglers are one of the worms that are
earthworms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like you have red wigglers,
you have night crawlers, leaf worms,
[SPEAKER_02]: brown litter worms, all sorts of jumpers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got super reds, African night
crawlers, European night crawlers,
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian blue worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, they sound like cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most common around here are
absolutely the red wigglers, which will
[SPEAKER_02]: stay on the top six to eight inches,
like we said, as well as the European
[SPEAKER_02]: night crawlers, which will dive down a
little bit deeper and create those oxygen
[SPEAKER_02]: channels and allow the aeration and all
that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the ones that we personally
use at Wormies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a ton of other species that
are quote unquote native there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not truly native, but they've been
there for who knows how long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there well before we moved to
the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the benefit of us having our
compost piles directly on the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of up in these raised systems is
like you let everybody come and go as they
[SPEAKER_02]: please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you get maximum diversity
instead of up in an isolated stainless
[SPEAKER_02]: steel table or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for the common gardener,
you're going to want to look for some red
[SPEAKER_02]: wigglers and probably some European night
crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we don't really want to transport
worms around, should we be trying to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: from other folks locally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, supporting your local economy is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also at the same time, I know they
sell a lot of different varieties on
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and other online places not
to like, pick out Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that you can order them
online, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be avoiding buying them online
at all costs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, are we probably generally
safe to buy them online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the ones that are sold online are
so common, that if you're on a farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I don't know, it kind of goes a
couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want to support local as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of this stuff, when we're
talking about composting and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO, indigenous microorganisms,
it makes all the sense in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to buy your worms, one,
from a local business to support local and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But two, you know, to get those IMOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the worm pile that's in direct
contact with the soil, like we do at
[SPEAKER_02]: Wormies, it's so much more than just worm
castings and all the biology in the worm's
[SPEAKER_02]: gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally the indigenous
microorganisms culturing in that pile too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it makes so much more sense for
your garden to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like, you're not just getting a
handful of worms when you order worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be some substrate mixed
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, all the microbes that are
still in that substrate are really going
[SPEAKER_02]: to add some benefit to your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it depends on where you're putting
them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is only going to stay in your
indoor grow bin, in your indoor worm bin,
[SPEAKER_02]: it probably doesn't matter as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you always want to be cautious about
the invasive species thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the main issue is doing
this out in native, like old growth
[SPEAKER_02]: forests and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in your city, if you're in
your garden plot, they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: terribly invasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do a lot of good work for
you that will benefit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that whole idea of, you know,
localized IMO kind of brought this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: into my head about like potentially wild
crafting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember right before the pandemic,
I was at Indo Expo in Denver and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Waxman speak and he's got this great
video that he shows on his Living Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Talks where he takes half of an avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody calls it avocado tech
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he'll take half of an avocado and he
puts it at the top of his container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he lifts off the avocado after,
you know, some amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like a gazillion worms,
like all the worms in the container seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to have sensed the avocado fat and they
all come to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his argument about it is that it's
really good for feeding your worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also it brings them all in proximity
so that they can mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is kind of like a,
that's an attractant for worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any kind of, you know,
application of that or something else that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks might do to wild craft your local
worms that are going to have the local IMO
[SPEAKER_00]: in their gut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, you know, where I live on
Vashon Island, I could totally see going
[SPEAKER_00]: to the edge of my property where,
you know, it's not all trampled and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and, you know, take two
avocados and cut them in half and put four
[SPEAKER_00]: halves in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe dig away the top layer a
little bit and like, collect a bunch and
[SPEAKER_00]: start my, either, either start my bin or
just collect them and put them in my
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like A, is, is that an environmentally
sound practice if as long as I'm on my own
[SPEAKER_00]: farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And C, what attractant would you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to remember all those there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avocado tech's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll definitely attract a bunch of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, it's a great use for like
old avocados that, you know, are past
[SPEAKER_02]: prime eating, but I don't really like the
idea of, you know, buying an avocado from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like having that huge carbon footprint
just to, to feed to the worm and like all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of other stuff that we can
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to have actually already your
local IMO that you can use to bait those
[SPEAKER_02]: worms instead of microbes from Mexico or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me two examples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up here it's super, super easy to grow
melons and squash, all sorts of gourds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like that's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one squash plant and there's,
you know, 20 plus gourds on there and they
[SPEAKER_02]: store super well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, you know, have feed stock for
eight months plus if you store it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also that huge surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like you, you slice up a pumpkin
and you put it on top of the soil and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these, these worms are going to come up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar to the avocado, but also you
can just use like wet cardboard and like
[SPEAKER_02]: any leaves from your property,
toss some leaves under some wet cardboard,
[SPEAKER_02]: set that flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a couple of days, if there's
worms sitting in your yard, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they love that corrugated board,
all those little perforations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, they're eating it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They love like hanging out in the ridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can peel back one of the layers
and like, it's just full of worms and
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoons and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so yeah, anything, that's going to be
moist and flat and they like some pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: against the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like they like to come up to the
top, but you got to remember worms don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incredibly photo sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you can, you know, cover your
soil with something firm like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows them to come up to the top and
not be exposed to the elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really going to like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the idea with the avocado tech
is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cardboard, melons, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you basically attracting them and
worms are hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they contain both the sperm and the
eggs and that little slimy stuff that's on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically when you have them in a
huge worm pile, all eating that avocado,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're also having like a giant orgy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're going to leave behind a ton
of cocoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one of those cocoons are anywhere
from like one to 20 worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have like these huge
populations booms, huge baby booms after
[SPEAKER_02]: you have, after you do something like the
avocado tech or you attract them all up to
[SPEAKER_02]: a common area and you feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also it's popular to kind of amend
that avocado lightly with some amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they're taking those
amendments as well as all the fat and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the good stuff in the avocado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they go back and they
disperse throughout the soil, then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: pooping out all that good stuff all
throughout their reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's a great way to amend your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without tilling it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talked about the worms ability to
transport nutrients, I was thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, in my head, it was always just the
mycelial networks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, this is an entirely different and
I would probably say more mechanical way
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're eating the food scraps and
then they grab some of the amendment and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they bust out and go to another
neighborhood in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking all of that with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea how much, like I'm imagining
taking like a melon or a squash like you
[SPEAKER_00]: example, like you suggested, and adding a
little bit of amendment to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to just add the amount like as
if we were adding salt to eat it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we actually add it pretty heavily?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely go light on any
amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if your soil is thriving,
you might not even need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it, it's always kind of tough
blindly amending things without looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you just add a little bit of
something, a lot of times just some trace
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals or something like that is all you
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I usually go light on any dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly just rely on heavy mulching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to supply the fertility
that I need in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks like me who are not going to be
able to not do this because it's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any amendments, like
specifically dry amendments that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: not use because worms do not like them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly nothing significant or else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing straight comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want something incredibly
abrasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like rubbing against,
you know, diatomaceous earth, which I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, even like a insect frass might,
you know, have that harsh, tiny little
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that can cut them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do add some dry amendments,
just, you know, go ahead and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: guacamole out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just have the dry amendments there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that guacamole idea is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're using melon or squash,
you know, like make that slurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to say if you're using a
melon, don't use the whole entire fleshy
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use mainly the rind.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add too much of that fruitiness,
you're going to attract some fruit flies
[SPEAKER_02]: and excess juice and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use some of the red melon part,
but mainly stick to using the rind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect use for your leftover
melon rinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about like putting them
in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I am in the garden and I see a
worm that's at the surface, just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cruising around the garden, I generally
pick them up and I toss them in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I'm doing that, I recognize that
over time they will procreate and there'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when a lot of people are first
starting their pots, we all know how
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive people want to be with their
first year pots trying to make them be
[SPEAKER_00]: wildly biologically active in the short
summer run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that my pots really got good after
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that first year, everybody's trying to
turn their often bagged soil into this
[SPEAKER_00]: super living soil in one run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure that there are other
people who have been tempted like I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to either get worms from a friend or buy
them online or wild craft them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I actually hadn't considered until
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is to get a bunch and put
like a whole handful in one container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can there be too many worms per pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're really good at controlling
their population and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to reproduce if there's not
enough food for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, if we're trying to do
no till in a 30 gallon pot or a smallish
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, like that, you don't want to toss in
handfuls of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to stick to maybe five,
10 worms at first and they'll absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: aerate it and start to reproduce and
control their numbers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is with no till long term
is it just turns into a bed full of
[SPEAKER_02]: castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't have enough long term
aeration sources, everything in there is
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to turn into worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you don't really want to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we saying that's good or are we saying
that's bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the soil out of balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll lead to compaction over time and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you really need that aeration long
term in these raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so something that I do is I add some
aeration sources in between and just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of let it settle in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we sell what we call vermi mulch at
Wermie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's our thicker grade of the compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a ton of tiny little wood
chips and like your eggshells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a ton of cocoons in there and
worms and so many rove beetles,
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial mites and predators and
shredders of all sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those wood chips are going to
settle down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll add some crushed lava rock
or pumice every now and then and just let
[SPEAKER_02]: that continue to settle in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of it only being worm castings and
then only feeding it organic matter on top
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to turn into worm castings as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like it's very important
to consider, especially if you are a long
[SPEAKER_00]: term food or cannabis cultivator and
you're doing no till minded stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of there being potentially too
much density of worm castings never
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in addition to my regular soil
amendments, the idea of adding small wood
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmentations and things like that to the
top and just letting it settle in sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly that's going to be awesome for
your lower levels of the food web as well
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's going to be all these like
little surface areas for those little
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only going to be adding five or
10 for a 30 gallon pot and then let them
[SPEAKER_00]: do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to also feed them in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that they won't have more
babies if there's not enough food sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: but could the 10 eat everything in the pot
and then crash in it where I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about putting food scraps on the
surface of the container as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe it's putting in some scraps
and then covering it with compost so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not open to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the general idea of the question is
should I be thinking about feeding them in
[SPEAKER_00]: my container at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you're a fan of cover
cropping or mulching adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't add any food scraps necessarily,
but always chopping and dropping a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops and pruning any of my ganja
leaves, tossing them in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're taken care of within a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of hungry things in
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pill bugs will take care of some
leaves for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, always feeding the soil with that
mulch layer, keeping it protected and
[SPEAKER_02]: letting the worms come up to the top to
eat that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like we talked about earlier,
we don't want a whole lot of exposed soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the worms to ever see or
grow late necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to stay in the moist,
dark environment with the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that I fill a container with
sifted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's no worms in it because
I just sifted every square centimeter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mid-season, I see worms in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand intellectually that that
happened because there were worm cocoons
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there any way to know how dense
soil is with cocoons already when you use
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you just have to let it ride?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think I've ever even seen
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what one looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so once you know what they look
like, they're a lot easier to spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're little orange, goldish little
orbs, probably a millimeter or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can take up a scoop of pretty much
any handful of our compost piles at
[SPEAKER_02]: Wormies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to find at least one
cocoon in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you get the eye for it,
you'll be able to see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, it's still way easier
to let that go through your sifter
[SPEAKER_02]: unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't worry too much about the
population of worms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that there's some in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep them fed with the organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I add that air ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've spoke earlier about how we don't
want our worm bins to get too hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'll address again in third set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinking about the containers,
I intentionally am trying to have my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and the containers warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The container warm so that the microbes
are happy and aggressively living,
[SPEAKER_00]: shall I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants, of course,
I want them to be transpiring and
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively living as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much risk am I looking at having my
containers out in full summer sunshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the pot naturally keep the worms cool
enough that they won't melt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I need to be aware of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a very important thing to
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like using black pots outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the tan fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps the soil a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, really focusing on that thick
mulch layer is going to do a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect all your microbes and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your macro invertebrates and worms and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you definitely don't want them
to cook in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have that pot right on the
ground, or if there's any holes in there
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, worms are really smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll see if you were to put worms
in a thermophilic hot compost pile,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to go right to the core.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to go to the hot part.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get the hell out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to get away from the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if there's another option for them
to get out, and that might just be them
[SPEAKER_02]: going up to the top and hanging out
underneath that moist mulch, or all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way down to the bottom where it's still
moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to find something around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you definitely don't just want a
black pot out in the open sun with no
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch, no shade, or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always got to be mindful of what the
soil wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And think, how are they going to prefer
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a big thing, realizing
that I was more of a microbe farmer than a
[SPEAKER_02]: worm farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm creating the perfect environments for
these microbes to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that, the worms follow,
and all the good stuff follows.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need the environment that's
conducive for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what starts it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's finish this set with what I'm
guessing is a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been told this since childhood,
and I'm probably not the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might as well address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a worm and we cut it in half,
do we then have two worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any reason we should be doing
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, definitely do not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms are living.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sentient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, they don't regenerate into two
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is true that if you cut it at a certain
point, and somebody's actually figured
[SPEAKER_02]: this out, there's a number of segments
that you can go to or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that tail will regenerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one worm will be fine, but the other
part will die off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you're not going to regenerate two
worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if one does get cut, there is a good
chance that it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll regenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one gets cut, toss it back in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be doing it of your own accord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are dispelling that myth right here and
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the biggest predators of
worms is humans, or maybe not predators,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with rototilling and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we come in and we just slice these
worms up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're using salts,
you're literally tossing salt on the
[SPEAKER_02]: wound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's terrible what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is regenerative farming
educator, Chandler Michelski.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fully functioning greenhouse grows
extraordinary cannabis flowers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal, great terpene
profiles, and exceptional yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we have discussed many times on
Shaping Fire, a greenhouse is only as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as the environment you create for the
plants inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm has been on the forefront of
developing and installing highly efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse solutions since 1980.

[SPEAKER_00]: climate solutions are tailored to each
grower's specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have root zone heating mats that
attach to a home hot water heater for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing areas 500 square feet or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere of the growing environment
directly affects the health and
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm offers heating, cooling,
dehumidification, and CO2 enrichment to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the air your plants breathe and
optimize plant growth by enhancing the

[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about water conservation
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use,
and pit moss is inert, so it won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient-enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is regenerative farming educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: channel number Michalski.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking all
about worms, the good they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and why we love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no doubt, while their just very
existence in our garden is good for pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much everybody involved, we do tend to
focus on their castings because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you have castings, what's the
best thing to do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they kind of seem like a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them for every thing,
and I'm here to tell you the answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go through some of the
ways that Chandler uses them in his
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, and maybe some of them will be
attractive to you, dear listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first way that many people get into
worm castings is simply by adding it to
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they're going to start out their
pots with, they will have some variable
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of it that is locally purchased or
gifted worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you speak to that, give us an idea
of maybe how we should choose our
[SPEAKER_00]: castings, and then how much to put in the
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's what got me into this
whole world, is me starting to try to mix
[SPEAKER_02]: my own soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found Subcool's super soil recipe,
and reading the forums, realized that the
[SPEAKER_02]: compost was the most important part,
and that's why you can have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe all over the country, but
everybody's going to have different
[SPEAKER_02]: results because they're all using
different compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sent me down the rabbit hole of,
okay, well, what's the best compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: And quickly found out that worms produce
the best compost, or some of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: compost, and it's pretty easy to do it at
home in a home worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started doing that, and I realized
pretty quickly that I was eating garbage
[SPEAKER_02]: and I couldn't put anything beneficial
into my worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You yourself were eating garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was a busy college student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't put your food scraps in
because the worms are like, screw you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, there's just not enough
fruits and veggies, not enough cooking for
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a big red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, holy shit, that's not how we
should be doing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to start taking better care of
myself and cooking at home more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quickly started to accumulate more
fruit and veggie scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feeding my worms really, really good
stuff and getting the best compost
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I was just starting to learn
how to mix my own soil, how to grow my own
[SPEAKER_02]: ganja, and came into this world of worm
castings and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then- Hold on, before you move on,
I think we need to recognize for a second
[SPEAKER_00]: there how naturally romantic that is that
you get into building soil to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and then the worms support you in
eating a healthier diet because you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed them a better diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better support for eating healthy
than even my friends give me because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated to help the worms because I want
them to help me with the ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that that is a beautiful
example about how regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_00]: really closes circles and offers
unexpected positive results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lifestyle for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super grateful to have found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much should we put into our soil
recipes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we shoot for 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want like 15 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been studies on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show that that amount greatly
improves yield and all that good stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: decreases pest and pathogen pressure,
but anything over 20% and it might be kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you really overdo it,
then you can run into the compaction
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and all that stuff like we were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, 15 to 20% if you're mixing
your own soil, but then also really like
[SPEAKER_02]: top dressing it through out the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll just literally take a handful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not big on measuring or anything and,
you know, spread that around the base of
[SPEAKER_02]: each plant and water it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe every other week or so if you ever
notice, you know, plants could use a
[SPEAKER_02]: little boost or something, maybe give them
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't stick to any strict
cycles or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know pretty much if I ever see a
problem, I'll just top dress some castings
[SPEAKER_02]: and then brew a compost tea and the
problems are resolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are top dressing worm castings,
do you normally put down the worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: and then either add an extra layer of soil
or compost or scratch the surface and work
[SPEAKER_00]: it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the top dressed amendments,
you kind of need to keep them moist for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to break down and do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that also true with worm castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine that a dry worm casting is
as effective as a moist one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'll scratch it in a little bit,
but then the watering in after you spread
[SPEAKER_02]: it pretty thin, will take a lot of that
and bring it, pull it down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you top dress additional?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's assume you have a new pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are using your 20% castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you expect that to last the entire
cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you still perhaps start top
dressing more like maybe when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: flower cycle or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I usually at least do another top
dress right as I flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it also depends on how much you
have and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, generally, like I said,
I don't stick to schedules, but I'll do at
[SPEAKER_02]: least one top dress during veg and then a
nice big top dress and chop and drop when
[SPEAKER_02]: I flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that chop and drop is kind of what
I use to cover up the castings instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: additional soil or compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll lay down the castings, kind of
scratch it in, water it in, and then chop
[SPEAKER_02]: and drop all my cover crop and print some
leaves and then cover that up and keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: moist and protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other time that it's very popular
to top dress is actually between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're indoors or if it's the off
season, we're all generally adding
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments to the soil preparing for the
next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are outdoors, it's a little less
obvious as it is with indoors when to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that it is October and
everything is cut and hung.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at all the stocks that are
coming out of my containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be more likely to amend then and
let it sit over the winter season that
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you actually wait and amend in
April or May in the spring after the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always want to be building up that
fertility and it's super important,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially for getting snow in the winter
to really build a thick, thick mulch layer
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some cover crop seeds underneath it
and you'll actually have some cold
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have living plants underneath that
thick mulch layer and they're still
[SPEAKER_02]: pumping exudates into the soil and keeping
everything alive all winter long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have that, if you have
bare soil, it's all going to freeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to have to
re-inoculate and kind of start over in the
[SPEAKER_02]: springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to be mulching all year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: But putting our beds to sleep properly in
the wintertime is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never come up on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just considered that during the
winter, the containers got so cold that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the microphones, all the microbes
sisted up and essentially went into
[SPEAKER_00]: hibernation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this idea that there's still life
happening in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to make sure we have a good
mulch layer to kind of give it a winter
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket and then castings and other
nutritive amendments just to help keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: logs burning over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really interesting idea that I
hadn't really engaged with before.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I used to definitely subscribe to
that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure that everything sisted up,
went dormant for the winter and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: it would come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But putting cover crop in my pots and a
thick mulch layer, I've got to post on my
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram actually some hairy vetch just
thriving in early February.
[SPEAKER_02]: That made me realize there is still some
sunlight getting through that mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to still be pumping some carbon
into the soil, some exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for the most part things are quite
slowed down and dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really protecting it and doing all
that stuff will just make everything
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive in the spring when it does thaw and
come back to life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that hairy vetch that was doing its
thing all winter long, it was the second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it started going to flower as
soon as spring came and it attracted so
[SPEAKER_02]: many pollinators and your beneficial
predators and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to our next application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already talked about as a soil
amendment in your initial container
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked about top amending both
during the cycle and during the off
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about adding it to compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's assume for the moment we're
talking about an aerated tea made in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the popular ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to incorporate castings,
do we want to add it to the brewer or is
[SPEAKER_00]: it something we add to the add to it after
we've pulled from the brewer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to use a compost tea bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I put all the compost inside of
that mesh bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll put that inside of the
brewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, agitate it really massage it
get all those microbes suspended and in
[SPEAKER_02]: the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll brew it depending on the
recipe and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm definitely still experimenting
with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of tough to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without looking under the scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically I've never brewed a compost
tea using good compost that has had
[SPEAKER_02]: detrimental results, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like I think the microscope stuff
is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have it and you have time to
get into it, there's a lot to learn from
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, you know, brewing a compost
tea, sticking to the rules, sticking to
[SPEAKER_02]: your intuition, you're going to have
really good stuff if you're using good
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of got distracted from the question
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll take it to the next part of the
question then which is, so we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about aerated compost teas and you said,
okay, we're going to put it in a bag so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the compost is not actually in the
brewer causing a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing then that the next,
you know, if you're using a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not talking about an aerated
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about like we make tea,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like tea to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got water and then you put a bag of
stuff in it and it just soaks the tea out,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm pretty new to that kind of a
compost extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm finding that I really like it
because it's so easy and so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would it be simply you've got your
bag of compost in the bucket and then next
[SPEAKER_00]: to it you're going to have a bag of
castings or if you've got a big enough
[SPEAKER_00]: bag, you can put them both in the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moral of the story is that it works
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only use castings in a compost tea
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use a separate compost source
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'll like add in some leaf
litter from the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I say compost tea, I'm pretty
much talking just a casting tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's complete?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you really think that there's not
really anything added by adding compost
[SPEAKER_00]: from your compost pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's all there with the worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're clearly like think way too
much about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a reason why you don't
bother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use the vermi mulch more than the
castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is, you know, it's something
local to wormies and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't familiar with it, but it's just the
coarser sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's still got all the worm
castings, but it's got all the wood chips
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like our worm rows are fed
thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's already gone through the
hot composting process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so you have all that diversity
and then the worms are working through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we add all these mushroom blocks
and bokashi compost and fermented tea and
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit from kombucha places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like we re-inoculate the hot
compost with as much diversity as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let the worms work through it for like
10 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not using just like regular
pedestrian castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using like Olympic level castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that is easy to
forget when we're talking about this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like not everybody has access to
wormies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about maybe just using
worm castings from your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, yeah, if that's the case,
you might want to go ahead and add some
[SPEAKER_02]: compost from your outdoor source as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just maximize that diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the vermi mulch from wormies is
complete for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people, more people
than we probably even think about who are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in urban situations, the castings
they're using, they're just like straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up buying online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're stripped down, like nutritive,
but kind of like boring and maybe not,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, clearly not as complex as what
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those people, I think that it
would make sense to back up their castings
[SPEAKER_00]: with a biologically active mulch as well
or compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the ways to apply
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like most nutrition, I would think that
it's beneficial to both pour the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea directly into the container or bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also there is a foliar option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true that really we can do both?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the difference between the tea and
the extract is you're aerating the tea and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding a food source for those
microbes to proliferate and expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the extract, you're just extracting
what's available in the compost and
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it into a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not actually giving it an air
source and a food source to increase its
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, but you're just taking the
microbes that are there, putting it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, and then you can water your
plants with that or you can spray your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the benefits of a compost tea
is the foliar application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the glomulin, the glue-like
substance that a lot of these bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: produce, is going to make it a whole lot
stickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you spray an actively aerated
compost tea, it's going to have more of
[SPEAKER_02]: that glomulin and more of that stickiness
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to stick to your
leaves longer than a compost extract
[SPEAKER_02]: would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you only have time for a compost
extract, if you don't want to clean your
[SPEAKER_02]: brewer or whatever, it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to use maybe a couple cups for
a couple gallons in your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in your extract, you're going to want
to use a whole lot more compost than you
[SPEAKER_02]: would in a tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you want to really fill up your
mesh bag or whatever and massage that
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use more compost in an extract than you
would in a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when using foliar, I got to admit that
I've never done in castings foliar because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hesitant because I know that it's air
quotes poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we normally want to keep manure off of
the tops of the plants because of things
[SPEAKER_00]: like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need to be concerned about spraying
worm waste on the tops of the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get into this tough area of
generalizing all castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are totally different from different
sources and different parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, different feedstocks,
different environments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be comparing apples and oranges,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have a compost that isn't
complete, and they were using some animal
[SPEAKER_02]: manure and stuff like that, you're going
to maybe run into more problems than
[SPEAKER_02]: compost that you fully trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have never run into any issues with
using a good compost and spraying it
[SPEAKER_02]: directly on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, I don't spray any
compost teas or manures or anything in
[SPEAKER_02]: flour at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like if you're going to
foliar, you don't want to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: castings right out of your bin and use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you take them out of
the bin and then compost them so they
[SPEAKER_00]: become a finished, balanced compost
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the aging process is really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we think, OK, all the food scraps
are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This compost is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to actually let that
compost sit there for six months and just
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it moist, you let it cure up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you let all those mesophilic microbes
work through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though you can't necessarily see
a whole lot of change, they're doing their
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're continuing to cure it up into
waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good way to do a better
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, ah, this is vintage worm compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is aged.
[SPEAKER_02]: From free range worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another issue with foliar with
amendments is sometimes the nozzles get
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are going to run a casting tea,
we probably should run it through some
[SPEAKER_00]: filters to get out any loose bits,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't clog up the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend to put it through
more than cheesecloth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that eight thick cheesecloth going
to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some cheesecloth folded over itself
is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, the compost tea bags that
you brew right in are usually good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really important to clean out
both your brewer and your sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything right after to prevent
biofilm from accumulating and dry in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a whole lot harder to clean
once it's dry and all those nooks and
[SPEAKER_02]: crannies than if you were to just pump
some water and maybe some Dr. Browners
[SPEAKER_02]: through it right away or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any are the are the organism,
the target organisms that we're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of the castings tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be susceptible to damage
from high pressure foliar sprayers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just learning about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know a ton about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but there's certainly a you know,
a higher end foliar sprayer that can
[SPEAKER_00]: really wreak havoc on microbes if it's
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you probably know what I'm
talking about more than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, definitely something to look into.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever buy like a pack of nematodes,
they'll say it's like don't exceed 72 psi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that your nozzles over like
point eight millimeters in diameter or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, I talked to the bug
lady, Suzanne Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, oh, yes, it's definitely not
that strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some more leeway there,
but you definitely don't want crazy high
[SPEAKER_02]: pressurization and you don't want like
micronization or whatever, because it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just shred up like the nematodes and some
of like the larger stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacteria will still get through,
but it lowers the efficacy of like what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be surviving once it hits the
leaf, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we use Grow King, a garden
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's other options out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to give advertisement or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is this gun that Luis,
the owner of Wormies, was recommended
[SPEAKER_02]: through the Soil Food Web Academy and Dr.
Elaine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the name of the gun, but there's
definitely some stuff out there that is
[SPEAKER_02]: proven to work for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to a question that I
missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of folks who do not live
rurally, they are buying their inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at stores and stuff,
because they're not able to wildcraft it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we learn over time that,
for example, you don't want to be buying
[SPEAKER_00]: compost in bags that smells like bleach,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just different, there's different,
you know, you want fresh, fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we should be
looking for when buying bagged castings
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want to avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any clear signs of like spoiled
castings?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I definitely don't recommend
buying castings that have been sitting on
[SPEAKER_02]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know sometimes that's your only option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that point, it's, I don't know,
it's more like a place filler than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, you know, like compost should
really be a microbial inoculation more
[SPEAKER_02]: than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yes, it's going to provide some
nutrients, but it's really providing the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that your soil needs to take care
of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so like, that's what's great
about wormies is you can come,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, get it straight from the farm,
never put it into a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or when we do bag it, it's usually gone
within that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like nothing dries out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't go dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in breathable bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like highly, highly recommend,
you know, finding somebody that's
[SPEAKER_02]: composting around you or doing it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the stuff that you get from the
grow store that's sitting in a bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: who knows how long it's been there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows the feedstock that they fed that
stuff with?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have just been, you know,
newspaper and cardboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you get a homogenous product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks the same every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some growers are used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, what benefit is that actually
adding?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, it's really nothing compared
to living, breathing microbes from fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: compost, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who aren't sure where you
would get it, because you live in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city, I would recommend also checking your
farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very happy to find that this year,
our farmers markets just started back up
[SPEAKER_00]: here on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite organic food
purveyors, they've got castings there at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of their table now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get five pounds for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's double great because they're
local, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all imbued with our local
island IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will probably buy them out for the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you got the hook up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the thing too, is like a lot
of people don't necessarily advertise
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a vermicomposting
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some heady people out there
for sure that, you know, might have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the power of community
and, you know, getting out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: connecting with these cool people because
there are really, really cool people,
[SPEAKER_02]: like-minded, cool, like-minded people out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times we're just spread
pretty far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bringing us together in the community
and stuff is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we'll talk about the compost cup
later, but it's so important to network
[SPEAKER_02]: and find these cool people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's finish up this set with talking
about natural farming ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much everybody who is going to
be using the castings from the show is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be using natural farming preps or
KNF preps specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that there are some people
who are thinking to themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, will any of my preparations hurt
the worms or not play nice with the
[SPEAKER_00]: castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming since they're all in the
same food web, we're good, but we should
[SPEAKER_00]: really address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you speak a little to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to overdo anything like
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, I don't know, I use some KNF
preps, I use some JDOM, use, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of everything that resonates
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mainly just focus on, you know,
mulching heavily, inoculating with as much
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity as possible and just like taking
care of the soil and letting the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like strategically, you don't use as
many inoculants as others would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically to the question,
these natural ferments, so long as you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, use as directed, like,
you know, 1,500, 1,000, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're using them at the proper
strength, they're not going to mess with
[SPEAKER_00]: the worms, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that level, it's like homeopathic
almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like less is more and a lot of the
situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people get into this KNF
stuff, and they're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this says 1 to 1,000, you know,
let's do 1 to 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's double it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because that's a very American way of
thinking, you know, I, dude, I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to cop to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to constantly not add more of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like, oh, if 1 to 1,000 is
great, 1 to 200 must be five times as
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's working against nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or like just spraying FPGA or
fermented fruit juice or something without
[SPEAKER_02]: balancing it out first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, there's a whole lot to these
schools of thoughts that you kind of got
[SPEAKER_02]: to know pretty much all of it to
understand why it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, when you just hear one thing
and yeah, you go for that, it might not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily be the whole picture and you
could mess something up and then say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, well, KNF doesn't work or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's classic bro science right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the reasons why I'm not
that great of a baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm a killer cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do magic in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but with baking, it's not about iron
chefing until you're already like really
[SPEAKER_00]: good at baking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first start baking, you have to
follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I seem to have like a total
inability to follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I generally buy or trade for
my breads because, you know, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wish that it was like,
you know, in The Matrix, when he plugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the program, he's like, I know Kung Fu,
you know, I just wish I could plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: baking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because because a good baker, it takes
some dedication and development of skills
[SPEAKER_00]: before you can kind of iron chef it like,
you know, and like, I'm at such a novice
[SPEAKER_00]: level with baking that it demands that I
measure everything, because I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: earned my right to eyeball things for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a lot of similarity with that
and composting or growing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, when you first start off,
yeah, you can find there's some pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: strict guidelines out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might want to stick to them at
first until like you have a baseline of
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding, you know, and then once you
understand, you know, why everything's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing what it's doing, like, then you can
start to experiment a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, for example, a lot of home worm
bin owners will like look up directions
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff and say, Oh, I absolutely can't
put any citrus in there, no onions,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, no, you know, there's there's
all sorts of rules out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, once you understand your worms
and your bin and everything, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, you can put maybe a little bit of
something like that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you don't want to fill up the
whole entire thing with any of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you want to understand like the
basic principles of like covering up your
[SPEAKER_02]: scraps and stuff like that to avoid
getting fruit for lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, once once you stick to the
baselines for a little bit, and then get
[SPEAKER_02]: some understanding, then you can go off on
your own and start to experiment a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit and do some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's go ahead and take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is regenerative farming
educator Chandler Michelle ski.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_00]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been worked enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each phenom in the pack really
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: gnome automatics became a trusted and
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years as Mandalorian genetics and recently
changed their name to gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that has changed is the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_00]: the website too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_00]: merch section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want reliable seeds, hand-built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, choose gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_00]: other psychedelics and it's a very strange
time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014 and as the
[SPEAKER_00]: market has diversified into psilocybin and
other plant medicines, Green Light has
[SPEAKER_00]: been right there evolving with their
diverse clients to provide legal expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high level of legal acumen,
creative strategy and precision that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_00]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner or simply because you want to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their work
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Green Light Law Group today and
learn more about the services they can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer your industry leading cannabis or
psychedelics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Green Light Law Group at

[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky cards and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.

a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is regenerative farming educator
[SPEAKER_00]: Chandler Michalski.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked about
the greatness and epic nature of the worm
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we can work well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we talked about how
to use the castings and various
[SPEAKER_00]: applications in our garden so that we can
get that nutrition into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people will just stop there and
be thrilled because they will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: source for the castings either from a
local organic farmer or they'll find some
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy hippies selling them online that
they'll become friends with or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can get them as a gift from
somebody locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for many of us, especially if you have
got a large cultivation situation going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you're probably already thinking about
setting up a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all like, I need to produce this
black gold on my own property and then
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate it with your own IMO that you
produced on your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And set three is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no doubt that an entire show
could easily be done just on best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for making a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is for people who are considering
making a worm bin to, at the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: set, you will have a better understanding
of what it will require.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll probably have enough basic
information to go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we just kind of want to give
you a taste of what the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can either A, decide if you want to
do it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, people like us when we get
around for dinner parties, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff we talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your next farmer dinner party,
if they're talking about worm bins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll know what the hell is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take this information as you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we understand it's not going to be a
complete set of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Chandler, back to the worm
species discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about the worms in the
soil, just cruising around being worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: there seems to be a lot of variety of the
kinds of worms that we can just toss into
[SPEAKER_00]: the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same when setting up a bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the bin more related to using one
particular species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use night crawlers in these
bins, but I don't really like doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to go down deep, up to 12,
15 feet deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they obviously can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: into a bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd much rather use the red wigglers
who only stick to that top six to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: inches, which is pretty much all that
you're going for in a worm bin anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for enclosed worm bins,
I think red wigglers are probably the way
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a particular place that one
sources those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you know somebody with a worm
bin, what, if they give you a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: cupped hands full, is that going to be
enough to start your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you need a bunch where you need to
order them from a worm bin starter company
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, popular weight to sell them in is in
half pounds or pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a pound is usually considered like
1000 worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a great way to start a worm
bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will regulate their population
and stuff based off of what you're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a pound of worms is usually the ideal
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to have a worm bin,
and we want to be producing enough
[SPEAKER_00]: castings for our own cultivation needs for
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if somebody is thinking about selling
these, there are whole different sources
[SPEAKER_00]: about scaling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what we're talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how big of a bin am I likely to want
if I am a, like just a home grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, yeah, I know this is not a
legal number, but let's just say under 20
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're a home grower under 20
plants versus somebody who's more
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scaled where you're talking
like 100 and above, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the differences in sizes so
that we can wrap our heads around that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be tough to supply 100
plants all year if you're doing indoor and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot, unless you have a pretty big
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one of the biggest things
with worm bins is a lot of people get one
[SPEAKER_02]: to try to compost all of their food scraps
or all of their garden waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to pack it full.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to overfeed your worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ideally, most people should have a
regular compost pile out in their backyard
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they can take just the best
organic food that they have or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the highest quality stuff,
put that in the worm bin, and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: can put the rest out into the actual
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can mix the final products or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be a lot better for
these large scale to have enough compost
[SPEAKER_02]: without being full-time worm farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the physical size of a worm bin,
like two by three?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty common to use your Rubbermaid totes
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great DIY solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you can use a little two by three
tote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything similar to that size.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some popular worm towers are out
there, and those are only maybe two by
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally like the continual
flow-through systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The urban worm bag is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just constantly put your scraps on
top, and all the castings are on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can actually harvest from the
bottom there, separate your worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds super convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pros and cons to different at-home
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think understanding that you're
probably not going to be able to compost
[SPEAKER_02]: all of your waste through your worm bin is
an important realization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you can't really go wrong
either too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just a cold compost pile outside,
as well as a dedicated worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like you can really go
wrong either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not you use the bag,
or you build a fancy wooden box,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you use a plastic tub, your setup costs
are really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just get something and start with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you get more sophisticated,
you'll learn more what you want for your
[SPEAKER_00]: next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be intimidated with any of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with what you have and make the best
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over time, you can upgrade and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think, oh, I just got to
wait until I have everything I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is true about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of things in this
gardening and composting that you really
[SPEAKER_02]: can just connect some food with the ground
outside or whatever and stuff starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us probably have those black and
yellow bins on the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that the location of the bin on
the property is important because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like when you inoculate wood chips
and you're going to grow mushrooms on your
[SPEAKER_00]: property, you're kind of looking at the
edge of the property near the trees where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the same kind of place where we're
going to want to put the worm bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're probably all going to want
to put it on our deck right next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can imagine that might not be the
best place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it might be convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you definitely want to keep it
out of direct sunlight and keep it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture and the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got a tree line, keep it just to
the north of the trees on the south side
[SPEAKER_02]: of your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it nice in the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just going to help out everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have to add water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really beneficial to pour water
over your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never want excess water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how this became such a common
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people think that a healthy worm bin
should have leachate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have excess water coming out of
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's really not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a lot of excess water coming
out, you're probably doing something
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, moisture is
absolutely vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to remember you're creating the
environment for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need that bit of biofilm to swim
around in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They move around a whole lot faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can set up their colonies and
everything if there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really want to maintain the
moisture of your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it dries out at all, the microbes are
going to cyst up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the conditions are right,
again, they're not all going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to lose some
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we said, it's a time-consuming
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't put all your scraps in there
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really want to be speeding up
the process as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can feed your worms as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a great way to do that is by
reducing the particle size of your
[SPEAKER_02]: feedstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more surface area you have,
the more inoculation points for all your
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's going to be a lot easier for
your microbes to get in and soften things
[SPEAKER_02]: up, break things down, and then your worms
to come in and eat those microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blending your food scraps is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll save so much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this is for that next level
soil nerd who's like, OK, I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_02]: all my vegetable scraps into the food
processor before I put them in my worm
[SPEAKER_02]: bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a whole other intentional thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll really decrease the amount of
time it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like a best practice
that you might not have to start with that
[SPEAKER_00]: day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll find a huge increase in benefit
from that small action.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And freezing them too is another popular
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're only one person or a small
family, you can accumulate your food
[SPEAKER_02]: scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any extra freezer space,
put them in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that freezing and thawing will
actually break down the cell wall and let
[SPEAKER_02]: those microbes get in there a whole lot
faster and speed everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a common question for
wintertime up here in Michigan in these
[SPEAKER_02]: cold areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, can I still compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yes, you should still
accumulate your scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not going to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they're going to freeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're just sitting there and
waiting for the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll all be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's a great location to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you first get your bin,
what do you want to put in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally food scraps, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've just started my bin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you suggest that we save our food
scraps for a week or two before we get our
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on the worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also see a lot of people that have
got newspaper in their bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like training wheels for a worm
bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Break this down for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so newspaper is good if you don't
have compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd much rather my worms just be in
compost and eating all those microbes than
[SPEAKER_02]: in newspaper or shredded paper or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have access to a ton of newspaper,
which I don't even know who does anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where they're printing paper
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shred that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the worms love that as a bedding,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I highly recommend using some compost
in your bin and then adding your food
[SPEAKER_02]: scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like any compost or any organic
matter, there's a carbon to nitrogen ratio
[SPEAKER_02]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you don't want all your nitrogen
rich food scraps just sitting on your bin
[SPEAKER_02]: and becoming the sloppy wet mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to balance that out with
the dry carbon rich brown material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like shred it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cardboard is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shredded paper is a part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think using compost that has wood
chips and all your twigs and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you're going to get so much more
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, a lot of people think,
OK, I got this worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be a monoculture of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's really not the most healthy
worm bin either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have all sorts of soil mites in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predators and shredders and quality stuff,
you'll get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rove beetles come in and pill bugs and all
sorts of diversity that a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're just beginning, it might freak
them out because they're just expecting to
[SPEAKER_02]: see worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those other guys are very,
very helpful, very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking to start or inoculate a
bin, would it be reasonable just to take
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our containers from last year and
dump that in the bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that it's living soil
that's super biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: How high on the bin or container do we
want to put compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen many people's bins that look
kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only this one or two inches of
paper and old melons and stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that does not, that looks
kind of sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my head, I picture a plastic bin
that's a third or halfway full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I get the melon rind or
whatever, I'll pull some of the soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: the side, put the melon, and then cover it
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm making this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, if you're using these red
wigglers, they're not going to really like
[SPEAKER_02]: anything deeper than eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to be probably about
as high as you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it depends on how often you need to
harvest your castings or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could just let it all turn to
castings on the bottom and continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed on top and fill up the whole entire
bin and harvest it way down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you need those castings right away,
then you might not want to continue to add
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next part is the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we, like in my head,
the worms are cruising around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and they're leaving castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the castings are mixed in with the
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I going to harvest the entire bin
and then start it again like I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: with a compost brewer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where multiple bins comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over time, you'd stop feeding your
one bin fresh scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you have the vertically integrated
system, you'd start feeding that top one
[SPEAKER_02]: the fresh scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all the worms on the bottom bin
would go up through those holes in that
[SPEAKER_02]: top bin and they'd find the fresh scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in theory, all the bottom bin
would be void of worms or most of them
[SPEAKER_02]: would be on the top bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, different ways to do it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool and novel, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm realizing that there is a whole new
world that I'm about to be turned on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fact that people are stacking
bins and putting holes in one so the worms
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally migrate, I mean, that's just
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find a couple of different
models like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the worm tower or worm factory 360
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just basically a worm tower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really you only need two bins that
stack on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find some models that have like
five and it's like, yeah, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it gives you more options,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really only need two, one to kind of
let it cure up and then one to start
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those worms would migrate up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're just gonna sift them,
you can peel them out by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, like we're talking about
earlier, the avocado tech or any method to
[SPEAKER_02]: lure those worms up, you put a fresh piece
of pumpkin on there and damn near all the
[SPEAKER_02]: worms in your bin are gonna be up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could just scoop them out in
a handful or two and move them where they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great harvesting method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a particular website or a
forum for people who like me are now all
[SPEAKER_00]: jazzed about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched before we talked and there is
lots of information all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we know about cannabis,
your mileage may vary on the quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a place that you recommend that
people go to learn more if they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: all jazzed by this worm bin idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhonda Sherman is one of the leaders in
vermicomposting.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a true worm expert, vermicomposting
expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has this website here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bunch of random letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an educational one, but composting
.ces.ncsu.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole page on both home and
backyard composting, which are,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, home and bike yard as well as
large scale composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ton of information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the times it's hard to
differentiate, you know, if this knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: is for larger scale or if this is really
intended for your backyard, small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like this page has all that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to break down and navigate
through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So highly recommend looking at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like driving or something,
don't get into crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That link is going to be on the episode
page at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just go over there and click on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in wrapping up Chandler, you know,
one of the first things that I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: about this, well, actually the funny thing
is, is like, you told me that actually we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew about each other before I realized
that we knew about each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I thought I found out about you
first when I saw advertisements for last
[SPEAKER_00]: year's Michigan compost cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I went to email you to
invite you to be on the show, your email
[SPEAKER_00]: was, and you're like, oh no, man,
like I won a shaping fire contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I hadn't remembered that we
interacted and you got something from
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, like last year when you guys
did the compost cup in Michigan,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many people know, I'm from Michigan,
even though I live on Vashon Island in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, uh, that would be so great
to go, um, you know, back home for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so after that, I just kind of
liked, you know, everybody involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: the can, the compost cup, just so I could
see what cool stuff y'all were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I want to give you this opportunity
to plug the Michigan compost cup so that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the listeners in the Midwest,
like might want to go, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have some community and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so go ahead and plug before we wrap
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a, the gathering of the soil nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a celebration of soil and life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a wonderful, uh,
two and a half day event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have hands-on demos,
um, still figuring out what we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do this year, but probably going to be
building some Hugo cultures, doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar demos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, um, some question panels
and stuff like that, but really focusing
[SPEAKER_02]: on as much hands-on interactive stuff as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the best ganja in the state,
all the regenerative growers, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the, the best ferments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody ferments their own food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have educational panels
on, you know, how to ferment your own
[SPEAKER_02]: food, as well as the crossovers and like
how you can use that information to
[SPEAKER_02]: ferment your own, uh, inputs for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like just all this wonderful stuff,
connecting so many dots and honestly just
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrating being alive and listening to
music and just having fun under the full
[SPEAKER_02]: moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so highly, highly recommend you guys
come check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's September 9th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through 11th this year up in Northern
Michigan, uh, near Bel Air, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just 22 acre property, uh,
all the coolest soil nerds, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: great time.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that man, that sounds like
summer camp to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please come on out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I am actually very tempted,
so we'll have to continue that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chandler, thank you so much for,
uh, taking the time to share your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, this, you know, worms are
one of those things where we all know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're vital and we know we all try to
have worms in our cultivations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but I, you know, I'm probably not
the only one that really did not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with worms or like,
I really didn't know much, but after,
[SPEAKER_00]: after chatting with you, I feel a lot more
prepared to, you know, get into stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I bet I'm not the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you so much for sharing all
this experience and for the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the kind of evangelical,
the, the evangelist role that you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: play by encouraging people, because,
um, no doubt us getting into better
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with worms is going to put
us in better relationship with the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to help us regenerate our
earth and, um, not break it so quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, cyclical for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an absolute honor and pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: For having me.
Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, like, I want to follow along
with Chandler, there are three,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, key Instagram accounts that you're
going to want to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these links will be on the shaping
fire episode page for this show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, uh, jet house gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jet house gardens is Chandler's,
um, I would call this his personal page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's mostly cannabis cultivation and
lots of, uh, natural farming preps and
[SPEAKER_00]: places he goes is it's just naturally,
it just, it just cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like follow jet house gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, second is wormies GR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's W O W O R M I E S G R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is where, um, where Chandler
works as director of living soil and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, they essentially run a worm
casting and education and soil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, like pretty much everything
about, um, you know, worms essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, that, that is fun to follow
for education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but also it's, it's just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see applications and things that are
happening locally for them, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that they're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so wormies GR is cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, as Chandler already
plugged the Michigan compost cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, even if you are not, um, you know,
going to make the trip to Michigan,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not a Midwest person,
um, the Michigan compost cup Instagram is
[SPEAKER_00]: still fun to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not only do you get to, again,
more education, but, um, as they get more
[SPEAKER_00]: of their, uh, videos of speakers public,
um, you'll be able to access them and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get knowledge there.
