[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days of medical cannabis,
growers learned that a particular strain
[SPEAKER_01]: they grew had more of a medicinal value
than usual because of the feedback from
[SPEAKER_01]: the people who smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower would hear that it helped stop
someone's seizures, or it decreased pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe a Parkinson's patient's tremors
subsided for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: After enough comments like that,
a grower knew that this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: chemovar was one to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 2009, though, the first publicly
accessible cannabis analytics labs began
[SPEAKER_01]: to open, and cannabis producers could,
for the very first time ever, get reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific potency testing, and they
realized that many of these especially
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal strains contained cannabidiol,
more commonly known as CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is no federally allowed
cannabis market in the US, we now find
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves at a moment where CBD is sold
separately and differently in the four
[SPEAKER_01]: existing markets, of state-regulated
medical, state-regulated recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use, the unregulated market or black
market, and the international market for
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Production and distribution of CBD right
now is wild and volatile, and the markets
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to crash against each other as
price, availability, and quality between
[SPEAKER_01]: the different markets continues to shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone involved with cannabis business or
caring for patients will benefit from an
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of how these market
fluctuations will affect them.

[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth is a deinstitutionalized academic
with a master's in public policy and a PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: in sociology.
[SPEAKER_01]: His focus has been on the political
economy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years now, he's been consulted by
lawmakers and policy specialists for a
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding of how the
underground cannabis economy works.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's now co-founder of Oregon CBD,
a company researching, developing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and wholesaling high CBD cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk with Seth about
the past, present, and future of the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth, until the research on CBD began to
be more readily available in media
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, there really wasn't a CBD
market at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, through the efforts of hardcore
CBD evangelists like Martin Lee and Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo and Kevin Jodry and Lawrence
Ringo and lots of others, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: San Jay Gupta TV special, a profound
search for whole plant CBD is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hearts of patients everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you think that we first began
seeing something that we could call the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD market?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost look at it as something
that has organically emerged with the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of CBD-rich plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened in to the oral history with
Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal experience with the CBD market
started really with the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing that oral history was really
informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was neat to hear how it all ended up
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC in Oregon, where I'm at, really
became available after about 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it hit the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the same year that industrial
hemp production took off in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurred before the passage of the
2014 federal farm bill, which allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp production in the United
States to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following year, 2015, is when I would
say the CBD market really exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really took off, just in the sense of
product actually being available for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that plant availability seems to be
the big driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, as we've seen, as more people
get into the production side of CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price has gone down, and more and more
people are becoming exposed to it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense, too,
because it really is not the academic
[SPEAKER_01]: papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain degree, it's the media
attention, but the thing that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: driving the CBD market from what I've seen
is the fact that people are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting relief from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone will get relief, and then they'll
tell their sister, and their
[SPEAKER_01]: sister-in-law, and their uncle,
and their kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly, now you've got five more people
who are looking for CBD, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: tell someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that referral is the best
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people get relief, man, they want to
talk about cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it's non-psychological,
psychoactive, it's really a godsend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, for a lot of people who are
suffering, and find some relief from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's quite a few people,
even still in the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: community, who don't view CBD as something
other than a passing fad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They view it as snake oil, because maybe
they've tried it, and it didn't work for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the look on a child's face,
or on a grandparent's face, when they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of suffering relieved from it,
whether it's Dravet syndrome, and
[SPEAKER_00]: epileptic seizures in children,
or osteoarthritis from age, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term degeneration for the elder
members of our communities, it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It strikes a pretty powerful chord for
those of us that are participating in this
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally today, we're going to be
focusing mostly on cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_01]: or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is only one of over 100 cannabinoids
that are in whole plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move on, I just want you to
touch on other emerging markets for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people marketing CBN,
CBG, THCV for appetite suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing the market for other
cannabinoids other than cannabidiol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they all coming along as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about plant breeding,
at least the way that we've experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it takes about six months to develop a
new variety, and that's when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really making progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky enough now to have a lot of
analytical labs on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have PCR screens that we can use with
some folks that are putting that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: together for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emergence of new cannabinoids,
I think, is going to accelerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of them are not on the market at
this point, but they will be in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD was really the forerunner,
I think, on the non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really created a groundswell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of just having, as we were
talking about before, having people from a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of backgrounds and ages and life
experiences being more open and accepting
[SPEAKER_00]: of a compound that's coming from a
cannabis plant simply because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CBD has definitely paved the way
for future inroads in that department.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that Sanjay Gupta special on
television that focused on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wide-ranging uses of CBD, lots of folks
like the Stanley Brothers in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: renamed high CBD strange that they had
come across and began to market them
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found a really warm welcome by both
the media and patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge being, of course,
that the patients believed that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: only the Stanley Brothers' Charlotte's Web
that was the only strain that had health
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and that was certainly not the
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people fault the Stanley Brothers
for their approach, but it was really the
[SPEAKER_01]: media attention that they garnered that
helped explain the benefits of whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD to everybody and got it to reach
middle America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when my family back in the Midwest
started talking to me about it was after
[SPEAKER_01]: the summer Sanjay Gupta TV special.
[SPEAKER_01]: To what degree do you think that the heavy
media coverage has led to that fast rise
[SPEAKER_01]: in the popularity of CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could not be overstated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing with just about any type
of idea or product though.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it's picked up and moved into
popular consciousness either by media or
[SPEAKER_00]: today, active social networks on social
media, people moving ideas around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gains traction, it definitely
takes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some fascinating research that
looks at the popularity of specific songs
[SPEAKER_00]: and whether or not a popular tune will
catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's formulas for crafting music that
will sell millions and millions of records
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is probably true when it
comes to either cannabis varieties or any
[SPEAKER_00]: other idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just comes down to being able to get it
out into the marketplace and have people
[SPEAKER_00]: pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand where you're going with the
Stanley Brothers and Sanjay Gupta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely had a positive impact in
terms of being able to get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dangers with something like that when
you have one particular plant that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: identified as the be all and end all is
that you lose out on the amazing diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: that is actually present in the cannabis
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It confused a lot of people because even
though it was wonderful to have people
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about cannabis as a medicine,
there was also a handful of misinformation
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed in to the reporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now folks like you and I and our
contemporaries have to go and help people
[SPEAKER_01]: unlearn the first wave of information that
came out and help them fine tune it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that people can get the proper medicine
that's going to work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is true I would say on the
THC side as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go to a dispensary and they're
asking for something that's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them uplifted, that's going to have a
positive euphoric feeling for them or give
[SPEAKER_00]: them pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that they've been taught is
indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little bit more sophisticated version
is narrow leaf and broad leaf plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is you had Ethan Russo on a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's not just those things,
it's terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our breeding program we've noticed that
in open pollinated F2 generations we can
[SPEAKER_00]: find every combination of terpene and
plant shape imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a properly bred line you can find
anything in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different small things like that where the
folks who are learning and doing it by
[SPEAKER_00]: experience end up having to correct some
of that information as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also appreciate that you're plugging
some of my former shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already plugged two in our
interviews so I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the oral history of CBD with Kevin
Jodry and the two shows that I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: with Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you've had a chance to
listen to the show too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good people doing great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small community I think of
people who are really out on the forefront
[SPEAKER_00]: of this and need to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The misinformation about CBD that we were
talking about just a moment ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what has led us to a lot of
these CBD only medical marijuana laws at
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: These legislators who are pushing for CBD
only laws because they don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: involve the evil THC, they just are
missing the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand the importance of
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you really need all of the
different cannabinoids in the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the best medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondarily, a lot of people,
especially cancer patients and others,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the THC part of the plant that is
healing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, CBD is super healing and can be
used by every human because we all have
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, depending on what your issue
is, it may be the THC part of it that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of those legislators
miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the issues that I think is
probably contributing to that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: piecemeal approach from state to state
with different type of legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've seen is a lot of the more
conservative states, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: South, end up passing these CBD only laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say they're totally
misguided, but I think they're pushed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular way by people who have vested
interests in the production side and who
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to develop drugs that would fit
whatever laws they come up with in those
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain laws, they call them CBD
only laws, but you can have up to 5% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in your extracts and compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's not a CBD only law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be more like a one-to-one law,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, that's probably
one of the more efficacious medical
[SPEAKER_00]: applications is the synergy that's
involved between THC and CBD in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's led to a very, very interesting
patchwork of legislation across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country that in some cases makes good
sense and provides access, and in other
[SPEAKER_00]: cases just is bewildering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're talking about the CBD
market today, I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: point out that that patchwork of laws has
made a really weird market where at least
[SPEAKER_01]: two things are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing is that patients are
leaving their state and going to another
[SPEAKER_01]: state either temporarily to just make a
purchase or permanently so they can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term supply of whatever part of the
cannabis plant that they need that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: available in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two, the simple arbitrage where
people are going to another state,
[SPEAKER_01]: buying thousands of dollars of whatever
specific medicine is needed in their
[SPEAKER_01]: locale and then bringing it back and then
distributing it amongst their friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had sane national cannabis medicine
law, then this kind of arbitrage and
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry picking where you were going to
purchase from state to state would just
[SPEAKER_01]: not be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is not people trying to be
criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is people trying to work around an
unworkable law.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're saying too is highlighting
just the overall legal landscape in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can basically divide it into,
you can look at it as a tripartite
[SPEAKER_00]: division in terms of legalization going
forward in the United States right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one component, you have medical and
recreational laws or CBD-only laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: are either passed through citizens'
initiatives in states or by state
[SPEAKER_00]: legislatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have large pharmaceutical companies
who are pursuing FDA-approved cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs for very specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have industrial hemp,
which is federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the products that come out of
industrial hemp programs can be shipped to
[SPEAKER_00]: any state legally in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of, in addition to the
cannabinoid research that's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, there's a lot of agronomic research
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having those three totally separate
divisions that are all operating
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously with different restrictions
and different barriers to entry for both
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are in that marketplace or
trying to consume products from those
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplaces, it's created all kinds of
issues, while at the same time providing
[SPEAKER_00]: just enough gray area, I think,
for a lot of people to move forward with
[SPEAKER_00]: some pretty interesting work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets even more messy because the
lexicon is so messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people's usage, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people argue back and
forth between using the word marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has got a sordid history,
versus using the word cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is more accurate and scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even beyond that, you've got people
who are in industrial hemp who like to
[SPEAKER_01]: call their product cannabis, because
technically it's cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got people who are in
medical marijuana, which is also cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa, who want to also use the word hemp
because maybe they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow hemp for victory people back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the industry itself doesn't even
have a stable lexicon where people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: in what you and I would probably see as
different product categories using each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's vocabulary which not only makes it
more confusing for investors, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: totally loses patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legal definitions do exactly the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at the federal guidelines
and marijuana, quote unquote, is any type
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis that contains THC,
over 0.3% by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the definition that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else is considered industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we step back, all of it is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the same larger family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these divisions that we've put
in front of us, whether it's from a
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing perspective or from a legal
perspective, are all social constructs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plants are the same in the
same way that we've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about it from a social science
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Race is probably the best example of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no real genetic difference,
not a meaningful difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: racial categories that have been
constructed over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take one person and analyze their
genome from one particular race that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been assigned to and you compare
it to another person from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: race, you will end up with more
similarities than you would get if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: taken two people from the same race and
analyzed their genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing is true with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are socially constructed boundaries
that are basically vestiges of 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: century prohibition mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we've established pretty
thoroughly that there is a CBD market and
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's growing really quickly,
including both the licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market or medical marijuana market,
and if you know this, the gray market,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you calculate the total size of
the CBD market to be in the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, and this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is my area of expertise,
but I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that would be the honest
answer that anyone who's looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously would tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it has dramatically expanded
in the last two years in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of the high CBD hemp or CBD
flowers that are being produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, at least under the
industrial hemp program, get exported to
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is a very large buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of companies in Europe
that are creating, basically using high
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD flowers as an alternative to tobacco
for smoking cessation, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine cessation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we talked about earlier,
I think the more that's available,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more you're gonna end up seeing
produced because the demand is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this back of the envelope
calculation last year as some legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: was going through the Oregon legislature
that was going to be changing some aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industrial hemp program here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number that I came up with was
specifically for horses, for aged horses,
[SPEAKER_00]: old horses with arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the cool things that has
been demonstrated with CBD is that it not
[SPEAKER_00]: only helps people, but it also helps
animals as well, specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: age-related degeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arthritic horses are large animals that
would require a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically 16,000 acres worth to
be able to treat all of the horses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's horses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's other animals too,
and people could probably benefit from it
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, we're getting close to
having that many acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, this year we will be over
it nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the state of Kentucky has 14,000
acres licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the state of Oregon has 3,000 acres
licensed this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is getting very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, compared to the THC market overall in
the United States, it's still smaller in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of total amount demanded,
total amount produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're going to see a change in
that definitely within the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, isn't that an interesting aspect of
this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, CBD availability is low,
and the demand for it is on a wicked rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, nearly all of the licensed
cannabis producers in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasize high THC strains as their
flagship products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the price of THC is crashing,
and CBD is going down a little bit just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not prohibited as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the demand is so high that you
can't even keep CBD on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, because they think they want to
decrease their risk, most licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: producers are still focusing on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if I had a license, I'd be going all
in on CBD because that market is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: outpace any kind of price decrease for
years and years and years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a certain extent, I agree with you on
that over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the short term, at least the
way that we've seen it unfold in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and Colorado and Oregon,
and I'm assuming we'll see the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in California, with adult use
legalization comes a lot of restrictions,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of security requirements,
and a very, very high overhead in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a lot of money to get
into those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices that we've seen per pound
on CBD-rich flowers, they're way below
[SPEAKER_00]: what high THC flowers command at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in the short term, it makes
good business sense to get into the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: market if you're in a state legal
recreational program or adult use program.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, and we've seen this
both in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: now, the production for THC has typically
outpaced the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it very difficult for
these farmers to actually sell their
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with the CBD side, it tends to go
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's a really good
insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll amend my position a
little bit based on what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one of the reasons why
the price for CBD is not on par as much
[SPEAKER_01]: with THC is because the right CBD products
are not necessarily in the market yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of folks are taking CBD
and spiking them with flavorings or using
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate in an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of the recreational mindset of the
products is not bringing products to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market that is actually CBD for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as product designers get
more sophisticated and understand patients
[SPEAKER_01]: more, the demand will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that happening for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go ahead and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis policy analyst,
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_01]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_01]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the expanded Eden team has been
designing and building industry leading
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions for cannabis extraction ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_01]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts working alone or in tandem with
an initial stream distilling step to
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate monoterpenes before extracting the
rest of the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden offers you many options, including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you are buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear Eden's CEO, AC Braddock talk
about the company's values during shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire episode 19 that was all about CO2
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_01]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'll be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash Eden
to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes also have strain specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset Sherbet
and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_01]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_01]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_01]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com board slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_01]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, you are listening to Shaping
Fire, I'm your host, Shango Los,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our guest this week is cannabis policy
analyst Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first break, or excuse me,
during the first set, we talked pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much exclusively about the size of the
market and how it's just going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger and bigger for all the cannabinoids
in cannabis, but at the moment
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, because of federal
prohibition, there are some states where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not able to get legal whole plant
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're seeing in the market is
a lot of folks have started extracting the
[SPEAKER_01]: single molecule of CBD out of industrial
hemp plants, which are not only
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly legal in the United States,
but also you can buy the single molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD overseas and then people can put them
into whatever the product they're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's become a lot of infighting
between the CBD from hemp people and the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD from whole plant cannabis folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with Seth, how big has the
CBD from hemp market become?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of that is driven,
as you just described, folks importing
[SPEAKER_00]: either crystalline isolate from European
countries or from China, or importing
[SPEAKER_00]: actual industrial hemp flowers and then
doing the extraction here in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, which is, again, federally legal
under the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one actually goes back to 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals decision with the Hemp Industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Association versus the DEA that allowed
for the importation of industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: seed products, flowers, fiber,
et cetera, from other countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: so long as it met that 0.3% THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who aren't very familiar with
what we're talking about, about the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant CBD from medical plants versus
extracted from industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you go ahead and just give a nice
little summary of that for folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp traditionally was,
you know, we know the history of it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically made illegal along with
all other cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Union today and individual
European countries previously had allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp production and different
requirements on THC ranging from 0.2% up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 0.3% were allowed in those countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last 20 years, they developed
a number of different varieties that meet
[SPEAKER_00]: those requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to meet those requirements from a
plant breeding perspective, the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it is to just shut off the THC
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to grow cannabis on an
industrial scale, you have to have plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the THC synthases essentially
turned off inactive alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What normally happens in any cannabis
plant, if the THC side is turned off,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite side is essentially the CBD
production side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these European breeders were by
accident, not necessarily understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were creating CBD cultivars that were
then being used in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the problem with that is that to
attain the 0.2% or the 0.3% THC also
[SPEAKER_00]: requires that your total cannabinoid
content be very, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of overlap between total
oil production with terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things are definitely linked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you end up with is cannabis plants
that come in at, say, 2% CBD, or I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some cultivars now up to 5% CBD
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they lack are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know about the synergistic
relationship between terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the one hand, we have very cheap,
massive scale flowers that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded and grown in hundreds and hundreds
of acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mechanically harvested,
compressed, and shipped over to the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going into the CBD isolate market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have other folks who've
realized that, you know, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make high CBD plants that are also terpene
rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of been a renaissance in
breeding in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very happy to be here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, because I feel like we are
definitely leading the world in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for folks who this information is new
to you, I recommend that you go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to the episode about, oh,
I don't know, about eight weeks ago with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo, where we go through his
historically significant paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: Taming THC, where he talks about the
different components in medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and how each one of them is important from
CBD and THC like we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the terpenes, the flavonoids,
even the lipids and the chlorophyll for
[SPEAKER_01]: some patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's how all of these different
constituents work together versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: other option, which we're also talking
about the CBD from hemp, where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using extraction processes to just pull
out the CBD molecule and make it into an
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate and then put that into a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting when you say Seth that
to see the folks who are buying CBD from
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp without understanding the entourage
effect be surprised when they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily get the medical benefits that
they were hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually see it reflected in
the marketplace at this point as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very funny timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got someone call it Internet spam,
but I got an email this morning from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who was trying to push CBD isolate
just because I am working in that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices right now for CBD isolate
are half of what the raw oil, raw CO2 oil
[SPEAKER_00]: prices are in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm convinced that it's because people
are realizing that the isolate just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work as well for most conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to say all, but for most
conditions that you actually need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: what people refer to as the botanical drug
substance, the BDS, the full whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: That contains both the terpenes major
cannabinoids, but then also the minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seem to be playing an interesting
role that people are working to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, but sort of at the nascent
stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's interesting because,
you know, the folks who are selling CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate as a cure all, they refer to all
of the great things that CBD can do and
[SPEAKER_01]: they refer to the studies, but the studies
are not using CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studies are always using CBD in the
presence of THC and other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're, they're referring to these
studies, which are not actually talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about isolate to support their isolate,
which is, which is a challenge,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, they're marketing people and
they're trying to sell their CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and yet, um, when it comes right down
to it, it's, it's, it's not a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to get you where you want to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had not realized that the, the,
the wholesale prices for isolate had,
[SPEAKER_01]: had crashed so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you think that, um, that there are
any good uses for CBD isolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm sure there are, uh, I personally
haven't found any, um, it's, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that has been very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I will also say, uh, that from my
own personal experience that certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain cultivars of, uh, CBD rich
cannabis plants don't work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's really about finding
something that works really, really well
[SPEAKER_00]: for your particular condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and unfortunately, a lot of this is
still clouded in mystery, um, just in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in part, because, you know, the plants
change, environmental conditions change
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the overall composition,
even if you're working with a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and realistically, I don't think the
analytical capabilities of many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: labs are on par with what we need to be
able to identify all of the substances
[SPEAKER_00]: that are actually medically useful for
particular conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where we have problems all the
way down the line, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got labs that need to get more,
uh, complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more research in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also each plant has got its variables
and each human has their own variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about highly personalized
medicine here, which needs a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I talk about not being a fan
of CBD isolate from hemp when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm doing public speaking and I
always get somebody who wants to argue
[SPEAKER_01]: with me and I, and, and I have to be open
to two possible applications of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate, which can be helpful to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that, um, it seems that CBD
isolate, uh, it tends to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for some people with eczema and
psoriasis topically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, I've got patients that I've talked
to who they, they aren't taking any other
[SPEAKER_01]: form of whole plant cannabinoid or THC or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just using that topically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've gotten some good anecdotal
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm open to that being a possibility
and also patients who can't afford as
[SPEAKER_01]: much, uh, cannabidiol as they need,
uh, they may be taking a, like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tincture and also maybe smoking
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're getting all this whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're getting a wide variety of
cannabinoids, but then they're also taking
[SPEAKER_01]: some CBD isolate to kind of spike how much
CBD they're getting each day, each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, spiking in,
in the environment of all this other whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I kind of got to be open to that
potentially being, you know, offering some
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit too, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's for, for most of these
things, it's you're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case with psoriasis,
psoriasis and eczema, you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole new set of cannabinoid receptors
that have not been investigated properly
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened to exist in our dermal
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, it's just all kinds of every
time we uncover something new,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it raises 50 new questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of being sort of out
on the, out on the outskirts of something
[SPEAKER_00]: new and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard that patients need to be so
flexible at this point and also be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: so much research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're a patient,
you may not have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you may not have the wherewithal to be
doing all this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet the cure that you need is
somewhere in all of this, all these data
[SPEAKER_01]: points and all this education that it has
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I come across folks who have spent
hundreds of dollars on the wrong products
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they get frustrated and then they
go back to their pharmaceuticals or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just, it's so frustrating
to see the people who are at most risk in
[SPEAKER_01]: our society, not being able to get clean
information because in some instances,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants aren't developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in other instances, the research
hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's so much anecdotal
information that people are making serious
[SPEAKER_01]: buying decisions based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a problem and you know,
it's, it's both a problem and a blessing
[SPEAKER_00]: and a curse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult for people to get good
information and to have, I'd say a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent treatment regimen for whatever
it is that ails them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That definitely an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the normal answer in the United States
and in other countries to deal with that
[SPEAKER_00]: is to go the pharmaceutical route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the United States, you know,
the FDA, uh, drug approval process is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is incredibly reductionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sort of the, the worst aspects of
the 20th century, uh, ideas about science
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and methods that you can possibly
dream up and cannabis is by its very
[SPEAKER_00]: nature in its internal synergy and the way
that it works with, with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ends up challenging that, that very
reductionist approach, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incredibly difficult for a large
pharmaceutical company to step in and come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a particular, uh, formulation that
can be replicated over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually work, uh, that involves all
of the compounds that you would find in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a whole, a whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both good in the sense that,
um, you know, it's, it's very complicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also bad in the sense that it's,
it's really hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, we're going to hit,
um, the pharmaceutical industry as a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: after the break, but before the break,
um, I know you are a, um, a gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: how would I, would I, would I say you're
a, a medicinal hemp breeder because what
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed is kind of different,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking, you're taking medicinal
strains and crossing them with
[SPEAKER_01]: traditionally industrial hemp to create
this kind of, you know, hybrid that grows
[SPEAKER_01]: fast and close to each other, but also has
got great turps and a high CBD percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what do you, what do you call
what you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I'm just a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I would say that what, what we are
doing, um, and I, it's not just us,
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there are others who are
participating in this kind of craft
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're, we're trying to create
cannabinoid rich, terpene rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, plants that can be grown, um,
grown on an industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is just being made
possible under the farm bill with less
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictive canopy requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, basically just a federal
legal framework to operate under.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to, you know, at this point
we have, uh, we're running a test field
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 30,000 plants out there on four
foot centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can go through and identify the
standout candidates that are really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting things, not only with the
terpene profiles, the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, but also on the agronomic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we are a breeding company that's
trying to not only make, uh, oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: rich plants, but also make those plants
flower at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, once you step outside of,
uh, you know, growing in a small space or
[SPEAKER_00]: in your backyard and you, you apply
industrial agricultural techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and, you know, try to do it
organically and responsibly as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: you run into a whole host of new issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, like I was mentioning before,
this is just one of those avenues within
[SPEAKER_00]: the legalization framework, uh,
that that's coming out and what's,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really driving our work on the,
on the terpene and cannabinoid side is the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were mentioning before,
the market is actually demanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, terpene rich plants rather than
these, these, uh, these isolate compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a really nerdy question for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people, um, uh, take a shot at
a CBD from hemp by saying that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, CBD from hemp is bad because there's
so little CBD in any part of a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial hemp plant that you have to
extract from just acres and acres of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material in order to get a viable amount
of CBD for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is dangerous because hemp is an
exceptionally good, um, heavy metal and
[SPEAKER_01]: toxin, uh, aggregator from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just pulls it out of the soil,
which is why they use hemp to clean up the
[SPEAKER_01]: areas around toxic spills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And such now on the other side,
um, people are crowing about CBD from
[SPEAKER_01]: medical plants, but at the end of the day,
they're both cannabis sativa and are,
[SPEAKER_01]: are in pull from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a difference in the botany
between industrial hemp, um, pulling up
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins out of the soil versus medical
cannabis plants pulling toxins out of the
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the toxins are there, um, they will be
bioaccumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what we have seen, there's a really
interesting paper that was put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white paper, um, from the Cannabis
Safety Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a organization that was put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli Homes with Phylos was, uh,
one of the, one of the originators of the
[SPEAKER_00]: group and they, they did some,
some work on heavy metal accumulation in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their, their actual final analysis was
that it's not something that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, it's something I'm very worried
about in moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think it's less of a problem
than, uh, just traditional agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we've seen in
Oregon, and I do want to give Oregon just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a, a little bit of a
mention here, cause I think in some ways
[SPEAKER_00]: we are doing things very right on the,
from a safety perspective with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and testing of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have some of the most rigorous
pesticide screens in the world that are at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point for cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding is that even the
people who are doing everything exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: right, who did not spray anything on their
plants, who are operating biodynamically
[SPEAKER_00]: and organically and just farming,
farming in a, in a sustainable way,
[SPEAKER_00]: they still end up getting contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because of anything they've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of just how pervasive
pesticides and herbicides are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and widely used in,
in agricultural areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that I think is something to be very,
very concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, that's why you see so
much of the industrial hemp from other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries getting turned into isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of contamination from,
from pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, we're going to be
talking about the opportunities in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you are listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is cannabis policy analyst,
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use as little electricity as
possible, but if you haven't studied or
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented light deprivation techniques
into your greenhouse, you're leaving a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of money on the table by incorporating
light deprivation solutions into your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_01]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy and affordable to
[SPEAKER_01]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever flowering greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades, and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, forever flowering will help
[SPEAKER_01]: you produce crop after crop of well cared
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_01]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just starting out, forever
flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_01]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.

[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis normalization sweeps the
country, knowledge of how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally and without synthetic inputs has
become more and more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, probiotic growers are
experiencing large yields and exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles without using chemicals
banned in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move away from the risks inherent to
chemical nutrients and instead invest in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your soil again and again,
reducing costs and improving the vitality
[SPEAKER_01]: of your soil with each cycle.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shangelos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is cannabis policy
analyst, Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far we've talked about how huge the
CBD market is and why it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: know your source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that of course is going to lead us
into the opportunities for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry because the
pharmaceutical industry has certainly seen
[SPEAKER_01]: the promise in CBD and has begun bringing
products to the market like Sativex from
[SPEAKER_01]: GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But medical cannabis activists are very
concerned that if cannabis is made
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule two, it will leave it solely in
the hands of big pharma, which won't
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit anyone except for big pharma
pocketbooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Seth, what are your thoughts on the
attempts by pharmaceutical companies to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop and profit from CBD medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated, just like the plant,
which is why I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceuticals is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were granted essentially a
monopoly in the UK to do cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research that they have done is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually changing the way that people
look at not only THC, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, the non-psychoactive
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a world-class breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in possession of some absolutely
incredible plants that nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of us are just basically trying
to play catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem with that is that we're
playing catch up with, as I just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, a government-granted monopoly
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And American farmers, American researchers
have not had the ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the inroads that GW has in the last
15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue with this is that they're
trying to basically protect their
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term profit with the creation of
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 20 to 1 CBD to THC compound that is
going through clinical trials in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States for Dravet syndrome,
for childhood epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are all really good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main issue is that now GW
Pharmaceuticals is engaging with lobbyists
[SPEAKER_00]: in states all across the country,
particularly states that do not have adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use, medical, or even CBD-only laws in
place yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're trying to do is lobby
those legislatures to pass bills that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially ban non-FDA-approved CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who wants to get a CBD product
then in those states would be required
[SPEAKER_00]: under the state law to purchase GW
Pharmaceuticals' version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole host of other issues that
come along with that in terms of creating
[SPEAKER_00]: problems for patients and other types of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main issue to me is just from a
supply standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceuticals just spent $40 million
to build out a brand new production
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in California specifically for
their CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: $40 million was how much it cost them to,
in the letter that they sent out to their
[SPEAKER_00]: investors, to be able to produce 1,000
pounds of CBD-rich cannabis per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're successful in being able to
lobby CBD products out of states and they
[SPEAKER_00]: put their own product on the market and
they're only able to produce 1,000 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: a year, I think we're all going to be in a
world of hurt and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paying, in their estimates, their own
financial estimates, anywhere between $83
[SPEAKER_00]: to $166 per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,000, that's not nearly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they have an exclusive market,
that's ridiculously low for all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of Oregon, we have that
epidemiological estimates are of 615
[SPEAKER_00]: children with Dravet syndrome,
just based on representation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those children require 12
pounds of cannabis, high CBD cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're talking 15% CBD or higher
extracted and turned into oil just to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to meet their needs for a single
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 pounds is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something that any decent
industrial hemp farmer who's growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: high cannabinoid content seed can do on
one acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: One acre of farmland, let's say here in
the valley in Oregon, rents for,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, $300, $350.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment that it would take to
actually go out and plant and harvest an
[SPEAKER_00]: acre of cannabis, most farmers have it
just sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale and the cost, the economics of
trying to pursue some of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds from a pharmaceutical
perspective with all the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: burdens and investors and that sort of
thing is just completely out of line with
[SPEAKER_00]: what this plant can actually do and what
farmers can do with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my mind is racing ahead thinking
about if the pharmaceutical companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: successful with their lobbyists to not
allow independent licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producers to create and distribute CBD and
two things will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, the pharmaceutical companies
will have it locked up and so ordinary law
[SPEAKER_01]: abiding people will be forced to get some
kind of not whole plant stripped down
[SPEAKER_01]: version from the pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what's really going to happen is
that the gray market for CBD is just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to explode because most people know that
they want a whole plant CBD and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want it from a pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an enforcement and legal mess that
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets even more complicated,
as it always does, in that states have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to regulate their own medicines as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why GW has gone after
individual states trying to pass these
[SPEAKER_00]: laws rather than trying to do it at the
national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely lobbying Congress and
the FDA and the DEA on a regular basis to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to make their product the only one
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, there's always
been a lot of people growing cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the reason that it made
enforcement of any type of prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now the genie is completely,
completely out of the bottle with hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: production and all other forms of cannabis
production at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be very difficult
for any pharmaceutical company if they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a very unique product that
works incredibly well and they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors to be able to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to have a very
difficult time in recouping all those
[SPEAKER_00]: millions and millions of dollars they've
put into research.
[SPEAKER_01]: GW Pharma is one of the companies who are
working on CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an idea of how many other
pharmaceutical companies have got CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not CBD products specifically,
but the last time I checked with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal Register, there were over 60
different companies that had registered
[SPEAKER_00]: with the DEA to be able to produce
cannabinoid products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a call for proposals that the
DEA put out for basically new product
[SPEAKER_00]: development and production to increase the
total supply of cannabis that was
[SPEAKER_00]: available for researchers through the
National Institutes on Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently the University of Mississippi's
12 acres is not enough and the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have there is not good enough to meet
all the researchers' demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it's led to is a pretty big
explosion of mostly small but also some
[SPEAKER_00]: medium-sized firms entering into the
cannabinoid pharmaceutical marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: To go back to your one example with GW
Pharma, if they spent 40 million on this
[SPEAKER_01]: series of greenhouses to grow,
I think you said 1,000 pounds of over 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD a year, will they simply just scale up
and produce more of those to reach demand
[SPEAKER_01]: or does scaling up at those numbers not
work to bring the product price down?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're dealing with is the demand and
the need is so much higher than what could
[SPEAKER_00]: be achieved with a closed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that GW had to spend so much
money on that is all the security
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that go along with producing
a Schedule I compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouses have to be completely
secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product facility has to be spotless
and cameras everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has to be monitored at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come out to our farm, it's a field
full of plants and we don't have any of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff except for a time-lapse camera
because we just like watching what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants over the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally different environment and a lot of
the other farmers that are doing this have
[SPEAKER_00]: scaled in a similar way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was mentioning before, you can't
provide CBD to all the arthritic horses in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good point you
made because the idea that the way that GW
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing it with all of the fences and the
security and the cameras and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, it's an assumption that it's still
a prohibitive or criminal drug that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be wild drug crazed people
are going to be trying to break in to
[SPEAKER_01]: steal all of this stuff that won't get
them high at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still might be cannabis and the taboo
might still be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do not routinely steal CBD because
they're patients and they're generally too
[SPEAKER_01]: sick to steal anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this goes back to that tripartite
division when you've got folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: developing pharmaceutical products,
you have people that are developing
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational products and you have people
who are just doing things a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently on the economic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is always going to be a
market for the types of products that
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabinoid pharmaceutical research
companies are putting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's really important for us
to not necessarily support a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: got to their spot and their market
position via a natural monopoly in another
[SPEAKER_00]: country before Americans could actually do
the research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also important to see the
benefits that have come out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: research because as a plant breeder,
I read the work that GW Pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They published these articles in peer
review journals about how to attain
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of cannabinoids in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, it just became an analytical
and a sifting process for us to find those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing good things, but when you
turn it into a monopoly and you try to
[SPEAKER_00]: control access to something that is
already proliferating throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, that's when I start to have
issues and question the motives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an awesome transition to our last
topic, which is I too read the GW Pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: papers because I wanted to find out what
was in Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes right down to it,
it's essentially roughly 2.5 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and 2.5 milligrams of CBD in an oral
spray that you're supposed to take as
[SPEAKER_01]: needed up to five times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so easy to reverse engineer into an
alcohol tincture and then boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got whole plant Sativex that you
made at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing for sure, the gray market will
be providing CBD to neighbors and family
[SPEAKER_01]: and loved ones probably forever now that
CBD genetics are all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's any model that would
quell people from growing and sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: their own CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: With sick friends now that the genetics
are everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that would make sense is if
you can walk into a store and buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and you don't have to grow it,
prepare it, and basically compound the
[SPEAKER_00]: substance to give to your friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walk into most stores at this
point, those products are already on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf when it comes to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge, of course, is the model
that you and I were just discussing where
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD goes schedule two and is solely in the
hands of pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would theoretically put pressure on
the states to remove CBD from their
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing structure, which I don't know
how that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that you just can't limit
availability of CBD because if you put any
[SPEAKER_01]: restriction on it, the people will work
around it because their health is way more
[SPEAKER_01]: important to people than following the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this move by GW
Pharmaceuticals and reaching out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that we work with here in Oregon
and saying, if they're going to go forward
[SPEAKER_00]: with this, and this is something to keep
in mind as well with just the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws are written.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the states actually do
have a little bit of control over drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're manufacturing a product in your
state and that product does not leave your
[SPEAKER_00]: state, it's sold within the boundaries and
under the legal framework of your state,
[SPEAKER_00]: the FDA can't do anything to step in and
say, hey, you can't do that unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making medical claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of CBD and children with
Dravet syndrome, we could just give it
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a perspective of seeing cannabis
culture change now that it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: permeated by legalization and the forces
that come along with modern late stage
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalism, to me that's a beautiful
contribution to keep in line with what the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who kept cannabis alive during the
prohibition would want to have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think companies like GW need
to be very careful with their approach
[SPEAKER_00]: because people have the ability to
undermine what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monoculization doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people have been saying,
free the plant for all these decades,
[SPEAKER_01]: free the plant for pharmaceutical
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted it back in the hands of the
citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'm going to hammer it
home one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research that they're doing is stuff
that ... I have a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how science works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do what these big companies are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some really incredible work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be able to get that product in
the hands of people who could benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They deserve to make some money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total control of the marketplace is not
something that should ever be ceded to any
[SPEAKER_00]: individual or a corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Seth, thank you so much for taking
the time to be on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice to talk to somebody who's
got a command of the economics of the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: market like you do because so much of the
talk around CBD is just myth and rumor and
[SPEAKER_01]: people are playing the telephone game with
facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to come and talk to somebody
like you who has done doctoral research in
[SPEAKER_01]: this and is essentially an Uber nerd is
very refreshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your time.
