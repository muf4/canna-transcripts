[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there friends, Shango here from
Shaping Fire and I'm with my good buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler Marquardt who's here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here to talk about Tyler's Buchner
funnel technique and some of you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: already seen the video that we did I don't
know almost two years ago now when he was
[SPEAKER_01]: here when he had just figured out this
technique and you know Tyler helps me with
[SPEAKER_01]: hash all the time and so he came up to do
that with me and then he brought this get
[SPEAKER_01]: up with him and I'm all like oh my god I
am I am always going to use this when I
[SPEAKER_01]: make hash from here on out and so so we
posted that video on YouTube and I told
[SPEAKER_01]: some people about it on Instagram and the
response was pretty significant people
[SPEAKER_01]: were pretty stoked to have an option that
dries out their hash very quickly without
[SPEAKER_01]: the high budget tool of a freeze dryer and
like I mean I think we all want our freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: dryer right freeze dryers are great and
and totally are useful but like you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of us are balling on a budget and this
definitely falls in that category so so I
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking with Tyler and since he was
going to be up here on Vashon Island this
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend helping me out I said hey man
let's go ahead and do an update video
[SPEAKER_01]: because the first one we did we didn't
actually realize it was going to be such
[SPEAKER_01]: like a big hit and we did kind of a pretty
quick abbreviated version and I'm all like
[SPEAKER_01]: well you might we might as well do a
longer version with all of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that he has developed you know
in the last 18 months or whatever and so
[SPEAKER_01]: so here we are with this so Tyler thanks
for joining me thank you for having me all
[SPEAKER_01]: right so so let's start with the the
purpose what is the purpose of the device
[SPEAKER_00]: so this device will help hash makers at
home dry their hash faster so that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a reduction in any sort of contamination
through mold issues from having too much
[SPEAKER_00]: water in your material it's going to allow
water to come out really quickly and by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that you're giving yourself a much
better chance to have a higher end quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product around so let's let's go through
the equipment first because I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of folks out there like me
who who were not familiar with the Buckner
[SPEAKER_01]: funnel at first so so why don't you start
at the top and work our way through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum pump absolutely so at the top here
we're gonna have this hair band just I
[SPEAKER_00]: belong here so this works out well for me
you could use a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things a rubber band but this is just what
I have on hand and that is going to secure
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece of aluminium foil which has a
very small hole in it here you can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip of a pen to poke that through this is
going to create a suction device other
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the internet who've been using
this has shown me that they've used
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupperware tops or some sort of plastic
top and they've been burping it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit there's a variety of different things
that you can use I just had this readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available so that's what I ended up using
and it works really well if you don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: the hole big enough it will pop this off
into the air and you'll be very surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: at that when that happens then we have the
actual top piece here which is connected
[SPEAKER_00]: to the vacuum pump this has a glass frit
disc in it and it has a tube on the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows a vacuum to be pulled through
the flask and so you could use a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of different sizes this is a 500ml top and
a 2000ml flask this is more stable giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you the stability at my place I use a
1000ml flask and a 1000ml or I'm sorry a
[SPEAKER_00]: 500ml flask and a 1000ml funnel and that
allows me to put larger amounts in and
[SPEAKER_00]: still pull a tight vacuum then going from
the tube here into the vacuum pump is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much all the parts so you have 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 parts in total to the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment so a couple things I want to
point out this frit disc which is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially a filter it's built in so you
don't buy these separately this is one
[SPEAKER_01]: piece which I didn't realize at first when
I was first starting to shop for it there
[SPEAKER_01]: you go and so Ty just to give people a
general idea the pump is kind of separate
[SPEAKER_01]: things so this piece and this piece which
is where I actually don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly expense what should people expect
to pay for that on Amazon or something for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure so you can get in a variety of
different sizes but this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: less than $75 for the two of them
depending on the type of glass the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of glass like everything has quality
ranges right and so depending on where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get it from and all that it's going to be
less than $100 wow yeah much less than a
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze dryer yeah absolutely all right so
now we know we're using it to take water
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the hash material very quickly and
it's an affordable option so will you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: us through the using of it yep absolutely
so what we'll do is we'll take the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bag when we're pulling the the
45 bag or the 73 or the 90 whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to use take that material out put
it onto a screen we've been using these
[SPEAKER_00]: five inch by five inch screens that were
provided by the press club for us to use
[SPEAKER_00]: here and that then goes into the funnel
area and you place it down lay it flat I
[SPEAKER_00]: find that often slicing the paddy a little
bit will help with air getting through and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it to dry a little bit faster you
don't have to do that once that's on there
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to take the aluminum
foil here put it on the top secure it with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever device that you have again you
don't have to use aluminum foil you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use a plastic lid they probably actually
make if you're into chemistry and you work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a chemistry lab there probably is a
device that they actually legitimately
[SPEAKER_00]: make for this I just haven't looked for it
yet because this works really well this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just in my kitchen and just one less thing
to purchase on and over and yeah so then
[SPEAKER_00]: you hook up the tubing here make sure the
tubing is attached this has I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the name of it now but it'll
attach itself without coming off I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: the vacuum won't pull the tube off so you
don't have to secure that to that at all
[SPEAKER_00]: and then on this side I did secure it with
a mount and so that's mounted to that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you purchase these pumps something to note
is that they usually need to be filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with oil so you will have to buy some
vacuum pump oil you can purchase that at
[SPEAKER_00]: your local like auto store I think I went
to like O'Reilly's or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: and like just they had a bottle there but
vacuum pump oil it needs to be specific
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum pump oil and and then they have a
max minimum line usually on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and there also is like a glass chamber you
can see how much oil you have in there so
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps you set that up once it's all
hooked up and everything's attached like
[SPEAKER_00]: we have here and the hash is in there just
turn the pump on I let it run in between
[SPEAKER_00]: the runs so when I make hash I usually do
a three minute run depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of hash and and all the standards
that go around it three minutes allows it
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull most of the water out it's still
going to be wet it's not a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: dry it's not like a miracle but you can
see individual granule you know yeah it
[SPEAKER_01]: turns it from like what is essentially wet
mud to being just barely damp sand correct
[SPEAKER_01]: and like that's such I mean that saves two
days at least of oxidation doing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: like dehumidifiers and fans absolutely
absolutely and so yeah so once you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage it just starts pulling through
you can see in this that we've pulled from
[SPEAKER_00]: today we've pulled out a fair amount of
water just from what we've run here yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: right on so let's talk about the vacuum
pump I know when we did our last video we
[SPEAKER_01]: were using aquarium pumps right so will
you compare like the experience of using
[SPEAKER_01]: an aquarium pump versus using this badass
bitch yeah yeah absolutely this really
[SPEAKER_00]: moves air faster also having a smaller
base and a smaller top will help pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum harder faster too but mostly this
is a fork CFM cubic feet per minute pump
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other ones we were using were like
point two or point five so this really
[SPEAKER_00]: just made a huge difference and these are
like less than a hundred dollars I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this one was like 79 or it came out to be
like nice so really this is like 200 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: all in $200 you know maybe this is a
couple you go to Home Depot and or your
[SPEAKER_00]: local hardware store and you can find the
tubing there for you know a couple bucks a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot or a couple with inflation who knows
what it is these days nonetheless it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive for less than 200 or 250 bucks
you're pretty much set and ready to go
[SPEAKER_01]: right on and you know if if you want to
take a look at these parts I'm gonna post
[SPEAKER_01]: links below to these and then you know you
know if you want to get something else by
[SPEAKER_01]: all means but you can actually see what
what we were rocking here in the links
[SPEAKER_01]: below so so now Tyler like like I've been
watching you all day as we've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know these these rounds you're you've
got the hash and it's on the mesh screen
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you turn on it and it like pulls
down the water which is like obvious and
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing and then you take it off what do
you do when you take it off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Buechner funnel yep so when we take it out
we're gonna put it on the table we take a
[SPEAKER_00]: knife and just kind of chop it up a little
bit more break it up so that it gets more
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area and then you have a lot of
different options you can go from there
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using a wine fridge wine fridges
are about can be set the digital ones you
[SPEAKER_00]: can set to about 45 degrees so it's a good
temperature to keep the that down they
[SPEAKER_00]: also sometimes keep the humidity low in
the 50 to 60 percent range which is good
[SPEAKER_00]: so that'll help it dry a little faster
we've also found that putting dry ice into
[SPEAKER_00]: that or putting dry ice into a cooler with
a cookie drying sheet or sorry the the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie aluminum wire racks yeah sorry the
wire racks the the cookie drying wire
[SPEAKER_00]: racks those you put those down and you
then put the 25 micron or 15 micron
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever size you decide to use sheet on
that with the hash on it and then the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: ice will act as a desiccant and pull the
rest of the water out you can use a cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you have a cooler to go to the
beach with or take a picnic and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: that in there with the dry ice and then
that will help pull the rest of it out but
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially in less than 36 hours or 24
hours depending on how much material you
[SPEAKER_00]: have obviously the more hash you're making
the more space you need to dry and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth but once you have that figured out
within 24 to 36 hours you're pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go so so you say 24 to 36 hours
break that out into how much time is at
[SPEAKER_01]: each place so of that time is it like you
know 24 to 36 hours but only the first
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 minutes is in this like like like
give me the location of the hash for those
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours yeah it's a it's also a nuanced
thing I think to start with is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: your relative to humidity I live in
California near the beach so we are in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area where in the mornings it's 90 percent
humidity easy pretty much almost every day
[SPEAKER_00]: it drops in the afternoon and then back up
in the evening and so you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious of what your relative humidity
is unless you're using a dehumidifier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room or the tent that you're you're
washing and stuff or you're processing all
[SPEAKER_00]: this in so that is kind of your biggest
mitigating factor but when you pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash out of the bag you put it in here I'm
running it for about three to six minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how long I make my runs so if
I'm making a three minute run on the on
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine this will the run before that
will will be drying in here once the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine stops and I'm draining while it's
draining I go I'll pull this out move it
[SPEAKER_00]: set this up so that I can move the next
one in and then kind of cycle through like
[SPEAKER_00]: that if I find that the material isn't
like the best material and I can wash it
[SPEAKER_00]: at six minutes it dries a little bit
faster it does seem like there's a bell
[SPEAKER_00]: curve where like if you do have high
humidity it'll dry it out but then all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden it starts getting a little bit
more moisture back into it but again it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it all is I think associated with the
relative humidity in the immediate area
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working in once it's in there
three to six minutes usually is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good ten minutes will get it really really
really pretty dry like we saw you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it almost into sand yeah and and
then after that it just move it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry chambers break it up put it in a
dry chamber and then I was taking a sieve
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting it in there sieving it up and
then that opens up the airflow even more I
[SPEAKER_00]: love more surface area and and it drives
it even faster within a couple hours after
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's pretty good to go right on so as
we all know this has been an evolving
[SPEAKER_01]: technique right like you're doing it more
sophisticated than we did whatever there
[SPEAKER_01]: was 18 months ago when we recorded the
first video are there any problem points
[SPEAKER_01]: that you are experiencing now that you are
trying to sort out at this point like
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you know all of us in
cannabis we trade best practices right so
[SPEAKER_01]: so are there any solutions that you're
looking for that that other people could
[SPEAKER_00]: be thinking about yes so there's a couple
things one somebody online mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in a vapor trap here so that
either oil doesn't go back in or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: collect terpenes and stuff that comes out
that's pretty good idea you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously don't want oil pumping back into
the situation I haven't seen any traces of
[SPEAKER_00]: that or anything because it would also
have to go all the way back up past the
[SPEAKER_00]: frit disc past the other micron filter so
there's some other stuff that I have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through let's hit on that a second time
because as you know YouTube jerk boys you
[SPEAKER_01]: know they like leave all these stupid
comments and there have been like a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have left like you're like eye
rolling comments about how using this
[SPEAKER_01]: technique is gonna make your hash taste
like oil right and like but um would you
[SPEAKER_01]: explain just like for the back of the room
why the oil from the pump is not gonna end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in your hash yeah the the amount of
pressure coming through is so much it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just I mean this is what I've been using
for the last two months and there's no oil
[SPEAKER_00]: in here at all and you can see it hasn't
been collecting any oil so you know having
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a preventive measure sure would be
great it's an added cost that maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: know somebody can't afford if it's a $50
unit or $100 unit I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: needed personally I haven't had any any of
the hash tastes like it's flavored off or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that and I looked under a
microscope haven't seen anything awkward
[SPEAKER_00]: or any sheens anything like that so for
that nature I don't think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly needed but you know for
somebody who maybe wants to be extra
[SPEAKER_00]: careful sure if you or if you want to
experiment have the money and you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that it does make a difference and you can
do an AB run and have it tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: petrochemicals then that that's awesome
you know we definitely encourage people to
[SPEAKER_00]: take this and and expand it even more and
if you have those capabilities to do sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of that R&D let us know what what turns
out so that we can let other people know
[SPEAKER_01]: last time we posted the video there were
like a whole bunch of comments from people
[SPEAKER_01]: saying like you know dude you need to
monetize this why you giving this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: away from free some some some Chad's gonna
like like bring this into the market and
[SPEAKER_01]: make all your money and just to kind of
like pre-answer the people who are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: comment below the video what is your
answer to this yeah I mean I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: invent anything I literally just took
things that existed and was like well and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure other people have already done
this I mean other people have mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're like oh yeah I did that a few
years ago or something so it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that like I'm like I'm the
inventor of this put my name on it like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important it's I literally just was
working I've been working in a lab and I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw this equipment and it just hit and I
was like I was thinking about buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dryer one day and I was like I
really don't want to spend 3,500 bucks to
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 on a freeze dryer like there's got
to be something other other way around it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just kind of clicked and you know
being a patient and having access to high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality medicine is always like important
to me I thought why not just get this
[SPEAKER_00]: information out I'm not manufacturing
something that's unique like somebody else
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactures this somebody else I would
basically be a middleman for like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: selling lab equipment to somebody where
you could just go buy it off of Amazon I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna mark it up 20% because I'm the
guy who invented it right right right it
[SPEAKER_01]: up or something like that also you know
one of the reasons why Tyler and I became
[SPEAKER_01]: friends early on is we won't both really
believe in the self sufficiency of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and not everybody has got a you
know the budget for a freeze dryer or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sexy lab or all these things we're just
trying to like you know do some home grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and process it into hash that so that we
have easy access to medicine and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: you know make using licensed stores an
option for us instead of making us have to
[SPEAKER_01]: use them right and that kind of
independence I think is really important
[SPEAKER_01]: for people who rely on their cannabis
medicine so all right so to wrap this up
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this is a continually continuing
to evolve technology so if you have ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: that might improve on this by all means
leave them in the comments and then Tyler
[SPEAKER_01]: you often talk about this technique on
your Instagram and as you come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: like new best practices you share them so
where can people follow you on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: if they want to find out more and kind of
just follow along with your trip yep my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram handle is just my name Tyler
Markwort and I posted on there also I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: linked in too so if you're on there you
can find some information on there as well
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically shoots you back to my IG
yeah shoot you over to shaping fire but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah those are pretty much the two spots
that I'm not on Facebook so right on all
[SPEAKER_01]: right cool well thank you for interest in
the Bookner funnel technique and thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler for sharing with everybody
appreciate it all right thanks all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so now we're gonna take the cash which is
on the screen that we've cut out and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to place it inside of the Buckner
funnel and make sure it sits in there then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna take our aluminium foil with a
tiny little hole in the top we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: place it on top we're gonna take a hair
tie you can use something else this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I use because I have it readily
available for my long hair put it on make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's secure and then we're gonna turn
on the vacuum pump
[SPEAKER_00]: now you can see the water is coming out of
the Buckner funnel into the Buckner flask
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is pulling out water really quickly
so roughly three to six minutes it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially more dry than it was before
