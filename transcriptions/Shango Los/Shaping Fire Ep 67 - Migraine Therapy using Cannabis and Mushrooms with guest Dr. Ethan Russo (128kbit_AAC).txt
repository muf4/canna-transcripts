[SPEAKER_01]: One of the greatest challenges in life is
to suffer from an ailment that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: chosen to take for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: There exists a variety of diseases and
other health issues that are so common
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are actually seen as natural or
somehow to be expected and therefore not
[SPEAKER_01]: as motivating for medical research or
empathy from others.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be entirely life debilitating but
because they seem to be intractable and
[SPEAKER_01]: their solution not impending or media
engaging, they become just taken for
[SPEAKER_01]: granted and people lose interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about one of
these health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Migraines are a headache disorder that
affects 15% of everyone in the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically these migraine headaches last
from a few hours to three days and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symptoms include nausea, vomiting and
severe sensitivity to light, sound and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: While some folks can function during these
episodes, the majority need to withdraw
[SPEAKER_01]: from society and hide from sensory
stimulation and simply bear the pain until
[SPEAKER_01]: it passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astonishingly, we still do not understand
why humans have migraines at all.

[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington and as visiting professor at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three-month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo has joined us before on shaping

[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the shaping fire sessions
on the shaping fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk about treating
migraines with cannabis and psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to shaping fire, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's great to be here once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into talking about and
getting a better understanding of what
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's such a variety of them that when
I'm talking to patients and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining their symptoms to me,
they can be all over the place and yet
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow they all fit into this basket
called migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: What technically are migraines and why
does there seem to be such a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, migraine is probably the most
complex biochemical disorder that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: humans that we're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it encompasses a lot of territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone recognizes that the most
basic level that it's kind of headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, they're forms of migraine
with no headache at all, just to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a condition that often runs in
families, but it's not strongly genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are aspects of it that enter into
questions about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, families can be affected,
but families often have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can certainly affect the tendency
towards this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But migraine is most often recognized as a
headache that is associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: throbbing type pain, usually on one side
of the head, in other words, unilateral,
[SPEAKER_00]: also associated with some odd phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not be associated with an
aura.
[SPEAKER_00]: An aura is a warning that consists of a
change in neurologic function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common of which is a visual
disturbance that could include an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: field cut where you lose vision totally on
one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist in the person's brain at
that time, but also can include what is
[SPEAKER_00]: called scintillating scotomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are flashing lights or sparkles or
lightning bolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it can include visual distortions like
things look like they're melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very disturbing symptom,
and that often presages a headache to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are situations in which the aura
occurs without the headache, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a migraine equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other features of migraine that are
quite commonly present are association
[SPEAKER_00]: with nausea and vomiting and two other
phenomena that are called photophobia and
[SPEAKER_00]: phonophobia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photophobia is literally fear of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phonophobia is fear of sound, and this is
what leads people with a migraine to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in hibernation behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're going to want to do is hide
away in a dark, quiet room, try to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, and that often will stop the
migraine if they can get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been an affliction of humans
for as long as there's been recorded
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the ancient Greeks and
obviously much before that, we probably
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the writing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, for at least 1,200 years,
it's been noted that cannabis can be an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suspect we'll get into that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with these different types of
manifestations, these different symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got localized pain, we've got the
radiant type, we've got these auras that
[SPEAKER_01]: can warn us, and then some include the
sharp stabbing ice pick kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have got different symptoms than
other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes the same patient will
have different symptoms from migraine to
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, oh, I'm having a migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can tell it's this kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any explanation for why
migraines would show up with different
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms in the same human?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've made a distinction between what are
called simple migraines, where there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: headache with the associated symptoms,
and classic migraine, which would have the
[SPEAKER_00]: aura followed by the headache and
associated symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although some people tend to split these
into different diagnoses, they really are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the same package.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's similar pathophysiology,
which is to say the underlying basis and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomena seem to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, people with migraine tend to
think that these different tendencies over
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of a lifetime may manifest
different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to be what's called a lumper and
put them in a more single category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recognize that if these are,
I guess for the sake of this interview,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be a lumper too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to lump them together,
is the underlying mechanism for pain the
[SPEAKER_01]: same between the different types?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they all going to be caused by
subtly different mechanisms in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: body?
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying biochemical effects seem to
be held in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm going to say that they're
largely the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should state at the outset that this is
not created by muscles pulling on the
[SPEAKER_00]: head, what has been called in the past
tension headache or muscle contraction
[SPEAKER_00]: headache has very little objective
evidence to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, most headaches fall under a
more broader rubric of migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's involved is exceedingly complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the pain, it seems to be due
to release of chemicals that excite the
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may have its basis in a lower part
of the brain, the brainstem part called
[SPEAKER_00]: substantia nigra and is involved to some
degree, but particularly in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: called the periaqueductal gray in the
brainstem is felt to be the so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this is the generator, it starts
there and then how the chemicals that it
[SPEAKER_01]: puts out impacts different people in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's taking what is essentially the
same action, but how our bodies use those
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals is based more on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a close understanding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, it'd be hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can say is that there are chemical
changes that sensitize the nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenomena that normally are not
painful, such as the beating of the heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching the blood vessels creates a
pounding pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully people don't have this all the
time because it's very disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the case that migraine is
associated with both biochemical changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that affect the nerves, but also changes
in blood vessels, what are called vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the old literature, there were a lot
of people that thought that this was more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a plumbing issue, that it had to do
with blood vessels being too big or too
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact, those are more secondary
changes that really are more related to
[SPEAKER_00]: the complex biochemical disturbance that's
going on during a migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move forward, I want to jump
back to something that you said in
[SPEAKER_01]: passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that you said that there's a
common misperception that migraines are
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by, I think you said, the
stretching of muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not uncommon for me to hear from
patients that they believe it's the fascia
[SPEAKER_01]: that is between the skin of their scalp
and the skull, that there's some issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with the fascia that surrounds the skull,
and or some people will not, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: pull their hair back into ponytails
because they believe that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: irritating the fascia or the musculature
in some way of the head and that may be an
[SPEAKER_01]: onset to their migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that comment meant to suggest that
this belief is a myth and they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: related but there's no actual scientific
correlation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it says is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may note a variety of triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference between a trigger and
a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling the hair back isn't a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a trigger for some people
because one of the effects of migraine as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as other clinical endocannabinoid
deficiencies is a supersensitization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of having pain where it doesn't
belong because the tissues look normal so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people with migraine may have areas
of spot tenderness throughout the scalp or
[SPEAKER_00]: a face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even between headaches, they may have
spots that when they're pressed are
[SPEAKER_00]: unusually sensitive or painful but there
are many other triggers for migraines too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people it's certain foods that
may contain the amino acid teramine in
[SPEAKER_00]: strong cheese or red wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other people, exposure to flashing
lights or overly bright sunshine may act
[SPEAKER_00]: as a trigger and so people with migraine
often wear broad-brimmed hats and
[SPEAKER_00]: polarized sunglasses to reduce glare,
this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or exposure to excessive noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of these things can act as a trigger
to migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's tease out that trigger a little bit
because one thing that I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: patients have in common is their
particular set of environmental triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not it's light or sound or
strong smells or a food, most patients
[SPEAKER_01]: have got the things that they tend to
avoid because they can trigger the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines for them and especially
overstimulation in any category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are all of these doing one thing that
stimulates the area of the brain that you
[SPEAKER_01]: said most of the migraines come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something going on with the
stimulation and then the nervous system
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that begets the migraine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that direct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use an analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppose we had kids around a pool and
they're taking buckets of water
[SPEAKER_00]: individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Johnny has a bucket and Sally has a
bucket and it really doesn't matter whose
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket it was but at a certain point the
pool overflows and with migraine it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: a combination of one strong trigger and a
couple of minor triggers but in the end it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a relationship to stress
but it isn't the way people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're gonna make broad categorizations,
it's often said that migraineurs,
[SPEAKER_00]: people with a susceptibility to migraine,
often function really well under stress
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're very prone to what's called a
holiday headache or weekend headache or a
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the stress is over, that's when
they'll get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the downtime and it can similarly
come from sleeping too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just countless factors and it is
the case that people with migraine often
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from keeping regular habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, set bedtime and time to
get up, regular meals, not skipping meals,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these things can contribute to the
tendency to have an attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that folks who experience
migraines regularly are pretty unsatisfied
[SPEAKER_01]: with this answer based on the state of the
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people like you who are actually doing
the research trying to know more,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you all say over coffee or beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's such a mess, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you all discuss with each other
about how you actually help people when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so varied?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to be honest, migraine was one of my
favorite things to treat because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that we had good things to offer
people and I always appreciated its
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the reason that I saw new
patients one an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern medicine doesn't give most
practical practitioners that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: luxury.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to go through this, to get an adequate
history, addressing triggers, addressing
[SPEAKER_00]: what migraine is about and prescribing a
course of action that would include
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine but also lifestyle adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a full hour and that's after
having previously spent spending time
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the past medical history,
which hopefully was there in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is complex and it's not
amenable to the current 15 minute
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not very appropriate for,
they've got a hard job to do, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: your general physician, your family
physician that you go in, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have necessarily the depth nor
the hour to give a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can see how people would be
frustrated in trying to find a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we move on to talking about how
migraines and endocannabinoid deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: work together or don't, I wanted to hit on
real quick hormones as being a trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's incredibly common for women
who are three times more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience migraines than men are that
they will experience them around their
[SPEAKER_01]: monthly cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very often I'll hear a female patient
curse her cycle and the hormones and the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine in the same breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are those related?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly the case that hormones can be
a trigger and the most common association
[SPEAKER_00]: with migraine would be for them to occur
perimenstrally, but in some women they
[SPEAKER_00]: could occur at the time of ovulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just another factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, women were often told,
well, you know, when you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: menopause, these will stop something to
look forward to, ha ha, from a male
[SPEAKER_00]: physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is sometimes true, but not always
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not something to look forward
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of unknown factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we mentioned genetics, but I've
really come to believe that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important relationship to the
endocannabinoid system that is similarly
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by diet and the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the bacteria in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that certainly could be stronger and a
strong explanation for why it seems that
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine is more common in some circles
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are relationships of migraine to
differences regionally that have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with traditional lifestyles versus quote
modern unquote lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and dig into
endocannabinoid deficiency right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I was most
attracted to your papers tying
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency and migraines
together is that, you know, when
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining the endocannabinoid system to
people, very often they say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, doing something, taking cannabis
medicine to help my endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like it's some kind of panacea.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can one herb help so many things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I generally explained to them is
that, well, the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_01]: the body's homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the endocannabinoid system is
dysfunctional, well, each of the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: individual systems can start to become
unstable and out of balance and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: experience a host of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your papers, you talk about patients
who are experiencing a low endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: tone are more susceptible to migraines and
then you kind of build on this platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain in detail what you mean
by a patient's endocannabinoid tone and
[SPEAKER_01]: how you believe that is related to the
propensity for them to have migraines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what's an
endocannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be substances that are
similar to THC that naturally occur within
[SPEAKER_00]: our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are of key importance in the brain
in regulating the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers
in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoid tone is a function of
several things simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amounts of the endocannabinoids,
the number and activity of the receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1, where they work, and also the
activity of the enzymes that make and
[SPEAKER_00]: break down the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, endocannabinoid tone is
something that we refer to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, but it's not something we can
easily measure in patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do it directly is with a
cerebral spinal fluid examination by a
[SPEAKER_00]: lumbar puncture or spinal tap,
which is obviously an invasive procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really at the beginning of being
able to do brain imaging to try and assess
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, we know very well at this
point when endocannabinoid levels are low
[SPEAKER_00]: or endocannabinoid tone is diminished,
then a number of things will occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: A person who is affected in this manner is
gonna tend to have pain, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to not sleep well, they're gonna tend
to be nauseated, and then there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole host of other things that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But already, Justin would have mentioned,
you see some commonality with the symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also would apply to other disorders
that seemingly are related, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: fibromyalgia and irritable bowel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've heard you mention in other
conversations, a lot of people end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: all three of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they can occur at the same
time or people with a tendency towards one
[SPEAKER_00]: may manifest the others at some point in
their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can imagine that some folks listening
are like, well, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've spoken before about how many
different ways the modern American life
[SPEAKER_01]: can give it to you from poor sleep,
poor nutrition, environmental toxins,
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals you may be taking,
and then genetic predisposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these repress the body's
creation of these endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it as simple, I mean, it's never as
simple, but when the body's creation of
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids is repressed from these
ways of living, are we thinking that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the lack of these cannabinoids in the body
that allows the balance in these systems
[SPEAKER_01]: to become erratic and therefore allow this
pain to manifest as a migraine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, I believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people who have investigated this
type of thing feel similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some direct evidence at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I wrote the first article length
paper on clinical endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency in 2004, I proposed a study
which I knew couldn't be done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States on just wouldn't have gotten
ethical approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was to examine the cerebrospinal
fluid of migraine sufferers versus people
[SPEAKER_00]: who didn't have it and look for
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, in 2008, a group in Italy,
Sarcheale et al, did exactly that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a tremendous difference in
the level of anandamide, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, in migraineurs versus
control patients that didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first objective proof of
the importance of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system in migraine and the first proof,
again, if you will, of clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency being at the
root of the pathophysiology of migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it interesting that we'll talk
more later about how using cannabis helps
[SPEAKER_01]: with migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the idea that even though we
can't prove that endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency is the cause, the fact that
adding cannabinoids makes it better seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to suggest that that's part of the problem
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a way that we can tease apart the
difference between migraines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by endocannabinoid deficiency
versus migraines that are caused solely by
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's genetic makeup?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine myself being a patient and
going, well, I don't know if I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: doomed because of my DNA or if I should
try cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can't name our parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You choose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm convinced at this point that,
yeah, you can have a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility, but certainly there are
things that people can do to lower their
[SPEAKER_00]: risk, if not totally eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without us getting sidetracked and
going too far down the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency path, I would like to talk a
little bit about the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when patients are explaining to me what
they're looking for relief from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I often will ask them what kind of
lifestyle that they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for folks, they're like, okay,
I recognize that these are the array of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, poor sleep and environmental
toxins and pharmaceuticals and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that that can cause endocannabinoid
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how much is enough to cause the host
of problems that come with endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency like migraines, fibromyalgia,
irritable bowel syndrome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly it's probably not one night's poor
sleep and it's probably not two nights
[SPEAKER_01]: poor sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably some amount of poor sleep
and maybe some amount of environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins and poor nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any kind of guidance that you can
offer for people to kind of figure out if
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be endocannabinoid deficient
since there is no present test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unfortunately, you'll find out when
it's too late, but I would advise the
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine sensitive individual not to go to
a wine and cheese party and stay up all
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be much more likely to
have a hangover, let alone a migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to have an awareness of the
triggers and try to avoid them,
[SPEAKER_00]: not combine them, things of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, there are so many
lifestyle pros that people can pursue that
[SPEAKER_00]: would influence their tendency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically when I saw a patient with
migraine, we not only talked about drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we spent a lot of time talking about life
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended a low impact aerobic
activity program for everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: regular sleep habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these days, I also throw in a pitch
for prebiotics and probiotics to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This probably has a great deal to do with
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tendency to migraine as well as
irritable bowel and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said before on this program that the
gut plays a very significant role in peace
[SPEAKER_01]: of mind, perspective, stress, and so many
other afflictions and symptoms based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the gut biome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who are new to this idea that
they're actually thinking with their
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach, would you give us a nice summary
of it so that the people can hear it,
[SPEAKER_01]: who need to hear it, and research that
continually on their own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our gut, the colon in particular,
just filled with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great deal to do with our
digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What gets absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, there is a gut brain access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these bacteria make
neurotransmitters that get transported to
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increasingly, we have evidence that
they are related to endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just on another subject, we've had
this huge increase in the prevalence of
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly may relate to exactly the
same thing, the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people with these conditions
see improvement and sometimes the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce or eliminate medicines when
they've gotten their microbiome more in
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you had patients in your office
and you were suggesting for them to take
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, I'm curious what you
recommended for them to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of recommendations did you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you make for patients to go buy
off the shelf that might help them start
[SPEAKER_01]: out?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just for context, I left practice in
2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some years prior to that,
I was recommending a book that I still
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend called Nourishing Traditions by
Sally Phelan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it emphasized the anti-inflammatory
diet that was rich in fermented foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be things like yogurt,
kefir, lacto-fermented vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that remains part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these days, there are also supplements
that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can be of two different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're ones mainly based on
lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend single agents,
but it should be one that contains a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different ones, hopefully with
coded names that indicate that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been through clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also spore-based bacilli that
seemingly make it through the gut to the
[SPEAKER_00]: colon where they can sprout and live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, it includes feedstock
for the bacteria that are called
[SPEAKER_00]: prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be foods in the aliaceae,
so your onions, leeks, garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, fibers such as acacia
fiber, burdock root, marshmallow root,
[SPEAKER_00]: things of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of that can be gotten through a
good, very diverse vegetable-based diet
[SPEAKER_00]: with salad greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not iceberg lettuce, but more colored type
greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things of this sort can really go a long
way to improving the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like where we've gotten
ourselves is that we know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine is experiencing migraines and
that there could be this rainbow variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of potential causes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes down to, okay,
we might not be able to point to exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the mechanism for what causes the
migraine, but we do know that intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: and commonality of the migraine is
significantly decreased in most patients
[SPEAKER_01]: by getting regular and routine sleep,
eating a vegetable-rich high-calorie
[SPEAKER_01]: high-probiotic diet, taking a probiotic
supplement, and avoiding triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be a fair assessment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go to commercial,
after the commercial break, we'll start
[SPEAKER_01]: talking specifically about using cannabis
to help with migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody I talked to before this show
said, ask Dr. Russo if migraines can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when they're at their worst,
when their migraine is making them feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like perhaps they'd rather be dead,
they're additionally afraid that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting permanent damage from this
experience as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted to know if there was
actually any threat from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is a very significant source
of morbidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morbidity is a way of saying a burden of
illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with migraine often lose a lot of
time from work and can even be labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: unreliable, particularly if it's a woman
that might get hit with this every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unwarranted, but there's a danger
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tremendous need to lower the
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a variety of attacks so that this
isn't going to impair the ability of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to do their best in their career.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, there are situations
where there's such a strong depression of
[SPEAKER_00]: neural function in the aura that there
could be associated strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with severe migraine may be more
susceptible to cumulative effects that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be deleterious later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it's a really
severe headache with associated symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it's gone and the person has had
a chance to recover, they'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during an attack, yeah, people feel
like they're going to die or they would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with chronic migraine consider
themselves more ill even than chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetics so that there's a very strong
effect on perception of wellness with
[SPEAKER_00]: great implications on lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people with severe migraine
are very avoidant of certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: activities and it can really detract from
enjoyment of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of panic attacks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you've had a panic attack,
most people are all like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're stressed out and anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until you've had a panic attack,
you don't realize that it's a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different color and flavor and category of
its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be very similar to
migraines where, yeah, most people
[SPEAKER_01]: experience a headache at some point in
their lives, but migraines is a category
[SPEAKER_01]: of its own with a much larger and more
impactful set of symptoms that we want
[SPEAKER_01]: relief from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the vast majority of time,
the migraine is not going to cause any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of permanent damage while being an
epic drag, it's not going to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: physical damage except in the rare case
where the person has a stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are listeners who picked
up on that and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about that little aspect a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is there anything that can be taken
during a migraine or on your way up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine that acts as a prophylactic
predictor to having a stroke during the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in cases where a patient with
migraine who presents with weakness on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side that looks like a stroke,
my approach to that in the emergency room
[SPEAKER_00]: was often intravenous magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium has a strong calming influence
on the brain and can abrogate,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop a migraine attack, including one of
these complicated migraine situations or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemiplegic migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemiplegic migraine is weakness on one
side associated with migraine that
[SPEAKER_00]: simulates stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, hopefully the vast majority of
these are not going to culminate in
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were using intravenous magnesium
sulfate in the hospital and that is not an
[SPEAKER_01]: option for most folks having a serious
episode at home, is it at all called for
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick up over-the-counter magnesium
sulfate tablets and to think about taking
[SPEAKER_01]: those orally or is it just a different
mechanism and not the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, close but no cigar in this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium sulfate taken orally doesn't get
absorbed and produces diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone wants to use something orally
as a preventive for migraine, it needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be what's called a chelated magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's C-H-E-L-A-T-E-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's specific, I hesitate to do
this, but there's a specific brand I will
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend called AminoMag, A-M-I-N-O-M-A-G
from Douglas Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had tremendous success with this in my
practice in using that as a preventive for
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite benign drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about 5% of people get diarrhea with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the dosing was one tablet three
times a day, which could be reduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a day if it did produce any gut
upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most forms of magnesium that you'll
find anywhere, magnesium citrate or
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium sulfate, again, are going to
produce diarrhea and not be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you're always very hesitant to
recommend brands because that's not how
[SPEAKER_01]: you roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the level of specificity,
we're looking to actually get people help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you offering that anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_01]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_01]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully and locally sourced,
peat moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_01]: research into the use of recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like peat moss, peat moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_01]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's P-I-T-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: M-O-S-S dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing healthier, more sustainable
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are very particular about the inputs
you use for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like us painstakingly self-educate
on cannabis nutrients and techniques so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can cultivate the best tasting and
cleanest flowers possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we go to purchase those
nutrients, we want to be sure that our
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier shares our values and is
providing exceptional quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend buildasoil.com to
my friends who care about quality.

[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not ready to hire somebody full
time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_01]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to interview you,
implement marketing programs that feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your bottom line, give Blunt Branding a
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the break, Ethan and I were talking
about the actual brain mechanics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraine, and he rethought something that
he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan, why don't you go ahead and make
that clarification that you wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had mentioned the importance of the
substantial migraine and migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: pathophysiology and then I went on to
describe the periaqueductal gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the periaqueductal gray that's the
migraine generator and the substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: nigra probably doesn't enter into it in a
big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, I was thinking of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I had Parkinson's disease on my
mind, but slight correction there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably for the hardcore people
following at home, but that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons why we love to have you here,
Ethan, is that your attention to detail is
[SPEAKER_01]: serious and we know that we can get the
real deal from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all appreciate that correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: During this second set, we're going to
talk less about the nature of migraines
[SPEAKER_01]: and more about the interaction of
cannabinoids and migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really going to be talking as
much about endocannabinoids anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the cannabinoids that the brain
makes itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, we're going to be talking about
cannabinoids that are made outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: body in the cannabis plant that we're
going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that always shocks
people is when they see these classic
[SPEAKER_01]: historical bottles of medicine from the
1800s and early 1900s and they say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they contain cannabis sativa and they're
so shocked that cannabis was prescribed in
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge part of the pharmacopeia until
1942.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you give us a little historical
basis for doctors recommending cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for a range of issues, but in this case,
migraines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got to go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent decades trying to assess the
literature on this and the oldest
[SPEAKER_00]: reference to cannabis for migraine that
I've found dates back 1200 years to
[SPEAKER_00]: Persia, a physician named Sabour Ibn Sal,
and it was particularly interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was one of a variety of
ingredients and it wasn't given as a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, the cannabis in this instance was
instilled in the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is particularly telling for a
couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, drugs that are absorbable
through the nose tend to be pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it's something you can do
when someone's nauseated and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big problems with migraine
is getting medicine in at the time and the
[SPEAKER_00]: intranasal route obviates the need for
trying to give medicine by mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't say anything about how
effective it was, but this guy was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: influential at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, in the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was very influential in Islamic
medicine and then obviously nearby in
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these cultures noted an
association of cannabis for migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we fast forward to 1839 and William
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: O'Shaughnessy was an Irish physician who
in the service of the British Crown went
[SPEAKER_00]: to India, to Calcutta, currently Colcott,
and he was a real genuine scientist of
[SPEAKER_00]: first caliber.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied what the Ayurvedic physicians
were doing and noted the use of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was different to the cannabis that
they had in Europe, which we think of as
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, low level CBD, but this was high
powered THC predominant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he took what he learned from the
Ayurvedic physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did experiments on animals and then
gave it to people for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 1842, he took a trip back to England
and lectured on this and was highly
[SPEAKER_00]: influential in the rapid spread of
cannabis based medicine to the British
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire, to the European continent,
and to North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next year in 1843, a guy named
Clint Denning started using cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat migraine in a series of patients
with excellent results and things just
[SPEAKER_00]: took off from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we examine the 19th century literature,
there were dozens of articles about use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and migraine and it was extremely
interesting because they didn't have MRI
[SPEAKER_00]: scans or CAT scans or EEGs or any of this
technology, but these physicians were
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent observers and they noted two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally have a discrepancy between
the kinds of drugs we used to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two treatment approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are symptomatic treatments that you
take at the time and there are preventive
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, prophylactic treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often these are different drugs,
but in the case of cannabis, it was noted
[SPEAKER_00]: that it worked in both contexts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be used at the time to treat a
migraine attack and certainly as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the fathers of neurology were
very prominent in recommending cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were giants, real intellects,
and their observations have been very much
[SPEAKER_00]: born out to be true over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really was a situation for about a
century that migraine was one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments for migraine was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 1840 and 1940, even the father of
modern medicine, Sir William Osler,
[SPEAKER_00]: said exactly that, that cannabis was the
best treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then prohibition came into play and for
decades we were in the dark about this
[SPEAKER_00]: until things really began to pick up again
in the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to go back to two things that
you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way back, let's start with taking
cannabis through the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I thought I had heard it all and I
had not heard of taking cannabis nasally.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the preparation like that could
be taken through the nose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wish I could tell you exactly,
but as best I could figure, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably raw cannabis and it was probably
THC rather than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, we'd have to say that's
interesting, but THC doesn't pass the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in migraine, it is well known
that there's a breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-brain barrier and it may be a
situation where that is able to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably was some kind of aqueous
solution of cannabis herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to complicate things and to be fair,
this was part of a multiple herb
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so its relative role would be an
extremely difficult thing to assess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in the Middle East
subsequently, it's quite clear that
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish in particular was used to treat
headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for everybody who's listening,
who works with patients and is trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create medicine, the idea of something
being delivered nasally is exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: because we know smoking and oral capsules
and tinctures and rectally and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've done to help patients that have
got different issues, but the nose is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't really recommend it though
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a path that we should consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a little complicated, but usually
we're going to be talking about hypotency
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations as people know very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This either has to be in alcohol or in an
oil and you don't want that stuff in your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really could cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really fight the historical precedent
with a very different preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something I'd recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaving hash up our nose is not what's
called for.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think the closest corollary to this
would be something that is administered
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingually or oral mucosally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, tear or oil base that's
held in the mouth trying to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption through the mucous membranes
there and then it could be swallowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be some
combination of absorption locally and then
[SPEAKER_00]: through the gut, but I really would stay
away from the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we are asking fun questions,
in these old bottles of cannabis sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've seen traveling in the cannabis
museum and such, it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at the ingredients because the
main ingredient is often cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they often also have cocaine and
morphine in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for a laugh, but for a moment
of actuality, is there a reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're aware of why they would put
together cannabis, cocaine, and morphine
[SPEAKER_01]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: While they're certainly abusable drugs,
the cocaine and the morphine, is there
[SPEAKER_01]: some interplay between the three that
makes them very effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sure could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, we don't recommend opioids for
migraine, but it is true that there were a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these combination drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one I like to show in lectures
that combine cannabis with morphine and
[SPEAKER_00]: extract of capsicum, meaning capsaicin,
hot stuff, and chili peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three vegetable origin items
that play on the endogenous pain systems
[SPEAKER_00]: in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It points out why plants are medicine for
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are natural substances from plants
that happen to be closely aligned and
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to endogenous chemicals in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating phenomenon,
and one I always like to throw in the face
[SPEAKER_00]: of skeptics who think that drugs can only
be synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are big on the whole plant
medicine here, so that opinion is popular
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's circle back around now to you had
started down the path of teasing out the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between symptomatic treatment,
meaning treatment for the things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in your body that you want
relief from, and then also secondarily
[SPEAKER_01]: prophylactic, meaning you're less likely
to get the migraine in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the symptoms that we've talked about
so far, photosensitivity, sound
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity, nausea, body discomfort,
cloudy thinking, things like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious if these all are looking at
the same modes of use for cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: their relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when we did the Parkinson
show, we spoke a lot about using full
[SPEAKER_01]: extract ethanol oil and also tinctures
because they built up the cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: the system, they lasted longer,
and you don't often get the attributed
[SPEAKER_01]: high that you get from smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Parkinson's patients, tinctures are
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for migraine folks, is there a
particular method that is most called for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the old literature often refers to
smoking of cannabis, but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily mean it was the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means that that's what's in the
old literature.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where speed is necessary,
there's no doubt that inhalation is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the most expedient method,
but I would amend that to say that it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be by vaporization rather than
smoking for all the obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where speed is of the essence,
if someone has an aura and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: in a situation where they can't have a
crash and burn migraine that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take them out of the action for the rest
of the day, then vaporization is really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the quickest, although
tincture in the mouth may really do the
[SPEAKER_00]: trick as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we've talked about before
suppositories, and I'm really skeptical
[SPEAKER_00]: about them, how applicable they really
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we make a distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone is having regular severe
migraines, it really is a context in which
[SPEAKER_00]: prophylaxis prevention should be at the
top of the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we're recommending suppositories
for somebody who's got a gut issue or they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't keep stuff down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps the only people who would be
having a hard time keeping the tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: down are folks with migraines with the
associated nausea, because I can imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: that they may not want to put high proof
ethanol into their gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may trigger a whole second wave of
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the old school days, we know that
they were using cannabis that had THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't know what other cannabinoids
may have been present.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of research on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas our earlier example was THCA,
so cannabis that has not been
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylated yet, and so it's still in
its acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're talking about vaporization
or inhalation from combustion or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about THC, the non-acid
form, the converted form at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also know nowadays, because we've
got the analytics, that when you are using
[SPEAKER_01]: a melange of cannabinoids, THC,
CBG, CBD, maybe CBN, and maybe even some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the acids mixed together, that when
you've got this wider range of entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, all of these cannabinoids work
together in a way that's more powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: than any one of them on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this platform is all to ask you the
question, do we know which cannabinoids we
[SPEAKER_01]: best want to target at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that THC works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite effectively, and again,
historically, that is what people used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CBD on its own probably is not
going to be adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we hear from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination is always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, we can point to the
ability of CBD to allay THC-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think in the long-term,
the CBD is probably helpful in preventive
[SPEAKER_00]: regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: As to the others, I think what you said is
very true, that having a more complete
[SPEAKER_00]: profile on entourage of substances is
likely helpful in this situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't have a lot of evidence at
this point to say that that's definitively
[SPEAKER_00]: the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dig a little bit more into method
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said vaporization is preferred for
the obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the folks who are new to this,
we'll guess that you are talking because
[SPEAKER_01]: A, inhalation of hot smoke is not the best
for the lungs and irritates the cilia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and vaporization is generally going to
release the cannabinoid compounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in a way that's not scalding to
the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the point you were making?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's true, would you recommend
more vaporization from an extracted oil in
[SPEAKER_01]: a vape pen or directly from the flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as far as medicine goes,
they are subtly different substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really prefer flour in this
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vape pens are going to be
solvent-derived, usually at the expense of
[SPEAKER_00]: a full terpenoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got high THC preparations,
usually pretty devoid of anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the idea in this kind of
treatment is not to render the person
[SPEAKER_00]: extra galactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, low doses are probably
adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, vaporization should be
to the point of symptom reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the pain is less, if the nausea is
less, clearly that's a signal that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, just coupling that with
the usual behaviors of hiding away in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dark, quiet place and trying to get to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully things are going to be a lot
better on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that clarification you made because
essentially we're not talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, getting high from cannabis will help
your migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the, hey, introducing
cannabinoids through vaporization in small
[SPEAKER_01]: doses can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you keep smoking, you're
likely to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really what we're talking about is
micro-dosing, vaped flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, but again, compared to the crash
and burn experience of a full-blown
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine, I'm not saying that getting high
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as in any condition, the lowest dose
that takes care of the symptoms is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not usually necessary to go
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good clarification because
certainly if the goal is to, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: dissociate and go into a dark place and
hold your brain together until it passes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of patients who enjoy taking
a large dose of cannabis so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: more fully check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the dose that they may have
needed to get started with addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: their symptoms may be a small amount,
the amount that they need to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point that it's working may actually be
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is part of the beauty of
cannabis and individualized medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The episode today is to get people
thinking about how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the determination of how much
and in what way to use it is really going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be up to the patient who should start
with low dosages, and a familiar way to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it, and then explore from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was just going to say that,
again, to deal with the other aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, the preventive treatment,
it is always going to be preferable in
[SPEAKER_00]: that instance to go for an oral route of
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone has migraines that are
frequent and severe enough, to warrant
[SPEAKER_00]: daily preventive medication, that should
be taken in a form that's going to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the least likelihood of side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this would be low doses of an agent
that would, say, be taken twice a day as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventive, and hopefully with no great
risk of intoxication that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with the ability to function
optimally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with taking a modern oral cannabis
preparation, we can get a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: specific than we just did with the,
in the moment, you need relief right now
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you're going to have a puff of a
vaporizer or a jointer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to puff something because
it immediately gets into the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas as a prophylactic, you're going to
take a tincture or similar so that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just present in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood so that you don't get it to begin
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of product that's a lot
easier to know what your dosage is versus
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking or vaporizing where it's very
difficult to know the dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, what dosage would
you recommend twice a day as prophylactic
[SPEAKER_01]: care for a migraine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I begin very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I always say in this kind of
situation is, look, you have a chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to get better, but we should
do so slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a premium on avoiding side
effects, a premium on getting this to work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that isn't going to create
problems of its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start very low, 2.5 milligrams of
THC or even less, something that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to produce any level of
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then proceed upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want to use the least amount on
a regular basis that's going to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency and severity of migraine
attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, it might be 2.5 milligrams of
THC equivalent twice a day, less even if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd proceed upwards only as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, that small amount may be
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it'll be five twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, I like to avoid going
higher in preventive situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to see if limiting it to 15
milligrams of THC equivalent a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exceptionally, it could be 30 milligrams,
but beyond that, there's a high likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: that additional medicine isn't really
going to be a lot more effective and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly will add to the likelihood of
getting associated side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as one of the forefathers of the
entourage effect, it's probably important
[SPEAKER_01]: to point out that we're not really talking
about 2.5 milligrams of THC isolate if it
[SPEAKER_01]: can be avoided.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're referring to is THC in the
presence of the rest of the minor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and flavonoids and all the
other components of the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because while we do not understand the
full science yet, the resin complete and
[SPEAKER_01]: not reduced to just THC isolate seems to
work best with the body, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my contention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about on the
prophylactic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that when we inhale cannabis
to deal with our symptoms, that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty darn fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are talking a prophylactic,
decrease the likelihood of a migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going all the way back to Osler,
who you mentioned earlier in 1915 says to
[SPEAKER_01]: expect the treatment to be long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a fast thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you set some kind of expectation that
if a migraineur was to add 2.5 to 5
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of whole plant tincture to
their daily regimen twice a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of results might they see over
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about medicines for
migraine in general, I would use the 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: rule that a lot of things are going to
work in 70% of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that the first two or three
things don't work and the fourth will.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once you start getting into
multiple attempts, the likelihood is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're always still going to have a
hard-core 30% of patients that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take that 30% of resistant
patients and say that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: used the way we've been discussing,
is going to work in 70 to 80% of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is quite likely more
effective than conventional medicines in
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation and seems to work where
other things don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a very high likelihood,
but again, in this context, I didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do things in isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every patient was reminded of the
lifestyle factors that we discussed
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and I think they should all be
done at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's a lot better down the road
and wants to taper off of the preventive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that's great and that would be a
good goal of treatment, but I'd never say
[SPEAKER_00]: start with cannabis without pursuing the
lifestyle adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that someone does start with
cannabis tincture though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that if they're taking it
twice a day, as we've already discussed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they may start experiencing a
reduction in migraines after the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week or is that too fast to expect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it could well be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of this is people find out
whether they're successful or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, it's a tough thing to try to
judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I taking the right dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't know until or unless the next
attack occurs, but again, I would resist
[SPEAKER_00]: the urge to elevate the dose before a
person has to, but in the olden days,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, people were sent out with similar
kinds of instructions on titrating the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose upwards as needed, but ideally,
it's great to check in every week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if a dosage adjustment is
necessary, but many patients figure this
[SPEAKER_00]: out on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a good place for us to
plug the Shaping Fire Sessions series that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did with you that's on the Shaping Fire
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the topics that we discussed was
keeping a patient journal when interacting
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying cannabis for the first time
because when you're self-titrating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're often changing your dosage and
you're set and setting meaning the mood
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in and where you are and who you're
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course, you're going to get
different physiological benefits based on
[SPEAKER_01]: those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've recommended in the past that folks
write this down because over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: even just two weeks, if you're taking it
twice a day and you are having some
[SPEAKER_01]: variability to your dosing, it's so easy
to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last thing I want to get on
the prophylactic aspect is some people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll start cannabis and then they'll
have a migraine and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: damn, it didn't work and then they'll
stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always quick to remind people that
nowhere in the literature does it
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily say that you're going to go
from migraines to zero migraines after a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two of cannabis usage,
that people are heralding huge success
[SPEAKER_01]: with the reduction of the number of
migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak to the importance of not
seeing the solution as being 100% or zero,
[SPEAKER_01]: black or white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better is defined as fewer and less severe
attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone would desire the holy grail of
total absence of attacks and that
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly happens with cannabis-based
treatment, but it's not a reasonable thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to expect straight out of the chute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all hope that that will be the history
that eventuates, but can't promise that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we want there to be fewer,
less severe attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we come back, we are going to talk
about blending cannabis use with
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin mushroom use towards this end
of reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about reducing the
intensity and regularity of your migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stick with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioflux fermented plant booths from
Everflux simplifies organic farming so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can start growing organically today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invented by a California farmer growing
organic for 40 years, bioflux is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented natural farming preparation for
those who want a natural micro booster
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: This extraordinary chemical-free growth
and terpene enhancer improves root
[SPEAKER_01]: development, accelerates the conversion of
organic matter into humus, increases
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient use efficiency and uptake,
and increases beneficial microbe activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the bioflux fermented plant
booster, Everflux also makes an activated
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar called teraflux that is infused
with the bioflux plant booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine combining the buffering and
rhizosphere enhancing qualities of biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: infused with a range of earthworm
castings, insect frass, kelp and crab
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, oyster shell, and other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using teraflux infused biochar this
summer myself and it smells alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich, and potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: These products have been scientifically
proven to match yields and increase flower
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and pest resistance when compared
to traditional NPK inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are looking for reliable organic
fertilizers that will free you up to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on other aspects of your garden,
consider using the range of all-natural
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative fertilizers and natural
biostimulants from Everflux.

[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.

[SPEAKER_01]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery, talking
about breeding cannabis for the best
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative and
polyculture cannabis growing.

[SPEAKER_01]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jeff Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even my own presentation on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is neurologist and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, you know, one of the things
that I find most, you know, interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: about how we're starting to handle
migraines now is the increased
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of I'm going to talk about
the commonality of people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing for a range of neurological
issues, including like we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: on episode 22, using mushrooms and
cannabis together to help heal traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: brain injury and lay down new neural
pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of research that's been
done at this point on mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines because it's a controlled
substance, but there's a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotal evidence that psilocybin
mushrooms help with the relief and to
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease the likelihood of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the state of the science for the
interaction between psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the naturally-accurling molecule,
and mushrooms on migraines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, I think it's helpful to put
this in context historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been known for centuries that
substances that are psychedelic or
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinogenic at high dose can be used at
low doses to treat migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the easiest way to think about it
is in terms of looking at the work of
[SPEAKER_00]: Albert Hofmann, who developed LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually worked for the Sandoz company
in Switzerland on a series of drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: were ergot derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ergot is a rye fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used medicinally for centuries,
but they were using natural compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: semisynthetic from ergot to treat
migraine, both acutely and preventively.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the substances he developed was
LSD, which everyone knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 90s, when I was really getting
into plant-based medicine and alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, my study of migraine began
with forbidden drugs and gradually got
[SPEAKER_00]: into cannabis more specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, historically, peyote,
the source of mescaline, spent a short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time as a prescription medicine
in the United States to treat migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what LSD, psilocybin mushrooms,
and peyote have in common is they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: tryptamine type psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a common mechanism of action
seemingly that relates, as best we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the serotonin type 2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's funny there is we know it works
on this receptor, but why does it
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly have this persistent effect We
usually think of medicines for migraine to
[SPEAKER_00]: have benefit for a few hours or for one
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's different with the psychedelics
is in some individuals, hopefully often,
[SPEAKER_00]: even a low dose of these substances seems
to give a long break to the migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even more pronounced in the
instance of cluster headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cluster headaches are distinct from
migraine, although they may have drugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: common that help them, but clusters are
extremely severe and debilitating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it frequently is the case that someone
uses a very low dose of a psychedelic and
[SPEAKER_00]: has a long-term remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: from cluster headache attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some extent, the same thing can happen
with migraine, but clearly it's the case
[SPEAKER_00]: that these types of substances can be very
effective preventives, even if taken in
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely low doses on a more regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I can brag at this point that I
wrote to Albert Hoffman back in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: and got a handwritten letter from him
endorsing
[SPEAKER_00]: my proposal that super low doses of LSD be
taken preventively as a migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly was related to the kind of work
he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to admit that getting in
another schedule one drug and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop it as a pharmaceutical would be a
little more than I'm willing to take on at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, but certainly that was my
interest back in that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do not know specifically the
mechanism that the psilocybin is
[SPEAKER_01]: performing to interrupt the serotonin
cycle that causes the migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that this interruption is
the thing we want because it acts as a
[SPEAKER_01]: prophylactic against migraines for some
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with that being said, the two
variables that seem to move a lot for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks is the dosage and how long it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the dosage side, we've got folks who
are taking 0.1 gram of a psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom as a microdose, which they won't
experience any of the intoxicating
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, but the chemical is now in their
bloodstream doing its magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people are getting benefits
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you've got other people who don't
get the interruption for long term until
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three milligrams, at which point
that's a very significant dosage of
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin where you are going to have
euphoric and types of hallucinations very
[SPEAKER_01]: likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an intense dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people find that they need to
take that much to get a week or two off of
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are asking me, all the time,
do I take a microdose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to take a heroic dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long should I expect it to last?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I can do is repeat other anecdotal
information that I received from other
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to hear what you have to say
about those two variables, about the dose
[SPEAKER_01]: and how long it works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, I think this is really going
to depend on the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best advice is to start with a
very low dose and see what's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone can take time off of work and
deal with the implications of a heroic
[SPEAKER_00]: dose of a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it would be the case that
less is adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, the kinds of things you were
mentioning seem to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on the type of psilocybin
mushroom that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly with the high potency ones like
psilocybin azoracins, trying to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four mushrooms would likely represent
something like 10 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be that less would be adequate for
prevention of headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams people, hopefully it's going
to be sub threshold for overt psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 milligrams, certainly a good number of
people are going to be affected in that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher than that, it's quite likely
that it's going to be a more full-blown
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, may be more than people
bargained for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important that we state at this time
that these are still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking theoretically here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things may change and it depends on the
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are ballot initiatives to
liberalize the situation in some
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, but these substances remain
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in determining dosage, in common
parlance, when patients are talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, most folks are using weight
measurements of the entire mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that is kind of a misnomer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can have the same species of
mushroom have different potency based on
[SPEAKER_01]: how it was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got different species of
mushrooms that all have got psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: that have got different potency because of
the species that they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to say, ah, I'm taking this much of a
psilocybin mushroom, you try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually, your mileage may vary
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an important warning just to
make sure we mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where I'm going with this is some more
advanced mycologist chemists, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: using natural extraction techniques to
have the psilocybin and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: component, psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds just like psilocybin.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're putting the mushrooms in fluids
that cause these chemicals to precipitate
[SPEAKER_01]: out in their crystalline form,
which is wonderful for many folks because
[SPEAKER_01]: some people have a literal gut reaction to
mushrooms, making their gut upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to have a crystal form
psilocybin and psilocin, you're no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the flesh of the mushroom,
which has these other components that can
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a tummy ache or diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is just set up this
question of, you know, you and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: talked a great deal on shaping fire about
the importance of whole plant cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, where you need to use the
entirety of the flower to get the best
[SPEAKER_01]: medical results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this apply also to mushrooms where we
should be taking the whole mushroom for
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage like results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it really, no, actually,
we're just trying to eat the mushroom to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the psilocybin and the psilocin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can precipitate that out and
take that pure, clearly you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to change your dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by all means, that's going to be a
cleaner way to get access to the chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to ingest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bias would be that more complete
extracts are probably more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that that's proven here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of absolute titration of
dosage or knowing the dosage, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously easier to assess that with a
pure crystalline substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you mentioned, psilocybin isn't the
only game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some species, there's beocysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all psychedelic and may have
similar activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I can't point you to any
established research that can specify
[SPEAKER_00]: major differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do favor natural preparations where
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as dosing for migraines,
there's a lot of teachers out there giving
[SPEAKER_01]: an array of different sorts of dosing
protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people tend to go to the Paul
Stamets dosing protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not necessarily directed
specifically for migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're for general neurological health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some instances, cancer,
specifically if used with turkey,
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, we're talking about
specifically migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is debate about, oh, you're going to
take this small microdose of 0.1 gram of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take it once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take it every day once a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are like, oh, no, you need to
take it every three days, so only two
[SPEAKER_01]: times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of variety on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suspect we're going to end up in a
conversation like we did last set with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, where you start with a little
bit and increase from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything that we want to be
aware of about frequency of taking these
[SPEAKER_01]: microdoses?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to start with a low dose
anyway, just for safety reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: are we going to be wanting to take this
low dose daily, once a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's a good place to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can always move up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to make sure that we've at
least hit the threshold of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you've said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, I guess the best advice
would be to try a low dose, wait a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing happens, then maybe that's
adequate for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always subscribe to the philosophy
that less is more if it's successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if infrequent dosing is sufficient
to achieve the desired end, then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, I would hope that daily
administration isn't necessary the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've discussed in relation to
cannabis as a migraine prophylactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's quite possible that it would be
for some individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking for here is the hope
that there will be some prolonged
[SPEAKER_00]: remission in relation to a certain
frequency of dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my favorite migraineur patients
that I talk to, she takes this very
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously because her migraines are
absolutely debilitating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's the one who first started
talking to me about how effective taking
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin mushrooms are for interrupting
the serotonin cycle caused migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I listened with rapt attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she went so far as to reach out to a
mycologist who cultivates an array of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she got a package from her that was
essentially seven different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin-rich mushrooms from different
parts of the world so that she could kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of taste test them and try low and
medium-sized doses of each to find out if
[SPEAKER_01]: some worked better for her migraine and
would buy her more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for you is she definitely
experienced different lengths without
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines based on the different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that is related only to
the different potency of the psilocybin in
[SPEAKER_01]: each of these species?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that each of the other
species brings things to the table in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to psilocybin, which may be
helping gain her relief from the
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, either is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reductionist is going to say,
oh, it's all related to the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't rule out that there are
synergies occurring in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start talking about the interplay
between psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if our goal is the cessation of
migraines, or at the very least,
[SPEAKER_01]: the decreased likelihood of migraines,
the person with migraines is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, OK, I'm going to start vaporizing
flour in low doses occasionally to,
[SPEAKER_01]: at first, deal with the immediate onset of
a migraine when you can feel it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows of your brain that it's coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, longer term, they're going to
use something like a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we expect any interplay between the
cannabis and the psilocybin mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with two different drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some overlap and effect in this
specific instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious relationship is that many
people use cannabis in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conjunction with psychedelics to reduce
the associated nausea from the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people in the olden days,
it was just a routine to use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: association with the psychedelics just to
avoid the vomiting and nausea that
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently can be associated with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of dosage and what method of
taking the cannabis would you say would
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease the nausea most effectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very low doses would be necessary
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a single inhalation or
something in the range of 2.5 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, if it's just nausea
we're talking about, it's possible that
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA, CBDA could also be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have any anecdotes to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just based on theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because for folks who are
using psilocybin mushrooms for their
[SPEAKER_01]: hallucinogenic qualities, cannabis can
help loosen you up so that you're more
[SPEAKER_01]: open to sacred geometry and the ideas that
people are taking mushrooms for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the goal is not to trip,
if the goal is to do brain maintenance,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really an entirely different
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks who are used to taking mushrooms
and then smoking a joint or some more
[SPEAKER_01]: significant dosage of cannabis do know
that that's not necessary for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily have to get high
even though that might be part of a
[SPEAKER_01]: different kind of therapy of life
enjoyment you may be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's frustrating for
folks, Ethan, is that these therapies
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, which is sometimes even crueler,
they work really well for a little while
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they don't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That frustrates the hell out of patients
who are looking for relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak to whatever facet of the
human body's interaction with these
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals that might explain why they may
work for a little while and then not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, when we're talking about
migraine, it's a complex biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's multifactorial,
particularly with respect to triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not ever satisfied to go with one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I have always imagined my
career harped on combining the lifestyle
[SPEAKER_00]: factors with any pharmaceutical or medical
approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically though, I can say this,
that with cannabis treatment of migraine,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for prevention, it has been
much, much less often that we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's a persistent benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what was noted in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly been my experience in
hearing from people all over the world
[SPEAKER_00]: about their experience using cannabis to
treat migraine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to finish with this last
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you are primarily a researcher
and educator at this point, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: long history of working in the clinic with
real patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all know, there's a big
difference between dealing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: research and actually trying to interact
with a patient who's suffering
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to a patient who is new
to cannabis and new to mushrooms but
[SPEAKER_01]: suffers from terrible migraines?
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient is probably a bit unsure of
the taboo of cannabis and is probably very
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of the taboo and illegality of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pharmaceuticals have let them down by
either not working or working a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: with significant side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as is common in the case,
we don't usually hear from these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients until we're there, where their
last possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of patients who are in
this position listening to us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of guidance or insight do you
offer them to get their head straight
[SPEAKER_01]: about trying these new options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes radical problems require
radical solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's suffered with a
full-blown migraine is aware that they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: try almost anything to make this a less
frequent affliction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, we're facing a situation now
in most jurisdictions that there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: liberalization of attitudes and laws in
relation to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing can happen with
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, either of these approaches with
cannabis or with psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_00]: when used properly can be extremely safe
and offer a kind of relief of migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks that just hasn't been forthcoming
from conventional approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ethan, thank you so much for coming
back to share your insight that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: gained both through your research and from
working with authentically suffering
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it and know your time is
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to having you back
again to talk about another important
[SPEAKER_01]: health issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to find out more about Dr.
Russo's research and read some of his
[SPEAKER_01]: papers that are relevant to this topic,
first of all, I recommend that you check
[SPEAKER_01]: out this episode number 65 on the Shaping
Fire website.
[SPEAKER_01]: At shapingfire.com, you can check out Dr.
Russo's seminal paper, Clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoid Deficiency Reconsidered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current research supports theory in
migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other treatment-resistant syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This paper is just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It explains why so many patients who
experience migraine also are experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: irritable bowel and fibromyalgia,
which if you're unfamiliar with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: think about it like all body aching pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that link and a link to a couple others
is on the shapingfire.com website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I recommend that you check out the
prior Shaping Fire episodes with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's episode 11 and episode 27,
kind of part one and part two,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at cannabis terpenoids and
cannabinoids in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through his two popular papers on
the topic pretty much line by line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also episode 22, where we discuss
TBI and brain injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And treating that with cannabis and
mushrooms as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a burning question that you
want to reach out to ask Dr. Russo
[SPEAKER_01]: directly, you can do that at ethanrusso at
comcast.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be patient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo is a busy cannabis researcher,
and he tries to get back to everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it may take a little bit for him to
have the opportunity to get back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be kind and patient, but you can reach
him there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're interested in the
business science and research side of Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo, you can check out his new business,
Credo Science, and that's at
[SPEAKER_01]: credocredo-science.com.
