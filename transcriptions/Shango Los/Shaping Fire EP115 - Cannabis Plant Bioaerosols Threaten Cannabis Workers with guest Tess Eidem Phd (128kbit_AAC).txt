[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cures and offers relief to humans every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I defend cannabis with
unwavering dedication and heartfelt
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, the truth of the matter is,
is that cannabis can be abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can make some people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those cultivating cannabis can get
really sick by inhaling cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really want to admit it because
so many people condemn cannabis falsely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give them an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, we really do need to look at this
new research because we should push for
[SPEAKER_00]: better cannabis workplace regulations to
keep our friends safe who spend their days
[SPEAKER_00]: growing our beloved cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 115.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Dr. Tess Edam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tess Edam's doctoral research focused on
developing novel antibiotics against
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial pathogens and her scientific
career has centered on bringing modern
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology and RNA biology practices to
promote human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leveraging her scientific expertise,
Dr. Edam transitioned into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where she spent four years
working directly in cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: and quality management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unique experience allowed her to
combine her hands-on skills in
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing with microbiology and
product safety as a preventative,
[SPEAKER_00]: controls-qualified individual to help
cannabis cultivators minimize potential
[SPEAKER_00]: hazards within their facilities and in
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having witnessed firsthand the challenges
of microbial contamination in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, Dr. Edam returned to the
University of Colorado Boulder where she
[SPEAKER_00]: currently works as a senior research
scientist in the Aerobiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: Disinfection Laboratory with a focus on
practical building science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her research investigates bioaerosol
persistence associated with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: environments including airborne molds,
allergens, and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's driven to connect unbiased
scientific research with environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering principles and applying them
to the cannabis space to improve worker
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being, plant health, and consumer
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the short first set, we will
discuss the nature of bioaerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the longer second set, we will discuss
the threat matrix of cannabis bioaerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look at the various sources of
fungal, bacterial, and viral bioaerosols
[SPEAKER_00]: and determine their threat levels to
cannabis workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will finish the episode considering
actions that cannabis folk can use to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves safe and mitigation actions
employers and regulators can implement to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease bioaerosol risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Tess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between simply
smelling cannabis and enjoying those
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatics like we all do versus inhaling
bioaerosols that can be harmful when in
[SPEAKER_00]: volume?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the aroma that comes off of the
cannabis flower when you're breathing that
[SPEAKER_01]: in, it's a lot of the vapors, so a lot of
the gases that come off of the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your volatile organic compounds,
your VOCs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll mostly be terpenes and esters and
give those kind of classic aroma,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, gassy, diesel, you know,
fruity types of aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: While when you're breathing in
bioaerosols, it's not just the gases that
[SPEAKER_01]: are present, but there's actually small
particles floating around in the air that
[SPEAKER_01]: may contain biological materials,
at least in part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be coming from
microorganisms in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be coming from the plant matter
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be from the substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be from humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different things that
can be floating around in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that are actually bioaerosols
in addition to those vapors that give
[SPEAKER_01]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would those vapors that give the
aromas, would those also be a subset of
[SPEAKER_00]: bioaerosols?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not the bioaerosols that
we're concerned about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they not actually considered
bioaerosols because they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: airborne particulate matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great question, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the definition of an aerosol is it's
got to have that physical mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a solid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not in gaseous phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those aerosols are the particulate
matter, while VOCs are going to be in gas
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like, for example,
a difference would be when it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: humid out, that's water in its vapor
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to spray you with a
spritzer, that little spritzer is
[SPEAKER_01]: generating tiny little aerosols of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like tiny little droplets of water,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference between an
aerosol and a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense why it would
potentially injure the human body a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more because the gas will be more easily
gotten rid of by our human system than
[SPEAKER_00]: little chunks of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use the scientific terms, chunks of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to C-O-S the chunks of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to make acronyms in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, VOCs can be potentially
harmful, especially at high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to be pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different VOCs is like grouping in
tons of different organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some may be at higher levels,
tend to be more irritants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it comes into contact with your
skin, you know, some people don't if you
[SPEAKER_01]: get contact with like essential oils,
most essential oils are actually terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that can irritate people's
skin or it can be soothing to some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really just depends on a person's
sensitization to those different compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and the specific compounds that are part
of those VOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the introduction to this show,
you know, I pointed out for folks that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are really on the cutting edge of this
science and that the research here is just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, I'm going to be asking
you to theorize some as the expert to help
[SPEAKER_00]: give us context.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to ask about is,
you know, how are these harms theoretical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as people who work in the cannabis
industry, I mean, I know that when I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants, when a lot of them touch
my skin over the course of a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get, you know, a rash or hives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I know my human does have a reaction
to the plant sometimes in ways that are
[SPEAKER_00]: less pleasant because those hives are a
real drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, I've got lots of
friends who work in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but who don't complain about the kinds of
issues that are in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these harms more theoretical that they
could happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we already seeing them in people
who work in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are seeing it in you know,
the limited reports that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do have that contact dermatitis or
you know, they develop hives from touching
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you'll usually see people wear
like sleeves during harvest to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: their arms from that contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be the result of a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be irritants from that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be developing allergies,
which is a little less understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the respiratory
exposures, which can also be harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even though there's not a
lot of data out there in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space, we know based on parallels in other
industries, other agricultural settings,
[SPEAKER_01]: that these agricultural dusts and those
environments can generate potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful aerosols or bio aerosols that
especially over the course of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: repeated exposures, some people tend to,
you know, genetics plays a role in this
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some folks may be more sensitized to
some of these agents in the air for all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the reasons why I think it's
not as investigated in the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: is because the cannabis industry is
really, relatively pretty new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, here in my home state of
Colorado, it's been recreationally legal
[SPEAKER_01]: since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have like 10,
maybe 20 years of data of like looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these bio aerosols, but most of
the recent reports have been within the
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with, you know,
employees having adverse events at work to
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the air in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there is a not insignificant
number of people who are not reporting as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how can the how can the
science capture the incidences if the
[SPEAKER_00]: employee doesn't report it or if the
employer doesn't report it or if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to report it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your research, what are some of the
main reasons you have found that under
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, my answer will be
pretty speculative, but from my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, you know, a lot of these
cannabis companies because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating and manufacturing cannabis is
still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of this concept that,
you know, federal oversight on employee
[SPEAKER_01]: health standards and employee safety don't
apply to these cannabis companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like OSHA, OSHA regulations or the
Occupational Safety and Health
[SPEAKER_01]: Administration, their standards and their
regulations still apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these cannabis operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there's just in
general, there's a kind of a stigma
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding cannabis in general,
you know, from reporting it to your doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: that you use it to reporting incidents at
work, especially some of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unlike getting run over by a forklift or
something like that, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these maybe repeated motions that
that are pretty typical of a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing and cultivation
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having adverse events like respiratory
distress is not as well understood and not
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone experiences it exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because, you know, some people may
experience it, other people in that exact
[SPEAKER_01]: same environment may not experience like
shortness of breath or wheezing or other
[SPEAKER_01]: respiratory issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may feel like it might be in their
head or something's wrong with them or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they just don't want to be
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, at least officially,
and so they may not report it to their
[SPEAKER_01]: internal safety manager if they have one
or to like, you know, their state OSHA or
[SPEAKER_01]: NIOSH representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the second set, we're going to talk
more about the specific threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, are these bio
aerosols and the impact on the humans who
[SPEAKER_00]: work there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that really only impacts
those working in manufacturing commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities of cannabis or or might these
fungal spores and bacteria and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: materials be at a high enough density in a
cannabis patient's home greenhouse or in
[SPEAKER_00]: their basement, say of like 20 or let's
say 15 to 25 plants, which might be
[SPEAKER_00]: typical of of a patient, regardless of
what the law says that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fairly typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, could these bio aerosols exist
at that low of a density or does it really
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be scaled commercial growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that this scaling,
you know, just like anything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: scaling also your problem scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that it's probably more
likely that these, you know, the diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: and the amount of bio aerosols in some of
these indoor commercial operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially those that are retrofitted
buildings or maybe have improper HVAC
[SPEAKER_01]: design and implementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably are going to see much higher
levels of bio aerosols in those
[SPEAKER_01]: environments just because of the sheer
number of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all, you know, transpiring and
putting in moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the materials in those spaces may not
be suitable for the high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: warm temperature conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you probably are seeing it more in
those environments, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation and then maybe slightly
different bio aerosols on the processing
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you're grinding,
you know, 50 pounds of flour a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably are going to be exposed to a
lot more of these bio aerosols than when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just grinding up, you know,
a pound that you harvested, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of weeks ago and you're now
trimming or grinding at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really does depend and it depends on
your unique home environment as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really controlling the temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do notice that you have
respiratory distress when you're handling
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter, especially dried plant
matter, then I would just say at home to
[SPEAKER_01]: wear like a respirator, like an N95,
you know, we're all pretty familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: these things since COVID, but that will
help to prevent being exposed to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those potential particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for goodness sakes, if you're doing
this at home, well, also at work,
[SPEAKER_00]: use a HEPA filter for goodness sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got a patient organization
here on Vashon Island where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least until COVID, prior to COVID,
we would all get together every fall and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've got that many people with
that many plants from different places,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people would find themselves
sneezing and they're like, I don't sneeze
[SPEAKER_00]: around my own plants, you know,
but everybody's growing in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just those very basic things like
masking and gloves and a HEPA filter for
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who, well, not only do you want to
use it for people who are sensitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really good to use that stuff
even if you're not sensitive yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: because so many people get, become
sensitive from repeat usage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's listening to the show,
and they're feeling cocky, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's none of this at my work
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you might not just be
sensitive yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely develop allergies,
just like with anything else in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you may not have allergies to
gluten when you're young, but as you get
[SPEAKER_01]: older, you might develop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true for cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can develop allergies against
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also potentially different molds
that could be on the product or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that could exacerbate that,
or you could potentially be allergic to
[SPEAKER_01]: those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not very well understood,
but there is evidence that you can become
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitized to specific protein allergens
from the cannabis plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit on an answer you gave a
little earlier about the web of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can imagine that the web of
regulation regarding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis bioaerosols is a total mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since cannabis is still legal at the
federal level, you've got some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal agencies that are not regulating
it because it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got other federal agencies
like OSHA that are still encouraging,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, employee protection at these
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got the states who are
trying to normalize, like I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are trying to regulate it at
some level, creating this patchwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anything effective about this
patchwork?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we moving in the right direction or is
it just going to be a mess until federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do think that the legal status of
cannabis definitely makes it more
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to provide baseline data and
just the basic research to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what's floating around in these diverse
indoor environments, maybe even mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: environments like greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the process of cannabis
cultivation and dry curing is pretty
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty uniform every grow I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's slight variance on how
each grower does it, but the process is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the environments in which those are
grown in are usually very different from
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to old tuna factories that are
now cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to like state of the art,
like built in Japan and then shipped over
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been into all these different types
of settings for cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can also change the bio
aerosols that are in those environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in general, bio aerosols in
indoor environments, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, university indoor
settings, like I'm at right now to home
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, home settings to other
manufacturing settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not that much that's like really
understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely not standards that
are set by some of these, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: occupations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, there are definitely
standards set for different pollutants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different gases, formaldehyde in
the air, ozone in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for aerosols and bio aerosols,
it's not the correlation between exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: and disease is much more challenging to
establish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of these organizations just
don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have standards that are
regulations on the amount of bio aerosols
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be found in an indoor
environment, any indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately that, that is
compounding the challenges that we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis space is that we just don't
have many standards to protect people from
[SPEAKER_01]: high bio aerosol loads in these built
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which all just makes the case for science
like you're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can take more action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's wrap up this first set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, during the second set, which will be
our, by far our biggest set today,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about the,
the threat matrix of all these various bio
[SPEAKER_00]: aerosols and how they act independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure to come back after the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is microbiologist test
Edam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these advertisers shaping fire
would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the award
winning cannabis seeds that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical breeding program of Seth and
Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the revolution seeds at GTR seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds has a new THC V line with plants
like double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one THC to THC V and people want
that THC V.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_00]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_00]: buck than commercials on shaping fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneratively minded cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on shaping fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now,
and will continue to reach new listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: as they explore the shaping fire back
catalog of episodes again and again for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on shaping fire costs less than a
postcard per person, and the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: audience is full of smart cannabis
enthusiasts, cultivators, and
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in the new year,
we are booking the few open spots we have
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for you to be one of our new
advertisers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is microbiologist,
Test Edem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we talked mostly
about the framework, what bioaerosols are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the real harm that's happening to
folks in cannabis, and the fact that there
[SPEAKER_00]: really isn't any good research on this
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this preliminary, and like,
not preliminary, but this original
[SPEAKER_00]: research that we're talking about today is
shining a light on something that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be looked at much more closely long-term
for our friends who work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tess, you know, during the first set,
we talked about bioaerosols that are
[SPEAKER_00]: created during cannabis cultivation,
and we gave a definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are these bioaerosols that we
want to be so aware of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so with COVID, I think more folks
are a little bit more educated on this
[SPEAKER_01]: just with a baseline understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times when we think of
bioaerosols, we think of these intact
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got intact viruses or intact
bacteria or intact, like, mold spores that
[SPEAKER_01]: are floating around either, you know,
from like a moldy part of the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're in, and they're releasing
those spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it could be generated when,
let's say, you're watering or there's
[SPEAKER_01]: aerosolization of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water that contains some of these
microorganisms or, you know, in disease
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission, we talk about a lot the
aerosols that are created when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to each other, breathing normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of that can generate
bioaerosols in an environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the cannabis space, there has been
some research that's been done to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get an understanding of what's
actually floating around in the air when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to these biological organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from an industrial hygiene
perspective, a lot of times what people
[SPEAKER_01]: will do is they'll go into facilities and
they'll sample, you know, they'll take a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain volume of air and they'll do a lot
of counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll count the number of mold spores
and try to bend them into different groups
[SPEAKER_01]: of molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll take that air sample and
they'll culture it on petri dishes and be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get a number of viable
microorganisms or colony forming units,
[SPEAKER_01]: CFU, which might sound familiar to those
folks who know anything about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: CFU is also used to enumerate viable
microbes on the cannabis flower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CFU of microorganisms can be in
the air as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think about those intact
microorganisms, those viable
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, and then there's also
their breakdown products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can secrete into the environment
different metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can break down over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these micro bits and pieces can end
up being in the air, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: part of these agricultural dusts that may
settle, but then become more airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: during, you know, normal work environment
conditions and activities in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those microbial metabolites can
include different types of toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can include just immune activators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your immune system over billions of years
has really developed a way to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's foreign, especially if
it's bacterial or fungal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's not me and I'm going to
mount a response at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's these other different
types of protein components that typically
[SPEAKER_01]: are what we call allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those activate a different branch of
the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we get, you know,
the stereotypical allergies from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when there's a lot of pollen in
the air or if you're allergic to cats or
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs and you go into somebody's house and
they have cats, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing in sort of, you know,
the protein allergens from those cats and
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can also be present,
not necessarily cats and dogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: although I have seen a dog in a grow
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, from any molds that are in
that environment, they can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: produce lots of different types of
allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis plant itself can also
produce different allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of the, you know,
it spreads the entire spectrum from these
[SPEAKER_01]: intact organisms, some of which may be
harmful and pathogenic, and then all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down to breakdown products or bits and
pieces or metabolites that can also be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to shine our light for a
moment on the measurement standard CFU,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, when you were
originally answering the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking about intact fungal
spores and such, and I was thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does she mean about intact?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, it probably relates to
CFU, which didn't really mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really grok it very well until I
read your paper, because I think there was
[SPEAKER_00]: something about the new fear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I'm talking with folks about
cannabis testing and they talk about CFU,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really seem like a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I read your paper and I read
about CFU, and for those of you who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it totally sounds like alien invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, like in the cultivation
space, there are these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these fungal spores and different biology
that are floating around and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and they could form colonies and I'm
breathing them in and that seems super
[SPEAKER_00]: creepy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it really kind of shines
a light on our conversation in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way, which I think that people could make
this conversation kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectualized and get really into just
the data and not realize that really we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about like one variety of living
biology coming in contact with another
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of living biology being us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, how are these two biologies
gonna interact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they, you know, is our immune system
just gonna squash them or are they gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: like ruin our whole week or longer by,
you know, forming these colonies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we refer to in the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just add that to make these
microbiology sized living organisms seem
[SPEAKER_00]: more real because as soon as you start
talking about CFU, it really gives them a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more of an aggressive personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they're alive, you know,
because when you look at a comparison,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you, if I were to take a set volume
of air and look at that air that I
[SPEAKER_01]: collected either on a filter or there's
lots of different ways to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: biological particulate from the air that
will, you know, preserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that impaction can kill
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta, your collection method is
really important when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate certain, especially viable
microorganisms in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're pulling that out of the
air, if I were to look at mold spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, I could count the number of
mold spores, but not all those mold spores
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually gonna turn into a viable
colony forming unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like how when you're growing
plants, not all your seeds germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really actually a pretty low
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 1% of mold spores will actually
like sporulate into a viable colony
[SPEAKER_01]: forming unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get a slightly different
answer, but those mold spores could still
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially be harmful, even though
they're not alive because of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial metabolites that could be on
those spores or associated with them like
[SPEAKER_01]: allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even if they are alive,
they may not really be harmful to most
[SPEAKER_01]: people if they're not pathogens,
meaning they don't really cause disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the capability to really
infect a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not, they may be a pathogen,
but maybe they're not very good at being
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted through the route of
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some microorganisms are better at,
you know, being breathed in and being
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred from one person to another,
like many viruses are transferred that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Legionnaire's disease,
that's bacterium that can be transferred
[SPEAKER_01]: in the air and spread disease,
usually from water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's, so some microorganisms
just aren't really good at being
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted by disease through the air,
but those that are could potentially be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful, especially to a subset of people
who may have a compromised immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you do have an immune system,
a resident immune system in your lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an immunologist, but my co-author,
Tara Nordgren, who helped me with the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She actually studies lung immunology,
especially in response to agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these viable pathogens could
potentially be harmful to those folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: are immune compromised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you may see like,
you know, in particular aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: fumigatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a world-held organization,
critical priority fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could potentially, if it's in the air,
which it's very common in the air in many
[SPEAKER_01]: different environments, if you are a
particularly sensitive person or have a
[SPEAKER_01]: compromised immune system, there could be
a chance that exposure could result in
[SPEAKER_01]: some type of aspergillus related disease,
which can come in a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors from aspergillosis, which is that
active fungal infection of the lung,
[SPEAKER_01]: to different hypersensitivities to
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that has to do with exposure to
those allergens.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to that part of the study
where it lists all of the Latin names of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the things that could go wrong with
you, it does seem like a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, are you threatening
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, none of these things
are things that I want to get from my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for most people,
when they say, oh, there can be things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air, in the grow, most people are just
assuming that these are things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: drifting off of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really remarkable to me to read
all of the different sources that you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, like, there's at least eight or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to go through them all,
but would you review, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a handful of them for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I'm hoping to get out of this
question is people to have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of all the different places
that bio aerosols that could threaten them
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that paper, there's a figure that
just kind of shows the, the general
[SPEAKER_01]: process of cultivation, dry cure and the
manufacturing processing side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at each point in the process,
there's likely different bio aerosols
[SPEAKER_01]: being generated from different sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can include the substrate that
you're working with, like cocoa core or
[SPEAKER_01]: even rock wall could potentially generate
different bio aerosols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertigation, irrigation system,
the HVAC system, even moldy walls or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, standing water could potentially
result in some of these bio aerosols.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using beneficial microorganisms
or any even beneficial, like predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: mites or other insects, you know,
insect allergies are pretty common and
[SPEAKER_01]: people who work, there's actually been
documentation of developing allergies
[SPEAKER_01]: towards some of these insects and
arachnids that are used in these
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along the entire process,
you know, when you transition over from
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation into dry cure and really
particularly in manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the bio aerosol that's going to be
generated are likely going to be from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially in those handling and
trimming and grinding of dried plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material, that's when you start seeing
more and more of the bio aerosols being
[SPEAKER_01]: composed of that plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shaping fire, we tend to lean towards
regenerative growing topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not, we're not very into salt
growing in A plus B here and in even
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor and sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend towards that direction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm hearing from you is that
certainly while some of the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants or chemical issues that we
might inhale might go away, most of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you're talking about is biology
and sounds like it would be just as
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable to a regeneratively minded grow
as it would a full on chemical hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these biological components are
going to be present in lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways of growing and cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm definitely a believer of
regenerative farming and agriculture as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as, you know, I love microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they definitely can help in
the grow, beneficials, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about kind of understanding what is
in the air and monitoring that and
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling that so that, you know,
you're really minimizing exposure because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about exposure and the frequency
exposure, the amount that you're exposed
[SPEAKER_01]: and your genetic predisposition that's
going to ultimately result in whether or
[SPEAKER_01]: not you have a negative health outcome
because of some of these exposures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people who work in agriculture
over time, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Nebraska, where I'm from originally,
and where a lot of this research is being
[SPEAKER_01]: done at my alma mater at University of
Nebraska Medical Center, people who work
[SPEAKER_01]: in these agricultural industries tend not
to want to wear masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they don't, you know,
that, that kind of last engineering
[SPEAKER_01]: control that you can put in place,
that, that mask over your face to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: you is not, you know, the kind of culture
there is I'm not going to wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's fine, except for you're
being exposed to some of these dusts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're being exposed to some of these
other elements that could be in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that can translate over
into cannabis as well as you may be
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed, but you don't know, you know,
what's really in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think doing some basic monitoring
can be really helpful so that you can kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of gauge, well, do I really have anything
to worry about or are our levels pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, relatively low from the few kind
of standards that are out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it more in line with like a post
hurricane building that's had flood damage
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like, I've got mold spore levels
like in line with some of these remediated
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of trying to gauge that for
yourself, really requires you to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a look at what's floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is kind of a sidebar,
but this whole idea of wearing masks while
[SPEAKER_00]: doing agriculture is still relatively new
to me, but it was really run home for me
[SPEAKER_00]: about, it's been about a month ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down in Oxnard doing some bio
remediation consulting for soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biologists, Leighton Morrison,
who's been on the show a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was down there, we were,
we were working with this fancy new
[SPEAKER_00]: compost recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was staying at his house,
my asthma just was like terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and because I was being a smart
aleck, I was, I was blaming the local
[SPEAKER_00]: flour that I picked up at a dispensary in
Oxnard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, man, you're missing the
bigger point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the heart of old school petroleum
agriculture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, I didn't think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we jumped in the car and we drove
around and he just showed me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thousands and thousands of acres
that were all over tilled and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrition lists and micro bliss and,
and was all dusty and blowing in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, this is the air that you're
breathing at my house, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh my gosh, like I didn't,
you know, we're, we're only like three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four blocks from these fields,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and he described all the weird things
that happens in his yard because of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that they spray just a couple
blocks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started thinking to myself,
well, when I, when I visit him,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really isn't good for, for my asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I, then we go for a drive and I
see all of these workers who are there
[SPEAKER_00]: working in the fields right there with all
this dust blowing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's filled with traditional
petroleum, you know, pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really drove the idea home of why
people in agriculture should be wearing
masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's man, it's, it makes me think of like,
like the other traditional industries
[SPEAKER_00]: where you trade your body for work,
like, like coal mining, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that was, you know, in coal
mining and black lung and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that's not necessarily exposure to
bio aerosols, but these tiny particles
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically can, can physically cause
damage here long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that mounts an immune response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which then can restructure your lung
physiology, and that can lead to disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a different pathway, but you get
some similar end results, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: COPD, hyper, what's the last one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypersensitive pneumonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there's a lot of different,
there's a lot of different, your lungs can
[SPEAKER_01]: be hurt in lots of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be biological.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be physical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the, anytime there's a lot of
particulate in the air, it's, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: generally a good idea to wear,
like an N95 respirator, just to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself from just the sheer amount that
you're breathing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your lungs can, you know,
kind of clean that out for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're really, really fine
particles, and this is really the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the important part when it comes to a
health perspective, really fine
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate matter that's below about 2.5
microns can go deep down into the lungs
[SPEAKER_01]: and even be directly absorbed into the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yes, those can cause different
pulmonary diseases over time, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: also linked to other systemic disease that
a lot of times doesn't get as much
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, there are several
publications out showing that exposure,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially to these fine particulate
matter species can lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: neurodegenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is less well understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's definitely a whole body
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not just your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're really small, they can get into
your bloodstream, travel to different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's repeated exposure over a long
period of time can lead to a diverse set
[SPEAKER_01]: of pathologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the part of the paper that really
caught my attention was the different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes of these particulates, the,
the, the top being say 10 micron,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then going down to the 2.5 micron that
you mentioned, the smaller they get,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more dangerous they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of us are kind of like,
you know, ah, you got to cut, just throw
[SPEAKER_00]: some mud on it and let's go, you know,
kind of like, like, like, let's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily respect the damage that has
been done to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes way more sneaky when we're
talking about inhaling things that are sub
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 micron, because we don't know what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very likely that since we don't
know that it's happening at work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we may blame it on, you know, our house or
our bedsheets or our spouse's fragrance or
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things, when it's actually
happening at work, it's, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: an invisible threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the size of these particles is
really, it's impactful from a health
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, but also from just an aerosol
science perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smaller the particles are,
the longer they can stay floating around
[SPEAKER_01]: in the air as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you, could you breathe them
in and they go deeper into your lungs,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're likely going to be more
sustained exposure hazards, because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be floating around in the
air for longer periods of time before
[SPEAKER_01]: gravity pulls them down and they deposit
onto the ground or onto the walls or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever these particles end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called deposition in aerosol science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they end up falling essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bigger particles, usually,
you know, over 10 microns, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will go up in the air and fall right
back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But smaller, you know, around 10 microns
and smaller, they tend to stay in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: for minutes or even hours depending on how
small they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only from a health perspective,
but also from a building science
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, the size of the particulates,
including their composition, are really
[SPEAKER_01]: important when you're trying to understand
the impacts that these different particles
[SPEAKER_01]: can have on workers or on other folks in
indoor environments in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is that,
you know, the EPA, the Environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: Protection Agency, OSHA and indoor air
quality standards are all kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: they look at these particles slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though we're all trying to
look at these particles and assess how
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be harmful, there's different
binning of sizes and which categories may
[SPEAKER_01]: be most harmful, depending on if you're
looking at an environmental health
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, an occupational health
perspective, or just an indoor air quality
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to have these
three kind of different but overlapping
[SPEAKER_01]: fields trying to assess these bio
aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really troubling as a regenerative
farmer who loves microbes to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes as any kind of an enemy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like we wear t-shirts,
you know, I love microbes and microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and all this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the microbes and we're usually
spending our time like incubating them to
[SPEAKER_00]: create more of them to pour into the
substrate to feed the soil so the soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet your paper talks about these
pathogenic microbes and they are a human
[SPEAKER_00]: threat in our environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obvious, duh, that it's true,
but it's also troubling that this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: biology that we are in such support of
also can be threat if they are of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic variety to a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm a big fan of microbes
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love fermented foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think that microbes,
you know, they created the planet that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're on today and I appreciate that and
love them for that, but they can also,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very small subset of them can directly
cause disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of some microbes don't
necessarily have to be pathogens to be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, some of their just their
basic components, their metabolites can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually trigger certain immune responses,
even though those microorganisms wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily infect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the amount and the types of
metabolites that they present could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially be harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tess, your research also focuses in on
microbial metabolites like endotoxin that
[SPEAKER_00]: just pound our immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study research suggests that this
is very common when we are grinding flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who's ever been in that
environment knows that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the material is getting ground,
it kind of just like permeates the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room and if the doors are open,
it can go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unfortunately, as much as they're
supposed to have good HVAC in these
[SPEAKER_00]: places, many of them don't, especially in
states that are just becoming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis normalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about this
endotoxin that is carried by the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets ground down into pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So endotoxin is actually found on
gram-negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you remember your basic micro 101,
there's two different basically groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and they're sort of organized by
their cell walls and their cell membrane
[SPEAKER_01]: and how that's organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gram-negative bacteria have something
called endotoxin or LPS,
[SPEAKER_01]: lipopolysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so flour that would have, you know,
high levels of bacteria on them could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially have a lot of endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really no peer-reviewed
research studying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know that gram-negative
bacteria can definitely be on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's likely that LPS or endotoxin is on
cannabis flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some white papers out there
that have shown and identified endotoxin
[SPEAKER_01]: on cannabis flour that's commercial within
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal Genomics, I think, put out that
white paper last year showing that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: identify endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: On cannabis flour that is commercially
available to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in that report that came out
about that fatal occupational asthma
[SPEAKER_01]: attack in Massachusetts of a cannabis
worker, the OSHA investigators went in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they did some air sampling and they did
find levels were elevated during,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grinding operations in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that company had implemented HEPA
filtration after the worker suffered that
[SPEAKER_01]: fatal occupational asthma attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not clear what the levels
would have been that she would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that could potentially,
and it doesn't have, there's really no
[SPEAKER_01]: established OSHA standards for the amount
of endotoxin that, you know, someone can
[SPEAKER_01]: be exposed to quote unquote safely over an
eight hour waited period.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no OSHA standard for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go off of other countries sort
of limits to kind of gauge what is a
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially harmful level, but that level
is not going to be the same for every
[SPEAKER_01]: individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potentially harmful events could happen
at very low endotoxin levels for folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: may be particularly sensitive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the handful of studies that look
at endotoxin in different cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp environments, the levels in cannabis
environments, and granted, this is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe three to five papers that
have come out on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very small in scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not super high in cannabis
operations, but they were very high in
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be just the difference
between growing indoor versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be how these operations are
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have just been the luck of the
draw, you know, roll the dice and some
[SPEAKER_01]: will be higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some will be low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the sample size is very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is definitely more, it warrants a
lot more investigation on what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: endotoxin levels are actually in the air
during, especially during processing of
[SPEAKER_01]: these dry flowered products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to end this set talking about bio
aerosol synergies, because you make this
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting point during the, on the,
during the paper of that, there are these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these various fungal bacteria
and viral bio aerosols, and they all kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of impact humans in different ways,
but oh yeah, when they get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: party in your immune system, like it can
cause something entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you speak briefly to these,
these synergies and how, when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when these different aerosols work
together, they, they can be made all the
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone who studies biology knows it's
usually not like A plus or A to B to C,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually these, these very
interesting relationships and feed forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and feedback pathways and interactions
between different, you know, biological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes that can create end results that
you don't expect based on what went into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, some of these bio
aerosols can definitely synergize with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, endotoxin can synergize with
other toxins and exacerbate different
[SPEAKER_01]: negative health outcomes and you can see
enhanced sensitization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that, that's that kind of
classic IgE mediated, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: allergen, that's that branch of the immune
system that really focuses on those
[SPEAKER_01]: protein allergens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're allergic to other plants that
have similar proteins to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can actually sensitize you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you can have a greater likelihood
of becoming allergic to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the growers that I talk to,
who are sensitized, because I do know
[SPEAKER_01]: several who are, will say that when
there's a lot of pollen outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: they actually notice that their allergies
inside the grow are worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not clear why that is or what's
going on there, but it's likely that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some cross sensitization that's
going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these bio aerosols have complex
relationships and that's why it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: important to not only just be like,
okay, these are the number of particles in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air and the sizes that they are,
but taking a deeper dive into what
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms are there, what metabolites are
there, what allergens are there,
[SPEAKER_01]: what toxins are there, and really
understanding how the diverse bio aerosol
[SPEAKER_01]: ohm, because we love to add ohm to
everything in science, could be leading to
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these potential effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, drawing that causal relationship
between exposure to a particular group of
[SPEAKER_01]: different bio aerosols and disease is very
challenging, again, because there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different things in the air,
the amount that's there and the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're exposed, plus your own genetic
predisposition is going to play a big role
[SPEAKER_01]: in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's known that these aerosols and
just the different components of these bio
[SPEAKER_01]: aerosols can interact with each other and
really exacerbate negative health
[SPEAKER_01]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great net test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this isn't really, really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really awful, but your explanation
is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's go ahead and take a short
break and be right back with the third
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is microbiologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Test Edam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspecta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle is a breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were here on Vashon Island and
everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up to date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is microbiologist Tess
Edem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Tess, you know, some of these
bioaerosols end up in concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which are then inhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it primarily inhaled products like dab
oil that are at risk of passing on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these toxins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we find an ingestion risk in
ethanol-extracted full extract oils like
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO or crude or something like that that's
going to be eaten?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with the way... So these
bioaerosols are generated in these
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis environments, but the organisms
can also be on the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it can also settle from the
environment onto the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could carry over onto the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really interesting that you
bring up concentrates because some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these, like endotoxin, some of these
microbial metabolites are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: fat-soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, they would carry over with a
pretty hydrophobic molecule like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, THC and THCA and CBD and CBDA
during these different types of extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, especially if you're using
organic solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, will they end up being intact and
able to cause harm in an individual?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, there's no... For some of
these sites, there's really no testing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like endotoxin, which is again part of
those bacterial cell membranes,
[SPEAKER_01]: or there's other types of cell membranes
from fungi that contain beta-glucans,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can also cause harm when breathed
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another component of bioaerosols.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lot of fungal contamination,
will those carry over onto your extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are not really being studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for compliance testing, it's not
required to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really no R&D being
performed in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, mycotoxins could potentially carry
over and concentrate, but we only really
[SPEAKER_01]: test for a handful of mycotoxins,
mostly that are produced by aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: and penicillium species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't test for other types of
toxins that are produced by plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens like fusarium, which could
potentially include some pretty severe
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't test for that, so we just
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big black box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it could potentially carry over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we're really
interested in from both the concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: During combustion or during drier
vaporization of flower, are these
[SPEAKER_01]: biological components destroyed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're heating up to like 400 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you're vaporizing at like 180 C or 150
C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you going to destroy those
biological components, or is it going to
[SPEAKER_01]: just aerosolize them and generate new
bioaerosols that now contain these
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially bioactive agents?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has really done any research on
that in cannabis, but there is research
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been done on tobacco that has
shown that endotoxin can carry over into
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some scientists do hypothesize that
that endotoxin that is now in bioaerosols
[SPEAKER_01]: generated during combustion contributes to
some of these lung diseases that we see in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis smokers, especially those that
are more inflammatory based, like COPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not clear in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one paper that was published in
the 80s that showed that aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: spores could carry over in a cannabis
joint into the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly it doesn't, and they were
viable at the very end, so they could form
[SPEAKER_01]: a colony forming unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's clear that these biological
components can transfer over from flower
[SPEAKER_01]: into smoke, but we just don't know the
extent of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how much of it carries over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it 0.0001% of what's on the flower it
carries over, or is it a much bigger chunk
[SPEAKER_01]: than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really no research being done
on that as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an academic researcher at a
federally funded institution,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, even if cannabis is
rescheduled to a schedule three drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if I had a DEA schedule one or
schedule three license, I still can't go
[SPEAKER_01]: out and pick up commercial cannabis from
my state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't walk down the street to one
of the many dispensaries in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab flower and bring it back to my
federally funded lab because that is
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I have a DEA schedule license,
I can only source cannabis from a DEA
[SPEAKER_01]: registered NIDA producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not representative of the stuff
that's actually being sold at retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for academic researchers who
want to ask these questions, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can only study, you know, University of
Mississippi flower, and I think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe six or seven other approved vendors
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a consumer safety perspective,
that is very frustrating because I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's on that flower and I want to
know what carries over into smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the concentrate side,
we really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some work that's done on like the
heavy metals that can be generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when pesticides are combusted,
like how what does that result in?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some work on that, especially in
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on concentrates, there's really not
that much that's understood about the
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse different types of microbial
metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in there outside of,
you know, the five or so mycotoxins that
[SPEAKER_01]: are tested for as part of regulatory
measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of different mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's endotoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of other bits and pieces
that we're not really looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that's an area of
research that really needs funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has to be some leeway there for
researchers to be able to actually study
[SPEAKER_01]: product that's out on the market that
people are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for as popular as dabbing is,
it is amazing that this research hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people that could
potentially be at very serious risk and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tess, I want to end with these two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of the two is, you know,
we've talked a lot about the threat that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis workers are under at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for cannabis
workers who do work in an indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: environment on what they should do best to
protect themselves because they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they love working in cannabis
and they feel that, you know, working in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a meaningful role to play,
but we don't want them to be putting
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves at risk to be a participant in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what actions should they take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think that, you know,
if a cannabis worker is noticing that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are having, you know, shortness of breath
while they're working or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know probably a dozen folks who've
had these types of respiratory issues when
[SPEAKER_01]: working with plant that they should
definitely talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a safety officer internally,
they should talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should talk to the supervisor and
they should also go to the doctor and be
[SPEAKER_01]: referred to an allergist and see if they
have allergies to cannabis or mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's very challenging to get
these cannabis extracts, to do like skin
[SPEAKER_01]: prick tests on folks in different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very challenging to be able to
determine if you do have allergies towards
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because of the federally illegal
status even of these cannabis extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: that are used for skin prick tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would recommend, you know,
really making sure that you are bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: your concerns to your supervisors,
to your safety officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you are wearing an N95.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do notice you have that respiratory
distress and really try to figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is that could be leading to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least go to an allergist and do some
basic skin prick tests to see if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: have any sensitization to anything that
could be in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because, yeah, I mean, there was one
study that NIOSH conducted on these 10
[SPEAKER_01]: workers in the state of Washington and
they followed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had different occupational asthma
related issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was over the course of a
year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this NIOSH study followed these
workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, unfortunately,
all 10 workers ended up having to quit
[SPEAKER_01]: their jobs because they couldn't do the
work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you could ask to be reassigned to
a different job duty, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting worse and worse, if you want to
stay in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, once you develop a
sensitization or you know, you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: exposures, sometimes if you develop that,
it stays with you the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really sounds like people should be
wearing the N95s, even if they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: having a trouble yet, since you're saying
that it's acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if somebody loves working in
cannabis, it sounds like they should start
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing a mask even when they don't have a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't develop a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely couldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of masking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely couldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing they could do is start
advocating for basic indoor air quality
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very low cost monitors that can,
they won't tell you what's in the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'll tell you how many particles of
different sizes are in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can monitor like VOCs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also monitor temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can network those and get kind of
like an internet of things going and real
[SPEAKER_01]: time monitoring up and running to evaluate
the air quality in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also good for other important
parameters like temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you also want to be dialed in for
your grow anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another way that a company can
start looking at their air quality and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in additional filtration,
making sure that they're really getting
[SPEAKER_01]: what's recommended as far as air exchange
rates per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making sure that they're taking some
of these engineering controls too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mask is great, but it's really that last
kind of line of defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other things that you can do in
the hierarchy of controls to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: workers in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good air filtration, making sure you're
getting your air exchange rates up there
[SPEAKER_01]: and monitoring those environments can be
really helpful so that you're avoiding
[SPEAKER_01]: these high levels so that you don't
necessarily have to wear a mask because
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're controlling those at the
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short-term solutions for cannabis workers
and longer-term solutions for managers of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis facilities who want to keep their
employees safe while not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: overspending.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it and that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tess, thank you so much for joining us
today here on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is an easy topic for you as a
scientist, I think that those of us who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been in love with cannabis for years
and are so used to defending cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the haters that we never want to say
that there's any thing bad or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after doing this for as long as I
have, I have to say, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can be a threat and we have to
stay aware of it, even though it may also
[SPEAKER_00]: be a sacred plant to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I understand that this is an opinion
here, but it also is not lost on me that
[SPEAKER_00]: the harms from cannabis come from a,
indoor growing, where regenerative is so
[SPEAKER_00]: often outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, this is all worse at scale when we
all tend to love craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not saying that large scale
indoor can't be grown in a safe way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am saying that, gosh, it does seem
to be a bit more evidence for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tess, thank you so much for sharing
your experience and your insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you for being willing to
give us a little bit of theorizing mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: in with your hard data so that here at the
beginning of this kind of research,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can understand what the data might be
meaning better than just the raw data
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been a wonderful guest.
