[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, you know, you've spoken for
years about your vision of the future
[SPEAKER_01]: where people are growing specialty chemo
bars that are being grown with a terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: mix and a cannabinoid mix that are
specifically for different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that with a little bit of time and a
lot of effort, we would be able to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: these custom cultivars for these different
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the cannabis industry right
now is kind of going in another way at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, which is moving towards
distillates and terpenes and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them together in kind of a
cocktail and trying to customize cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for patients that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who I know is very much into
whole plant, what are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get to those goals of customized
cannabis medicine through isolates inside
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of through growing whole plants in
one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to me, that approach is a little bit
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear that the cannabis plant has a
very plastic genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of saying that you can make
it do anything if you take the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: selectively breed it for specific
components and combinations that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been amply demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, we have the situation now
where many people are producing CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might use a hemp source, for example,
and they realize that on the world market,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get $40 a gram for this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that many patients with a
severe seizure disorder would go through
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been amply demonstrated that CBD
alone although it's a great medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: severe epilepsy, for schizophrenia,
we can do the same thing, probably a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better with much lower doses of CBD when
it's in combination with its other natural
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, let's say, the other components
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of THC with a bigger
amount of CBD is good for very many
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was recently a meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a situation in which someone
reviews the literature and crunches all
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers from multiple studies together
to create an overall impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fabrizio Pamplona did this in relation
to a comparison between CBD as a pure drug
[SPEAKER_00]: versus CBD as an extract in treatment of
severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was that although there
could be comparable levels of efficacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would work for seizures about the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doses required for the CBD extracts
with other components included were about
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% of what was required with CBD alone
and the side effects were much lower
[SPEAKER_00]: because at very, very high doses in
combination with other drugs, CBD can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce some drug-drug interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you just don't see at the lower doses
when it's a whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the situation of using
either a pure cannabinoid or a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and then adding terpenoids from an
outside source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really against this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's often done with synthetic
terpenoids from a chemical producer that
[SPEAKER_00]: were never designed for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be 95% pure, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 5% is important, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what it is and what its
potential toxicity could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we don't know that it's
going to be the same stereoisomer that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules have three-dimensional
structures and if it's turned the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: way, if it's the mirror image,
it can have a totally different effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can smell different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have different effects in the brain
or other parts of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realize what people are trying to do
with this, but to me it's vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: preferable to take the time and
selectively breed cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: components and proportions that you wish
to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about people using isolates
and putting them together to try to reach
[SPEAKER_01]: a clinical goal with a patient,
it feels like analog versus digital music
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, where if you're taking one part
this terpene, one part THC, one part a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of different minor cannabinoids and
put them together, you're getting these
[SPEAKER_01]: zeros and ones, but with analog music,
when you're putting a needle on a record,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get all of the depth of it instead of
just the composite of the pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an appropriate way to think about
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of digital music,
but with respect to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's my considered opinion that a properly
constituted extract is going to beat these
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, if we're talking about
development of a pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be from one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're combining species that becomes a
combination medicine, and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably tripling or more the work because
you have to do toxicology analysis on each
[SPEAKER_00]: component separately and then all of them
together and it becomes cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that we were talking about
using these isolates as a bridge because
[SPEAKER_01]: these custom chemovars don't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me finish my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can see someone watching thinking
to myself, well, in the short term,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna use terpenes and isolates
together until we grow these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, A, can that do more
damage than help the patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: And B, if you know where these plants are,
what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the problem is that yes,
these plants exist, but in a very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: journey, in jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, some of these types of
chemovars that I'm describing were
[SPEAKER_00]: available in California and in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not generally available
because our federal laws prohibit these
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing state borders, let alone
international borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first thing that needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in favor of combining external
synthetics as a stopgap measure because
[SPEAKER_00]: again, these are potentially toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amounts used may not be proper at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not a proper approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are using isolates and
terpenes to try to have this bridge until
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants are more accessible,
is there a way for them to know when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're reaching threshold points that
could be toxic, like offering terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that it's pretty well
regarded that because we've had the
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with the cannabis plant for
so long, and it generally moves slowly in
[SPEAKER_01]: its changes, that we continually are
checking in with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if we grab a bunch of isolate and
we put it together, we haven't had a long,
[SPEAKER_01]: long relationship with that particular
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we put ourselves at more risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should keep in mind what the
relative concentrations would be under
[SPEAKER_00]: natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have total cannabinoids in the
20% or 25% range, many of the chemovars
[SPEAKER_00]: only still have about 1% or 2% terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5%, which I've seen, is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get to the point that it's a
five-to-one ratio of cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people certainly shouldn't be exceeding
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, they need to keep in mind that too
much of a good thing is really possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take the example of alpha pionene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pionene is a bronchodilator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens up the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there's too much, it's irritating
to the lungs and can have a reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, say, in someone who's asthmatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of alpha pionene will
counteract the short-term memory
[SPEAKER_00]: impairment that THC produces, but too much
potentially could be too stimulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors, which is the activity that
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha pionene produces, boosts memory and
lowers low amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the dose is excessive, they could
make it more likely for someone to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, alpha pionene has toxicity
if the dose is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing would apply to any
other terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example would be essential oils,
which are combinations of terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential oil of lavender is okay to place
on the skin, what's called using neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody has a burn and puts
lavender essential oil, that'll help with
[SPEAKER_00]: the burn and it won't be bad for the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many other essential oils would
be caustic if applied directly to the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: on produced burning or other reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really worry about safety in relation
to these kinds of practices if people are
[SPEAKER_00]: not being cognizant of the proper
proportion or the need to go slowly with
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to learn more about this,
we actually have got a link to Dr. Russo's
[SPEAKER_01]: paper on this topic in the first comment
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dr. Russo.
Thank you, Dr. Russo.
