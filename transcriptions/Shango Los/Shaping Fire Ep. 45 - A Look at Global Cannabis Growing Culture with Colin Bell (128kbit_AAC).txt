[SPEAKER_00]: Weed used to be just a local thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was essentially your pot dealer and
your friends you smoked it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has taken its boot off everyone's neck
regarding prohibition, weed and pot has
[SPEAKER_00]: become cannabis and is now a global
business phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Countries are trading back and forth,
and the ancillary businesses to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: are stretching out to become global
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brave new world has many of us flying
around the world to make the connections
[SPEAKER_00]: and spread cannabis friendship everywhere
we can fly to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we extend a friendly hand to
cannabis enthusiasts around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get to learn their traditions and
cultures around this most amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, business and technique efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good cheer, I encourage you to

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Colin Bell,
co-founder of mammoth microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was kind enough to bring this
month's prize packs with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin isn't here to talk about their
products though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here to talk about the cultural
experiences he has had and the kind folks
[SPEAKER_00]: he has met during the last two years
traveling to nearly every continent to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up mammoth microbe as a global business.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the show today, we're going to talk
about the different approaches to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in different countries,
what it's like trying to evangelize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in countries that still have
prohibition, and how no matter where you
[SPEAKER_00]: go in the world, cannabis people become
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become fast friends, even if you
don't speak the same language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, my friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad that you would be able to spend
some time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you are a busy cat and
watching your Instagram over the last 18
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you seem to be traveling
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I caught you in your office
for once so that we could have this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start right off at the top about
the different areas of the globe that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have been to make new cannabis friends in
the last year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from watching your Instagram that
you were really interested in how
[SPEAKER_00]: different regions of the globe had
different, I guess we call them legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: growing styles, and it was different from
place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you go ahead and tell us a little
bit about that, about how the growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: done differently in different parts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start by saying I have an
awesome job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an awesome company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being the co-founder allows me to get
a great team on the ground and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: engage with the cannabis community on a
global scale, not only to outreach the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, but to develop our global
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our cultures and core competencies
and core values is developing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to do that around the world,
within this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm getting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And saying that, you know, we started our
global footprint campaign to get microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: used across the world in this cannabis
industry just a short year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been successful in traveling
through UK and many different places in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and Israel and Australia and
countries through South America and the
[SPEAKER_01]: education and support and brought our
product to these countries and have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: great adoption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been quite the journey and quite
the education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have such a different perspective on the
world as I engage people in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: in these different countries, in these
different cultures within our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the growing styles, as you mentioned,
are vastly different from these different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give the example of our neighbors in
South America as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some economic constraints to the
products and the technologies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: available in some of those countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the styles of growing and the
culture of using nature and using soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: being organic and organically oriented,
I will say, has really shaped the way
[SPEAKER_01]: these growers grow cannabis in South
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Uruguay and Colombia are excellent
examples where there aren't as many inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: used and there's more natural additives
that are being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have one of my partners as
an example in Uruguay, Irugró Juan.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, my man?
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a study that just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our partner, our distribution
partner, one of the great stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: Irugró in Montevideo, Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did it controlled side by side using
completely organic natural substrates in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same room as a hydroponic system,
same strain, same climate, same light,
[SPEAKER_01]: same everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the room was hydroponic mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the room was organic completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same strain of plants looked
completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tasted completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mindset through much of South
America and the world for that matter now
[SPEAKER_01]: is focused not only on yield but
maximizing and enhancing the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant, meaning the smell and the
flavors that this plant can give off
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terpenes and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I like to characterize some of
those environments is organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor-y or merging organics into the
indoor grows much more so than in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and the UK, where it's heavy mineral,
heavy indoor, to focusing, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK, on strictly deep water culture
hydroponics, where organics are not used
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're just now, the concept of
organics is just now starting to emerge
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the acknowledgement of enhanced
plant quality when using organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for the microbes also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in South America, we can say very
open to organics, nature, type inputs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, in UK, and even somewhat in
Australia where we do a lot of business,
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of microbes is somewhat new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a process, an education process,
and that's what I engage in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let growers understand how we can
bridge natural processes into these
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional mineral growing practices and
still enhance not only yields but maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant's phenotypic potential so they
can get the quality that the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually bred for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting that South
America would have such an organic base
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of provides proof that you can
do quality organic plantings without a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of expensive inputs simply by using
compost teas and local amendments because
[SPEAKER_00]: the people there have not traditionally
had the economic wherewithal to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: afford the expensive Western fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you compare that to the UK,
which obviously is very affluent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they moved towards hydroponics and
all these mineral-based bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the thing that affluent farmers
were using, but now we're kind of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: reconsideration of bottled nutrients as a
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the folks throughout Europe are
starting to look more towards what people
[SPEAKER_00]: will often describe as simple or organic,
but anybody who's ever studied KNF knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can get complex really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's interesting how the level
of affluence directly impacts the style of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good way to
characterize it and it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's intuitive if it's been told to
you, but it was kind of a surprise as I
[SPEAKER_01]: was engaging in these different areas and
these cannabis growers and just learning
[SPEAKER_01]: how they're growing and the focus on that
too, Shing, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the UK is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call it the quest for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a year ago, the idea was growers are
basically focused on the yield because in
[SPEAKER_01]: these darker colored markets, so to speak,
the black markets, the gray markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I love the term black
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it's a pretty common
term, but where the regulatory pressure is
[SPEAKER_01]: more less developed or there's not
regulation and people are kind of working
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath some of the legalities to get
this plant in the hands of consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant typically has a higher value
because there's that extra level of risk
[SPEAKER_01]: and people really focus on yield in those
particular markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically that's just been
absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw everything at the plant that you
possibly can to get the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so like lots of PGRs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just recently started to turn
around where it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good example too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was at Spanibus last year and I'd
already engaged with a lot of growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK by then for the first quarter of
the year in 2018 and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: March 2018 when our team was in Spanibus
and I was there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of UK growers go there also and many
came to me at our booth and they showed me
[SPEAKER_01]: these flowers and they're very concerned
because they're super dense, super rock
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would ask, man, do you think this
has PGRs in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have any flavor, the smell was off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concern was that it's unhealthy
and it definitely wasn't appealing to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The harsh, I don't know if you've ever
experienced that where you kind of get the
[SPEAKER_01]: harsh throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think everyone's experienced that
at least once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the consumers want to get away from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this quest for quality, not only in
terms of better growing practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the genetics, has just skyrocketed
in that market and in other markets
[SPEAKER_01]: through Europe because of the influence of
the US to a large degree over the last 12
[SPEAKER_01]: and 24 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now everyone obviously still wants
to maximize the yield in their crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everyone also really needs to maximize
the quality to distinguish themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that through that quest for
quality through Amsterdam, through Spain,
[SPEAKER_01]: through UK, through Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think is fascinating also is
different areas have some kind of endemic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, genetic that seems to persist
through all the different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amnesia Hayes is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you engage with the shops in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Amsterdam was basically the
cornerstone of the cannabis industry for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the center of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a center of activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gotten a lot of criticism
recently because the diversity is not
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the data that I've gathered from
hearing a lot of people talk about what
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get and the genetics are kind of
constrained and more so through UK and
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam and Spain and everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus on Colorado and even more so
California genetics is dominates every
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation and it dominates the pricing
of flour also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in many cases through those different
regions, if you have California genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get double the price of your flour
that you can from like genetics that were
[SPEAKER_01]: just inherent from those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wow, so many things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I want to hit on is
that it's interesting because Barney's
[SPEAKER_00]: farm genetics and such are still remain
popular here in the US because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: less common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those can sometimes get a premium
price for European genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also saying that the opposite
is also true that we've got such talented
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders here in the United States that
people who have stable lives, those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and then they find their way to
Europe, that's getting the premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I want to hit on that
is, you know, you said, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of this, let's say demand for bag
appeal and terpene profile instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: raw weight, raw yield is because of
American influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you that to a large degree,
it's because of Instagram too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've all like, you know,
since we were all kids, we've all been
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced by high times magazines and the
centerfolds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly high times magazine does not
have the level of influence compared to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Instagram breeders as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find that a lot of people were
coming up to you with questions or wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you things and everybody was going
to Instagram profiles back and forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pretty new thing, you know,
because of the state of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in these different countries,
people are very low key in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's changed just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK, people have been low key
forever and not very many people until
[SPEAKER_01]: this last 12, you know, within the last
two years have really started to even
[SPEAKER_01]: engage in Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, it's just the platform
that everyone goes to to educate
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves on the different breeders,
the different strains that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a lot of exchange that
occurs on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a side note, but,
you know, there's a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising their flowers on that
platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually watching U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram heritage or black market sellers
is hysterical because some people are not
[SPEAKER_00]: even they're not even trying to be subtle
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a it's kind of a fun
pastime to watch those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier on, you mentioned that,
you know, a lot of the technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers were not available in South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were doing it, you know,
down home organic style, the way they've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown their other food, just because they
can't afford the fancy mineral stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, we're kind of turning
away from anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I bet you that also goes in almost all
of the countries that you talked about for
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these people are kind of like like the
United States was five years ago before we
[SPEAKER_00]: had cannabis labs all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these people are kind of breeding
and growing and purchasing blind because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody can really tell, you know,
potency and pesticides and PGRs,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things that that we commonly
test for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those those just don't exist everywhere
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, it's nonexistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's no cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being there's no investment that's
being put into those verticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: To think about how much we've evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we talk about, you know,
the genetics coming from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do we know about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can actually collect the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the freedom to operate,
to do proper breeding, to do proper
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and to answer those questions with
high confidence to for for further
[SPEAKER_01]: selection of breeding generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you know what you're breeding
if you can't test it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you do know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really not been well informed
except for, you know, the visuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually try product
afterwards and see how those plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: responding and how well you like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the level of confidence for breeding
and actually creating genetics has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And European genetics has been a
powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just amazed me two years ago when I
was introduced to the European genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: world, I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can buy three seeds for
forty dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about the redefining what a money
tree looks like just from a genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that has quickly evolved in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as industries evolve, one of the
questions I get because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from Colorado and being in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then engaging in all these marketing
markets where legalization is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's happening pretty quickly,
but the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is leading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like the guy that's supposed to
have this crystal ball that says,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what does this look like for us
two or three or four years or what does
[SPEAKER_01]: this look like for us after legalization
happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I can be a resource for
these folks in different countries to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer those questions, because there's a
pretty high confidence that we know what
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like as growing becomes legal,
as flower and other THC consumable
[SPEAKER_01]: products become regulated, the economics
and supply and demand play into effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can affect the whole value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really fun to kind of shed
some light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing that I do often.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest questions I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does this look like when our country
becomes legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of those questions also and one
of those details is, well, when regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: happens, so does testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's coming across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when cannabis enthusiasts
come to events, if there's somebody there
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're all excited to see,
you know, like a major breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a mean gene or a celebrity like a
Tommy Chong or a Snoop Dogg or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis enthusiasts who are
growing at home, they'll bring like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a bag or something of their best
stuff to give to their hero, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think that for you being a,
you know, a cannabis research scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: and an American, which is, you know,
kind of exotic in some of these places,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to these events,
some of these people are bringing you
[SPEAKER_00]: those bags, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna show you what they grew and got
your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is the range of stuff that you
saw?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, were you seeing great stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, you know, crappy PGR,
laden stuff, or just give us a snapshot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of stuff that people are showing
you and actually probably giving you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I love my job, I'm just gonna
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons I love my job is
because everywhere I go, and this is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a layered question.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love to share and to show the wares
of their productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do get gifted a lot of flour
across the world, no matter where.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, forget about the states,
in the UK, through Spain, Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Latin America, and it's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say is that there's a little
bias, because now we've been a company for
[SPEAKER_01]: about three years, and mammoth,
our technology mammoth is used in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: places, and people are giving me
mammoth-grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's not, it's like,
hey, I used your product to grow this,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there's a little bit of a bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I'm getting mammoth-grown
product everywhere, and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably told you this story before,
I can't go anywhere for a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: much less two weeks, without having a huge
lunch pail full of different bud from
[SPEAKER_01]: different growers at the hydro shops and
other growers that I'm working with and
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a fun exercise, and
regionally, it's just completely across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board, different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of chronic and bread strains
through Spain, because inherently that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is grown in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amnesia hay stuff, you can taste it in
almost everything grown through the
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some different strains that are
just very, very well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheeses is an example of the UK,
and they're starting to get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some other strains that are just
kind of inherent for the Australia market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen probably more organic and
probably less potent strains the further
[SPEAKER_01]: south we move in the Americas,
towards South America, through Columbia,
[SPEAKER_01]: as an example, where there'll be some
expert growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Peru's an example, they had their
first cannabis cup, and as an emerging
[SPEAKER_01]: market, there hasn't been the education,
and education is key to maximizing
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge and capabilities to grow
high quality strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in Peru, there's a lot of room for
growers to improve, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: room to also get better genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia's another example where there's
not gonna be as high quality, generally,
[SPEAKER_01]: of flour in Columbia as there would be in
Colorado or California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say to preface it, I had my South
American team come up for our holiday
[SPEAKER_01]: party and sales training in December,
and we just toured through South America
[SPEAKER_01]: just before that in November, in that
first part of December, and I took them to
[SPEAKER_01]: some dispensers into a cultivation
facility, a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facility in Denver, and a dispenser here
in Fort Collins, Colorado, and it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best flour they'd ever seen, and the best
flour they'd ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been engaged in the industry
their whole lives, and the range of ages
[SPEAKER_01]: was from 25 to 35 years old, a bunch of
young men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, they've engaged in
the South American markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two more things I wanna hit on before
we break for our first commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give you an opportunity to tell
the bridal story, which I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting, and then after that,
would you go into the, we haven't hit on
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia yet, and you've got some interesting
stuff to say about Asian-growing co-ops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, so for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm honored to be, again,
able to engage professionally in what I
[SPEAKER_01]: do, which is just engage with growers,
trying to bring them value, and what I get
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere I go is a lot of hugs,
and I love that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the shows we were at in
Columbia and met Gene, a young man,
[SPEAKER_01]: and having talked to him some on
Instagram, et cetera, and he had some
[SPEAKER_01]: product, and he was a grower, and he was
using mammoth, and it was a really
[SPEAKER_01]: charming story where he told me he felt
like our product, after he started using
[SPEAKER_01]: it, he felt like his plants were getting
married because they got so frosty that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like they were putting on a nice white
wedding gown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes to show to the increased
quality that he was experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the same strengths he's been growing
for a long time, just by incorporating our
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial technologies to enhance nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a culturally relevant example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not something that you'd
get from an American, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In South America, where, I don't know,
the whole kind of wedding culture is more
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated, I don't know, differently than
here, I think that is, it's very poetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very poetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moved me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to tell that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, as you know,
too, everyone is so passionate in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can help someone, especially in
this industry, you've just made a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we do is try to create value and
provide solutions for cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 100% of our focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so, you know, we're just
creating friends all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's finish up first, Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break us down a little bit about aging
growing co-ops and recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that was new,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can imagine, I was first really
exposed to this in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I moved to Europe and Australia in
particular, it's apparent that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: different cultural groups that move into
areas to dominate the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Asian groups, there's Russian
groups, there's Armenian groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's Polish groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on who has the stronghold,
it's kind of an organized situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take chunks of the market to control
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's Asian Vietnamese groups that
have done this for years and have been
[SPEAKER_01]: very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've developed, and what I
understand is there's main families that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of control the global Asian growing
throughout the world, where they have
[SPEAKER_01]: families in Canada and in UK and in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very interesting and a very hard
nut to crack to actually get them to adopt
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's many, many different grows
that one family might control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one recipe that they all have
to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a language barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to a certain amount of stores
where there's a language barrier where
[SPEAKER_01]: they only deal with their own kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me to try and get in and learn
more about this growing, it's been pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens is they follow the same
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to get on that list has been
quite the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these main families, especially in
Australia, have acknowledged our efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: in trying to allow, to bring these
technologies, our technology, to get
[SPEAKER_01]: better yields and better quality,
which is typically known as, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, they call it the brown,
which is like hit with every PGR known to
[SPEAKER_01]: mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what the tourists buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the locals are like, don't get the
brown, don't get the brown, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these Asian groups have picked
up mammoth because it allows them to get
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that stigma of the brown and to
improve the quality of their grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just the structure of how different
groups are growing and where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: organized and located has been quite the
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of these vertically
integrated Asian growing co-ops that have
[SPEAKER_00]: got, loosely I'll say family, but they've
got these vertical families set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're part of this growing
vertical, you use the same recipes as
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else in the clan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like a cultural
franchise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your whole family you've got all
these different locations, but you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it the same way because it's what
you've decided works and decreases your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing risk the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that they've got something
like that without formal contracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just the way it's always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that very culturally interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually very important to
understand that from a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes down to the very unique detail
of even packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a blueprint of what the bottle
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the color bottle they're gonna
buy with the color label and the color
[SPEAKER_01]: caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been cases when I've known
without going into names, a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: that decided to change the color of their
caps, their closures to blue where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to stop, the growers stopped
buying it because they were supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy that product that had the white caps,
not the blue caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't get it through to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So note to manufacturers out there,
packaging matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't change packaging if you don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cause more problems than bring
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good argument to take more time
developing your packaging at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to make a change at the
end of year one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is all great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take our first short
break and break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Colin Bell, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to implement these biological
solutions, real science education is
[SPEAKER_00]: vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing, you will probably want
[SPEAKER_00]: to attend the upcoming Science of Organic
Regenerative Cannabis Cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua Rutherford of Dutch Blooms has
lined up an incredible array of educators
[SPEAKER_00]: for the traveling event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff includes Leighton
Morrison and Elaine Ingham on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, Chris Trump talking Korean
natural farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, Kelly and Josh from Dragonfly
Earth Medicine, Suzanne Wainwright,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bug lady, Dr. Robert Faust on natural
bio-stimulants, Steven Reisner on
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics, and Chip Osborne on soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more folks will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a grower panel, a breeding
panel, and a Dem certified farmers panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua has even built in significant
informal time for you with the teachers as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no advertising at the event,
no vendor booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tuition is what is paying the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will all be very present and
attentive to you, not a corporate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better, the conference is not just
for folks on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt California is hosting one event
for sure, but the show is going on the
[SPEAKER_00]: road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine, and Ann Arbor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out your pen now because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized top shelf soil educators all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intensive for people like us
who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find a link on the shaping
fire Instagram and newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb Inspector and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirate
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit Humboldt
CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Humboldt CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Colin Bell, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about the differences in growing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and culture across Europe and
Australia and Latin America and Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of what you have been doing
during the last year and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin, is essentially evangelizing living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the same changes that have been
happening in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as prohibition starts to recede.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are able to talk more online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're being able to visit analytics labs
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are starting to rely on
synthetics less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially your job when you went
over there was to meet people and create
[SPEAKER_00]: community and kind of encourage people to
use soil more and to stop putting PGRs and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals in their stuff just for their
own health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about,
you know, what it's like to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to essentially start over on a new
kind of growing technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you told us in the first set that
Europe was very much, especially the U.K.,
[SPEAKER_00]: was very much into hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no, I think maybe you
should, you know, get rid of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've done up to this point and
start in this, you know, in this new way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did people react to your message as a
living soil evangelist?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start by saying, you know,
I have a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: in microbiology and I feel like I've been
a living soil evangelist for my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life, at least my whole academic career.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't a very good one until I was
able to actually apply some of my academic
[SPEAKER_01]: training into the market where I could
engage farmers more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, of course, we know and science
has well supported that the national
[SPEAKER_01]: natural processes that occur in soil that
are facilitated by soil microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: both bacteria and fungi, do support plant
health, plant development and plant yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: No questions asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also know that the interactions between
chemistry and cultivation, although we do
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver nutrients to plants using chemical
fertilizers and they're in layoff forms,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are missing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that whenever we can
incorporate some of the nature back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the rhizosphere or the plant root zone and
nurture those exchanges, those plant
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial exchanges that have evolved
since the beginning of time, the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to it favorably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we bring the natural exchange
back to them to allow them to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: their potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also say that I've talked to hundreds
and hundreds of farmers in many crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers don't like to change anything no
matter what they're farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is quite a steep hill to
climb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking about that, we have to
understand how to bridge the gap of nature
[SPEAKER_01]: or natural technologies like using
microbes, like using living soil into
[SPEAKER_01]: existing management practices without
having to ask the farmer to change
[SPEAKER_01]: everything because that could be a very
long adoption cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you approach them,
what are you finding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm trying, I'm about to take
your entire global experience from the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two years and bring it down to one
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, when you meet
these people, are they hungry for the new
[SPEAKER_00]: organic knowledge where they're all like,
explain it to me five ways so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it in my language or are they,
you know, you are a farming colonist,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you're trying to change our
ways for no good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I approach it a little
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's practically to what I focus on is
the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then you talk about how to get
the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every farmer is looking for
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all looking to enhance if it's
food, nutritional quality of the food and
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cannabis, it's the quality of the
cannabis and the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can improve that, you have an
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question is how?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the job of manufacturers like
myself and many others to bridge the needs
[SPEAKER_01]: of farmers with a technology that's
readily adoptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of great
technologies out there that if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have that adoption, that easily adoptable
characteristic, it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in the market because it's just
a huge barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as an example, and this is probably
the biggest pushback we've had is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so you know, we have awesome
adoption with our technology in the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a huge testament to how well
microbes work across a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: management practices, cultivation
practices and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the best new product of the year in
late 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing success story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the hydroponic growers who use
sterile techniques where they pour bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: or they pour hydrogen peroxide into the
reservoirs regularly to kill all the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbe life and mostly to control
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a huge pain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how can I educate those growers who
know their point pouring in disinfectants,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that kill microbes into their grow
to use microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, educate on ecology and let them know
that plants have evolved those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and microbes do benefit plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're trying to do is mitigate
pathogens, but we're not trying to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from an ecological perspective,
you can start to educate on ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: niche theory, competition theory,
where if you can flood root zones with
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes, bacteria and fungi,
it actually, in some ways, these microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: act as a bio shield blocking pathogens and
blocking potential infection sites to
[SPEAKER_01]: limit pathogen infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one angle, along with the fact
that if you can maximize absorption of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, for plants using these natural
microbial solutions, which is synonymous
[SPEAKER_01]: with a living soil, bridging the gap,
starting to acknowledge that at least
[SPEAKER_01]: components of living soil can be applied
across all cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get people thinking and you can get
samples in their hands and they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every farmer wants to see results with
products they adopt with products are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a positive result,
you have just won over a customer and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to buy your technology
because they want those solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but they'll tell all of
their friends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no one keeps quiet when they've
just grown their best flowers ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone tells everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Shane, that goes even for
let's talk about we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but think about home tomato
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really avid, not to
change the subject, avid tomato growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, when I used to,
when I was younger and I used to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: these big tomatoes and they were delicious
and huge, I would go show all my neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of a look, you know, cause you're
kind of racing with all your neighbors to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the first tomatoes and get the best
tomatoes and get the biggest tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's no different with cannabis or any
other crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get excited about their
achievements and they want to share their
[SPEAKER_01]: achievements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this industry, we want to share our
success and we should share our success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have great results, you want to
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about social media,
but in general, you know, if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that works, it will get out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a model, we feel like everyone should
try a sample of our technology as just as
[SPEAKER_01]: an example, because we feel like you'll
have a good result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a good result,
that means we're bringing value to growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to be successful as a
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really great how you pointed
out that no matter where you traveled,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if people were looking for new and
better growing information, that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: was proud of growing cannabis and that
they were proud of the cannabis they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that as being a universal that,
that no matter where we are, no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can, what kind of inputs we can
afford, whether or not we have to do it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the basement because of prohibition or
whether or not we can grow outside because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's medical in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that everybody is engaging with
the cannabis plant and it's making them
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a wonderful universal for
our cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are way more similarities across the
world within our industry than
[SPEAKER_01]: differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I engage any cannabis conference or any
group of cannabis growers, I could have
[SPEAKER_01]: the same exchanges with groups that I meet
in Columbia and groups that I meet in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain or Australia or the US or the UK or
Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have the same passion for this
plant and for this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a similarity that the world
within this industry shares for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you an example that you just
kind of hit on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is last time I was in Australia,
we were in Perth, which is one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated cities in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very cool and cannabis is very
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going and engaging in the
hydroponic grow shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the last ones in one of the
very last days I was there for a 10 day
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch last October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met a guy who was super cool,
older guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd been growing there forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everyone keeps it on the DL,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be very discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like you're taking selfies
and Instagram pictures with these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take pictures in these stores
because they don't want their faces shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this gentleman, I started talking to
him, talking about the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I gave him some samples and he
was like, man, you've got to see what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he lived an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, can you please wait for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to give you a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're from the States and
you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it was just ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'll wait for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I waited there two hours, hung out,
you know, had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun hanging out at the hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love those stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came back and gave me handfuls of
four different strains of amazing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that he'd been, you know, nurturing and
growing and breeding for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a testament, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went two hours basically out of his way
to share, to gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be kind and I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I can imagine the idea of
going back to not being able to show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, faces on social media around
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my gosh, what a,
you know, what a, what a jump back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seven, eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I'm thinking of how
many people who are listening to the show
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, who are in States in the U S
that that's still the reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I am, I'm very, very fortunate
to live on the West coast and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and, and to have been able to
participate in all of this so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, thinking about these,
you know, you know, your story in Perth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could just as well be, be some of the
places here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so to everybody who's listening in a
prohibition state, hang in there folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll make our way to
you soon enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit on, on, on the evangelizing,
you know, how much challenge did you have
[SPEAKER_00]: with language, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the flower itself and the
smoking of it kind of transcends language.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get together people,
everybody knows how to, how a joint works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just like pass the joint around
a circle and everybody smiles and laughs
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, you know, some amount of
broken English can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what languages you speak,
but, but, you know, what was it like for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to talk to people in so many different
countries with so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: languages?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think talking and communicating are two
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's one of my goals for 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a goal for 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just traveled so much and it was in so
many different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously there was, it made it hard for
me to hunker down and, and be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: student to learn the language.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have great Spanish speaking partners
through Mexico and South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Spain, and they helped me a lot,
no doubt about it, but there's a body
[SPEAKER_01]: language and there's a, you know,
what does a hug mean to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to say anything to know
exactly what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass me a joint and give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens everywhere, you know,
and that, and a smile and the look of man,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a head shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we communicate, we do a lot
of communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I communicate with many people on
Instagram and direct messaging and emails
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lesser degree now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank goodness I'm trying to get away from
the emails completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these days, that's probably my 2019
goal also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the WhatsApp is another wonderful tool
that everyone around the world uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That in itself allows me, if I can't
understand every word, even the reading,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can translate it and engage and
understand the messages and translate it
[SPEAKER_01]: back and, and, and, and communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think communication is just the
effort you put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put everything I have into
communicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Colin Bell, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators though,
building their greenhouse before gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into how cannabis greenhouses
differ from ornamental crops can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build, and equip their greenhouses for
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: First starting in Northern California,
but expanding over the last five years to
[SPEAKER_00]: helping clients throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouses and
greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse,
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit greenhouseadvisorygroup.com to learn
more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well-known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum, and that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by True Terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can also stack them
with better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.

Terpenes to find out more, or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Colin Bell, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, Colin, we were
talking about how some people that you met
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to take selfies with you
because they are in prohibition countries
[SPEAKER_00]: still, and they can't have their face and
name attached to their cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious what other things that you
experienced around like prohibition vibes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of these countries that
you've gone to are still very much early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the transition towards even medical
before even getting to adult use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and taboo is in the air and potentially
danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have to share about what it
was like to be in prohibition countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, it's actually very
exciting in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a scientist that came from the
university, and now I'm navigating in this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, which is, I would say,
regulatory-wise dark grade of black
[SPEAKER_01]: markets throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that comes a level of risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, going from country to country,
engaging in this industry, you have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, what I think is really important,
I keep on using this word, engage,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to talk to our customers, to talk to
growers, to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn and grow, and that's what I
starve, star for is education.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, I have to find growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to find growers, sometimes in illegal
markets, you have to put yourself in
[SPEAKER_01]: positions where you are in areas where
illegal activity is occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have to be very discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be mindful of your environment
when you're navigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you know the people you're
working with and engaging with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than that, I've gotten some great
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an example, within this last year,
I was with some friends I met in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that are great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: No names, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they invited me to go to a special
session, which is, I didn't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a gathering is what I knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was given an address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very discreetly, and a time to meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get there, and I had to take a
train for hours from where I was staying
[SPEAKER_01]: in Newcastle, so it was, just for the
record, not in Newcastle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get to this place, I get off a
train and get at Uber, and it's in this
[SPEAKER_01]: old industry part of town, late on a
weekend night, completely isolated in an
[SPEAKER_01]: old industrial park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a couple of cars, and I kind of
wander over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's dark, and I am alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see this guy who looks big and
kind of dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make this assumption that this is
where the thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go up, and you're trying to be
modest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a little lenient, too,
because I'm a foreigner.
[SPEAKER_01]: From America, at least, from the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I text my friend, I'm like,
hey, I think I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this thing turns out to be this huge
event, this exchange, this swap meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's security.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through two levels of security.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go up to the third floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all in an abandoned warehouse
in this dark, again, a dark industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you get to the third floor,
and you open up a couple more doors,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 400 people in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's music.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a coffee bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a regular bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like a craft fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever been to a craft fair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a bunch of card tables set up
lining the walls halfway around this huge
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bunch of people with their
product, either their extracts or their
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are selling glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a craft fair or a
swap meet for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All 100% illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were buying and selling and smoking
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out to be a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you would never know about it
unless you're engaged in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt comfortable because I trusted
the people that invited me to this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a couple of other people that I
knew that I was working with in the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that, mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respected their opinion, but I went
ahead and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really glad I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until you opened that last door and you
suddenly see people with cocktails in
[SPEAKER_00]: their hands and smiling, up to that very
last point, it all sounded sketchy as
[SPEAKER_00]: hell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, it's a good thing to
point out that some of the countries that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were, like when you told me that you
were going to Colombia, I was thinking to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, dude, they snatch Americans there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did you ever feel, I mean,
except for maybe when you were walking up
[SPEAKER_00]: to that warehouse you just told us about,
were there times when you felt like you
[SPEAKER_00]: were in bodily danger trying to hunt out
these folks who were doing prohibition and
[SPEAKER_00]: era grows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in some areas or some
countries, it's pretty close by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always with people that are
typically always with people that are from
[SPEAKER_01]: those particular regions or cities like in
Medellin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a second set of eyes and a
good intuition of people that are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground that know, you know, if there's a
bad neighborhood or a good neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pretty fun example, not to name
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my one of our teammates a year ago
got in a cab and he was looking for some
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know anyone in Medellin at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this young man is from Mexico and he's
pretty and he's from Mexico city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's used to very rough areas and
this cabbie took him to this other area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my teammate, he was like,
man, Colin, it was like, like I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome to come because my complexion was
too light and DA and this young man,
[SPEAKER_01]: although he was from Mexico, he was
ordered to stay in the cab and only the
[SPEAKER_01]: cab driver could go in to exchange because
it was that dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's pretty, it can be sketchy,
but I've never ever felt like in danger at
[SPEAKER_01]: all, quite frankly, cause I'm around the
right people and there's bad areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous areas and safe areas in every
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens, but it's, it's, if you,
if you take care of, of where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going, it's really not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also says a lot about, you know,
if any of us were to go to these places
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and try to hunt up these beautiful
markets you're describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that, that having a trusted local is
the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do that no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: In every country, you're not going to go
to Australia or UK, even if you engage and
[SPEAKER_01]: speak the language and necessarily find
the people that you want to trade with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you should have people that know the
area and, and know people so you can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can get connected with,
with the good guys, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so this, this question may be a
non-starter, but it's kind of a shot in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and maybe I'm being too informed
by Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible too, but I was curious if
you came across like nutrient cartels,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in these different countries that
you're going to, they've been doing things
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way for a long time generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever nutrients are being input
into, you know, the hydroponics or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, somebody is selling that stuff
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then you come in and you're
talking to people about at the very least
[SPEAKER_00]: a new product, which probably actually
doesn't compete with a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already using because it's so
unique, but more so you're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: teach people living soil, which is a whole
different system, which will upset the
[SPEAKER_00]: apple cart on how some of these people
have been making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you experience any like, you're like
cannabis nutrient bad guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are, who, who did not appreciate your
presence?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I do agree that there's that
potential and honestly with the category
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in and we're in the additive
category, it's a little agnostic to the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient inputs, but there are some
clicks, I'll call them clicks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: very strongly opinionated on their
position in the marketplace and they
[SPEAKER_01]: control that and protect that as much as
they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I was moving in, to the UK with
another nutrient line or to Australia with
[SPEAKER_01]: another nutrient line, I don't think that
I would be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of history and a lot of
products are already there and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: groups have already taken up a lot of the
market share where we're coming in with
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a new category.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming in with life in a bottle
that's going to enhance everything you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in to maximize nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the synergies there alleviate a lot of
that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, right on, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next question, it's kind of a
different flavor than the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that I've asked you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had Colm Riley on the show,
we talked a lot about the bioregionalism
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes and how if you're going to
make nutrient compost teas, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: great to use local compost that hasn't
been shipped across the country so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are breeding more microbes that are
local to you and will do well in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and your weather and all this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use mammoth pea in my summertime
grow and that's got a particular microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: mix in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am curious, I guess it's a two-part
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, did you find that people had
any fidelity to the idea that they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: local microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of the question is,
are the microbes that are in your product
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for all these different
bioregions?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two really good questions and I
could kind of spend a lot of time on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will abbreviate and I'll say that,
you know, I think overall there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ubiquity where you'll find the same
microbial groups everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so microbes, bacteria and fungi can
adapt to different environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say that the environment
selects why they're so much diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: any one particular soil is because as
winter and summer seasons fluctuate and
[SPEAKER_01]: change over time, they're going to select
for microbial resilience of some microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: groups and other microbial groups are
going to really be stressed by that change
[SPEAKER_01]: in weather, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to maintain that function
and the resilience helps that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having microbes in from a local source
definitely helps bridge the confidence
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you're introducing them to the
same climatic or environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have confidence that they're
going to persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will say is microbes in nature and
microbes even in a cloth pot are not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the microscopic scale, it's very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we want to do is make sure we
nurture microbes that are very highly
[SPEAKER_01]: functional and very persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll say as the environment selects
is a great example and this is reflecting
[SPEAKER_01]: on my experiences in manufacturing or the
R&D for manufacturing our technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we started off with soils from
across the world because we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: nurture the biodiversity and the
functional diversity of as many microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we put them through a
functional trait selection platform and an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental trait selection platform to
maximize the functional aptitude of any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of final product, but also to weed
out microbes that couldn't persist in
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental stressful conditions that
were characteristic of farming practices
[SPEAKER_01]: or the management practices that growers
use in hydroponics and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started off with over 10,000
microbial species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we imposed them through our
selection platform, after many
[SPEAKER_01]: generations, we ended up with four
microbes, which suggests that most
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes are effective and appropriate for
farming practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to select the right microbes
for our cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we can get confidence
with biotech companies looking to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions or looking to develop solutions,
microbial solutions for cultivation can
[SPEAKER_01]: help growers use microbes with confidence
and precision in their precision
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colin, thank you so much for being a
guest on this very different kind of show,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every time I've talked with you
before, we jump right into soil science
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a happy place for both of us,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you started telling me about
these cultural experiences and these
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you were meeting, I knew I
wanted to hear more about these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured that the Shaping Fire
audience would appreciate it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different side of yourself with us so
that we could all be a little more aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of this global village of cannabis
enthusiasts we have, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I'm looking forward to seeing
you next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's keep growing, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to follow up with Colin or
find out more about the mammoth pea
[SPEAKER_00]: product, you can go to their website at
mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you enjoy Instagram, like the rest
of us do, you can go to the mammoth
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes Instagram, creatively enough,
at mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to follow Colin's travels
specifically or to reach out to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to do that is via his
Instagram, which is Colin W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's C-O-L-I-N-W-B-E-L-L.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you caught that earlier during the
interview, he prefers Instagram messages
[SPEAKER_00]: to email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not even going to bother giving
you an email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reach out to him via that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more episodes of information
on me and where I'll be speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out shangolose.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your company want to reach our
national audience of cannabis enthusiasts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you next time.
