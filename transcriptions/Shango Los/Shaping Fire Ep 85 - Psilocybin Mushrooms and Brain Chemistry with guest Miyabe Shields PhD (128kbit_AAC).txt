[SPEAKER_00]: The popularity of psilocybin mushrooms has
exploded in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are laws relaxing in many cities
across the country, but cultivation best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices are being codified and shared
online like never before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using mushrooms at different doses makes
for very different experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: A microdose is intended that you don't
feel it at all, while a half to a full
[SPEAKER_00]: gram makes for a fun day of exploration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can keep going up in
dosage from there to have a very powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: human experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere along this range of dosing,
though, can change the trajectory of your
[SPEAKER_00]: life because mushrooms have such a
profound impact on brain function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that odd?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms have been used by humans since
the beginning of recorded history,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet they have been taboo and barred
from research in the modern scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But happily, those changes and challenges
to research are coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't to say that we know nothing
about how mushrooms function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that most hallucinogenic
mushroom research has not been approved up
[SPEAKER_00]: until now, and scientists who were doing
the research during the dark days were
[SPEAKER_00]: shunned if they talked about it.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is neuropharmacologist,
Miyabi Shields, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Shields is co-founder of Real
Isolates, which, ironically, focuses on
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of secondary plant
components and synergistic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: blends, so essentially whole plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi received their PhD in
pharmaceutical sciences, focusing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry of the endocannabinoid system
from Northeastern University in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi has authored or co-authored six
peer-reviewed publications and presently
[SPEAKER_00]: has a patent under review for a novel
fungus and plant extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi also has a substantial list of
honors and awards, including a 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: International Cannabinoid Research Society
pre-doctoral research award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their TikTok channel, at Miyabi PhD,
has 180,000 followers and is where I first
[SPEAKER_00]: met Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not found this information
available anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we will describe the
interrelated body systems that are
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulated by psilocin and how these
systems interact at a chemical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second set is all about dosing
thresholds and the mechanics of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we focus on
specific applications for this knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to effectively use psilocybin
mushrooms to improve your health and life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really gotten to be fun to
have you back a few times and we clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little along in chat so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to the point where I'm not,
you know, I mean, I still get nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: before I record most of these shows
because I want to get it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so comfortable with you and we
have such an easy time chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just excited to get together
and chat with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not the kind of nervous anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stoked that we've gotten to that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we just have so much in common
and in what we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really, really also just excited
to touch on these topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm super passionate about
molecular pharmacology and I think these
[SPEAKER_02]: two things don't often get talked about
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to dive into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we should start this show off
with a little preempt because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you and I came up with the idea
for this show from us just chatting as now
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be going back and forth
between, you know, historical scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: papers, new scientific papers,
and I guess what I'd call like informed
[SPEAKER_00]: conjecture on your part, because you're
like, you're a pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you know, you're one of the
experts in the field in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the stuff that you're going to
say today is, you know, we haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to study yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important for people to
understand that, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified to make these educated guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to, you're going to kind
of let us know where the hard science ends
[SPEAKER_00]: and your conjecture begins, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we are going to be entering into a
space of abstract theory, which is that we
[SPEAKER_02]: know about these systems and we know like
certain facts about how the systems
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know like how that could
directly be extrapolated into the human
[SPEAKER_02]: brain because the human brain is so
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we have all of this
information from the general public and
[SPEAKER_02]: people who have reported and written and
shared all of these experiences,
[SPEAKER_02]: activating one or both of these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to be like kind of
piecing through the big gap between those
[SPEAKER_02]: two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, let's get right into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that when we consume a
psilocybin mushroom or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might call it a psilocybe mushroom if
we want to talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the species, but that's a mushroom that
has psilocybin, the chemical in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a psilocybe mushroom has psilocybin in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's in the human body,
it's not actually the psilocybin which
[SPEAKER_00]: creates the reaction in the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a psilocybe mushroom has psilocybin
in it, which our body converts to
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the psilocin that's the active
ingredient in the end for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you explain that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've never actually heard it
explained clearly how our body changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin into this psilocin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually really similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty similar to decarbing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is that our body is very
efficient at changing psilocybin into
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically the molecule psilocybin has
a phosphate group on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a phosphate group is this like very
negatively charged, like bulky piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: the molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that group does a couple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It prevents it from easily crossing into
the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also prevents it from binding to the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the effects are felt when a
molecule is able to bind and activate a
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that phosphate group changes the shape
of the molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this big, bulky, negatively charged
like piece on the edge of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so psilocybin is not active.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our body contains an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: An enzyme is like a little machine that
does a chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our body takes psilocybin and turns it
into psilocin by taking away that
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphate group and leaving behind just an
oxygen and a hydrogen or a hydroxyl group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes it active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So psilocybin is actually what would be
called a prodrug.
[SPEAKER_02]: In pharmaceutical sciences, there are
quite a few prodrugs actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe aspirin is an example of a
prodrug, which is something that goes into
[SPEAKER_02]: your body and then becomes activated by
the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like a different class of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not active on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: They become active when our body either,
in this case, takes off that phosphate
[SPEAKER_02]: group and then removes that big,
bulky, negative charge and allows it to
[SPEAKER_02]: activate the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once our body has removed that group
and it becomes this more, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: digestible, or that's probably a bad
choice of words, but a usable psilocin
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had not heard that pronunciation of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it go and bind with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the other times you've been here
when we've been doing the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics series, we're always talking
about the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk more about the
endocannabinoid system in second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is this psilocin molecule looking
for to connect with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, quickly, I don't know that that
pronunciation is right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of like tomato-tomato
and people prefer to pronounce things the
[SPEAKER_02]: way that, in my opinion, some of these
things are pronounced the way that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard other people pronounce them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back to your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they activate?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they activate the serotonin system and
serotonin system receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have ever seen the molecule,
it is really, really similar to serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serotonin is a tryptamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a class of molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is created from the amino acid
tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a very distinctive shape to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And psilocin is almost identical to
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you were saying before,
instead of calling it digestible,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I would say is that psilocin is a
puzzle piece that fits into the puzzle
[SPEAKER_02]: better after the phosphate group has been
removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's trying to fit into the same
spot on the receptors as serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the similarity in those shapes
that allows it to bind to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So psilocybin doesn't bind very well to
any of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we mentioned before, it doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But psilocin binds really well to many of
the serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it been called a pan agonist
before, pan meaning everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't bind equally to all of
those serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does favor some over the other,
specifically in terms of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been linked mostly to the serotonin
2A receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sub receptor type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there are 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quite a few different types of
serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have data for every single
subtype of receptor on psilocin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the only one that I saw that
it does not bind well to is the serotonin
[SPEAKER_02]: 3A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that receptor is actually a completely
different type of switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you imagine these receptors are on and
off switches in the body that start all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these domino effects, there are these
different types of switches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if I'm going with this metaphor,
there's a regular light switch that you
[SPEAKER_02]: see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a dimmer switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are those metallic on and off
switches.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's switches that are just buttons
that you press on and off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the serotonin 3 receptor is a
different subtype than all of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, in my opinion,
probably why it doesn't bind as well to
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of the activation otherwise,
it seems like psilocin activates almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the other serotonin system receptor
subtypes, which means that it mimics
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, too, if it's a pan
agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to use your light switch example,
it kind of makes me think of when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a big auditorium or something,
you'll see as you enter, often there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: a string of seven or eight light switches
for different parts of the hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine psilocin just showing up in
the human brain going, let's party,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just flicking them all on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the serotonin receptor the only variety
of receptor that psilocin is connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, when you take hallucinogenic
mushrooms, your brain just lights up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it as a first-person experience,
but we also know that when they put people
[SPEAKER_00]: in MRIs when they're using it or similar,
and people's brains are just lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other types of receptors that
accept psilocin as well, or is it mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: just in the serotonin group?
[SPEAKER_02]: So from what I've read, it's mostly just
in the serotonin group.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that it's all of the
serotonin subtypes is what makes it very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very unique to that activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think here's another thing that I'm
unsure about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the literature in the
scientific data and the previous
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific literature focuses on
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that every receptor subtype
has actually been tested, because often
[SPEAKER_02]: you only see what you're looking for,
and I'm not positive that it's been ruled
[SPEAKER_02]: out, that it wouldn't interact with other
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only one I know for certain
that has been ruled out that I saw was the
[SPEAKER_02]: dopamine D2 receptor, because that's one
key difference between serotonin and LSD,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that LSD does activate the D2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, not serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psilocybin and psilocin do not activate
the dopamine system, whereas LSD does
[SPEAKER_02]: activate that system partially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the only one that I know that I
can speak to for certain that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: ruled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a trick question,
because are there other things that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mushrooms that could be activated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Activating other systems, that is very,
very possible and also unexplored.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you study the serotonin system
so intimately, you've got a different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective than just about everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to hear your thoughts on
how rare and neat it is that this one
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule lights up so many serotonin
receptors at the same time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by you saying that, it suggests to
me that most other molecules would not
[SPEAKER_00]: light up so many of the different
serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about the rarity of that and
why mushrooms are unique because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think one of the most interesting
things is this contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my background in pharmaceutical
sciences, it's the contrast of synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals that target the serotonin
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them kind of are structured around
avoiding the serotonin 2 receptor family
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're trying to avoid the
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of how strongly it activates it,
it's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are other natural
products out there and other naturally
[SPEAKER_02]: occurring molecules that do work upon the
serotonin system, but they don't do it
[SPEAKER_02]: with such veracity or potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very potent interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is because it's
very, very similar to serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that's interesting about
psilocybin that I've always wondered is
[SPEAKER_02]: its purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I've always just wondered about
its original purpose in the mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: because it clearly must be doing something
for them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that's far outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of natural products,
these molecules in these plants and in
[SPEAKER_02]: these funguses, they are serving a purpose
for those living plants and living
[SPEAKER_02]: funguses as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this big homology or
similarity between all of those molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plants and in funguses and in
bacteria and in other living things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then in all of the molecules inside
us, inside our brains and bodies and
[SPEAKER_02]: circulating around in our blood,
causing signaling systems and immune
[SPEAKER_02]: system responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's amazing that living
things produce molecules that are so
[SPEAKER_02]: comparable and so active on the human
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always been really magical to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a magical thing with cannabis
and the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's magical with the
serotonergyx as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's an evolutionary link
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would have to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you calling it magical is
one of the least scientific things I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard you say, but it's also like
really true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are reasons why humans have
put mushrooms on a spiritual, magical,
[SPEAKER_00]: otherworldly pedestal because the effect
that it has on the human brain are
[SPEAKER_00]: literally mind blowing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's beyond our present scientific
knowledge, though we're getting able to
[SPEAKER_00]: research more of it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But historically, if you don't know how
something functions, it's magic,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not really an inaccurate
term.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and it's also not inaccurate that
there's is still so much unknown left in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world, even with the amount of science
that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, science is my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things that I learned from
it is just this giant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: giant unknown that is still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of like spirituality and that
level of unknown and that level of faith,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not at a place yet where we actually
can say we have a big understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the research on psychedelics,
they use this word sometimes, ineffable,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means like you can't describe it in
words, I believe is the definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that I think is
really fascinating about specifically the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin system, also the endocannabinoid
system and how they work together,
[SPEAKER_02]: but specifically linked to serotonergic
psychedelic experiences is that it can
[SPEAKER_02]: create feelings and experiences that are
ineffable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're mystic and magic and spiritual and
deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have yet to be able, because we
can't describe them because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: ineffable, it's very, very difficult to
study them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that that comes from these
molecules that are also from a living
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, part of this planet is just,
it is magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I love describing science that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it seems like a hypocritical,
like, maybe not hypocritical, but it seems
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like, it would be in contrast to
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always said that in terms of
merging my scientific passion with my
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual beliefs, I've always said that
both science and spirituality are ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: embracing and understanding this like
giant unknown in the universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just so much unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the things that
exploring, and I'm so excited to see as we
[SPEAKER_02]: can, like, open up research and explore
these, you know, this interaction with the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin system more, I'm excited to see
what we find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't be surprised if we don't
just find even more unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna go one more, I'm gonna go
one more step into this unknown magical
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual before we get back to the hard
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, you know, this idea of an
ineffable experience comes up all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: when talking about DMT,
dimethyltryptamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiences that humans have on
significant doses of that drug are so
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond human regular experience that it's
really cool that that whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptors have evolved when talking
about DMT and the experience and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and rewires the human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It demands the development of first new
vocabulary to decide to describe it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that humans can share their experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it gets in the hands of like
scientific researchers like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that kind of potentially sloppy new
magical vocabulary that people use to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it then demands new specific
scientific vocabulary and understanding to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it at a scientific level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this kind of growth of
the ineffable drug experience becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: more malleable by humans where we can like
talk about them and understand them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we are right at the front of
this huge explosion of this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning by humans everywhere,
because we're all getting easier access to
[SPEAKER_00]: these plant medicines and scientists are
more encouraged to research them now for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just so much more available and
there's so much more communication in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community that helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's incredible that so
many people can have such similar
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also DMT is very, very similar molecule to
psilocin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are almost identical because DMT is
almost identical to serotonin and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I was describing earlier with
psilocybin turning into psilocin,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you remove a phosphate group and you
leave a hydroxyl group, just the OH,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you were to remove the hydroxyl group,
that would be DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're incredibly similar molecules,
but then they have these different
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the community and what I was
mentioning earlier about how we have all
[SPEAKER_02]: of this information from the community and
from people who are actively using these
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules and then reporting on their
experiences and they're comparable,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're similar experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ineffable experience or that
mysticism experience, it's also given a
[SPEAKER_02]: third name in scientific literature called
oceanic boundlessness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that entire experience is linked to
actually better outcomes, like better
[SPEAKER_02]: health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, to me, super interesting because
essentially I equate that in some way,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is like my understanding of it is
that that's equated to me with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual wellness or something that is
ineffable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that we're quantifying
right now, but we can say that if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: that mystical ineffable experience,
or if you have something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is a significant chance that it
increases your health outcome,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a physical quantitative response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is just a piece down this road
of let's call it mind-body connection that
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is under-researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say even in all the things that
I've read, and this is one of my things
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm super passionate about,
we're just scratching the surface on
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding the connection between our
mind, our bodies, and then how we view
[SPEAKER_02]: that connection to the world and the rest
of the life that's on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, I love how you put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's bring us back in for
back to the harder science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good- All right, away from the
tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so let's bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the endocannabinoid mechanics
series that we've been doing together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned kind of as a passing thought
that mushrooms interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system too, which was
originally what gave me the idea for this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already explained to us very
clearly how the Cilicin molecule lights up
[SPEAKER_00]: so many of the serotonin receptors after
that particular group is stripped off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious how the Cilicin molecule
interacts with the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two different ways,
and it's like an indirect way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is that the serotonin 2A
receptor, which is the one that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: linked to the psychedelic experiences,
that receptor, when you activate it,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually leads to an increase in
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the downstream effects of
activating this receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the first way, you're increasing
your level of endocannabinoids after you
[SPEAKER_02]: take psilocybin because it activates these
receptors and that's part of what those
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next way is a little bit more
complicated and it has to do with the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that we more recently have learned that
these receptors are not operating by
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say like the serotonin 5HT2A
receptor, you know, previously to let's
[SPEAKER_02]: say like 10 years ago, we were all
assuming that that receptor kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: operated by itself or it operated with
another version of the same receptor like
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin and serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only more recently that we've
discovered that these receptors can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually bind to another receptor in a
different system and that that will change
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that it signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not much is known in terms of how it
changes the signaling and what the
[SPEAKER_02]: downstream effects of this are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is known is that the serotonin
5HT2A receptor does bind to the CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, which is the main
endocannabinoid system receptor and the
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor that's responsible for the
therapeutic effects or most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that piece of it is less
understood, but is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some population in the brain of
serotonin 2A receptors that when they are
[SPEAKER_02]: being activated by psilocin, will probably
be attached to a CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least in part, like they exist together
in the brain cells and will come together
[SPEAKER_02]: and operate together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when those two receptors are operating
together, their signaling can be altered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really have a great tangible
grasp on how and what that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do know that it affects the
endocannabinoid system because the CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor is the main receptor for the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take one step back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I probably should have started the
set with this, but would you give just an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy thumbnail explanation of what the
serotonin system is in the human body for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who may not be familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the serotonin system is one of the
best known neurotransmitter signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: systems in the brain and in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk a lot about serotonin making you
happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's usually one of the main
associations that people have with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But serotonin is a molecule and the
serotonin system, just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, is made up of the
receptors and the enzymes that work upon
[SPEAKER_02]: the serotonin molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And serotonin controls a lot of very,
very important functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where my interest originally
came to the table, is that the serotonin
[SPEAKER_02]: system and the endocannabinoid system
actually have a huge overlap in the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that they control and how they work
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're localized in some of the
similar areas in how they modify this
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most important ones being the
brain and the gut or the GI tract
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So serotonin, just like the
endocannabinoids, is a signaling molecule
[SPEAKER_02]: and the system itself is all over your
body and controls a huge number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why there's so many different
receptors and that's why they are
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in different parts of the brain
and the body that help to regulate these
[SPEAKER_02]: different processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sets up my next question great
because I was going to follow up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the serotonin system and the
endocannabinoid system standing next to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other at equal levels of complexity
and control or does the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system control slash balance the serotonin
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we talk about the
endocannabinoid system, we're always
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how it's the body's natural
thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a system that's running
hot, it'll cool it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's running, if it's sluggish,
it'll pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the serotonin cycle, is the serotonin
system one of the systems the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system modulates or are
they like two different cooks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there's a lot of overlap,
so I'm not really sure how you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a complicated answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually say that it's a relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best metaphor I have for it is
probably marriage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like a marriage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both have things that they take care
of on their own and together, but neither
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them almost ever operates without
some form of feedback from the other
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: For an example of this, as I mentioned
earlier, if you activate the serotonin 2A
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor, you end up with elevated levels
of endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an example of the serotonin system
modifying the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the flip side, the endocannabinoid
system is capable of modifying levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin, is capable of modifying the
density of the serotonin receptors,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it goes the other direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fulfill very different roles while
they are also modifying the same overall
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work together sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work against each other other times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly complicated dance,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the complexity between
these two systems and how they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on by psilocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're usually talking about the
endocannabinoid system and whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine because both you and I are very
much whole plant cannabis advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that mushrooms have their own
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there reasons to make sure that we
take a whole mushroom or an infused tea
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of isolated psilocybin crystals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crystallized psilocybin is becoming much
more available as people have made best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for that extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of people tend to want
to avoid eating the flesh of the mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: because it upsets a lot of people's
stomachs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people believe that you should eat
the whole mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say since it's all water
soluble, you do it in an infused tea and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can leave the flesh of the
mushroom in the strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some people just go for the crystal
because they see it to be more of a pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: easier on the stomach experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's been a whole lot of
actual research on this yet except for
[SPEAKER_00]: individual psychonauts doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the brain chemistry part of it,
is there a justification for whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there is, but there's not a
lot of research on the different molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: that are in the different strains of these
mushrooms or even just in the main
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the active compounds,
psilocybin is the active compound in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been identified, but there's going to
be a lot of other things present in the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual living mushroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the difference between the
psilocybin, there's pretty much a perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: analogy here between that and whole full
spectrum cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say a rosin press or something that is
extracted partially purified versus then
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate or distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to cannabis, I think that there
are advantages and disadvantages to each
[SPEAKER_02]: version.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certainly advantages to isolated
forms of things because for one,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's reproducible as opposed to whenever
you have a living thing producing a large
[SPEAKER_02]: number of products, there is the chance
that it's probable that you would get
[SPEAKER_02]: different effects, but I would argue that
that's also a positive once you can
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it, which we are, I think,
scratching the surface of doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that there are just so many
things in all mushrooms, not just
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocybin mushrooms that are worth
investigating that haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are tons of different types besides
even its own terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I recently read a paper where
they found molecules in mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_02]: activate the endocannabinoid system,
which makes them cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not psilocybin mushrooms,
they're different mushrooms, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because it could exist in the
psilocybin mushrooms as well because we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't actually have a ton of information
on what that looks like and on isolating
[SPEAKER_02]: those compounds and then testing them
against the receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The order of operations would go first
taking everything out of the mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_02]: then separating them out into types of
molecules and then how many of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: present, and then testing those
individually against each of the receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually seen a ton of
information on the smaller, what would be
[SPEAKER_02]: the rare molecules that are in the
mushrooms, but there's certainly many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many that are there and probably many that
have yet to be investigated or even
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great time to be a college or
post-graduate student who is both a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychonaut and a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back in school, there were the
odd folks who you knew were doing drug
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in the lab when I was in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very shush-shush and very
frowned upon and the school could not find
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's full on programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great time to be a scientist
psychonaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff is open to folks and we
don't know it yet, and yet now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to research it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you just can't deny, you can't
deny that there is therapeutic benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's therapeutic benefit and
there's also, it's the same thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: The revolution with cannabis I really
think helped pave the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: for this to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like something that was so
stigmatized and that still is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think that we still have work to do,
but you know, it has really changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The culture around cannabis has really
changed and it's been a lot of work by a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people who've come well before me
and you're one of them and has done a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of work in changing this stigma for the
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's paved the way
because we are all able to see now or a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger population is able to see like wow,
there's a lot of therapeutic benefit that
[SPEAKER_02]: has yet to be explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's more open, I think,
to that and I think it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really exciting because you can't deny
that there's therapeutic benefit here and
[SPEAKER_02]: that understanding it will only help us to
like reduce the risk of the negative
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap this up and go to
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set when we come back,
we are going to talk about the thresholds
[SPEAKER_00]: for different dosages for mushrooms and
how that impacts the mechanics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brains at different thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_00]: other psychedelics and it's a very strange
time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014 and as the
[SPEAKER_00]: market has diversified into psilocybin and
other plant medicines, Green Light has
[SPEAKER_00]: been right there, evolving with their
diverse clients to provide legal expertise
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high level of legal acumen,
creative strategy and precision that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the labor and labor market with
[SPEAKER_00]: layered local and national drug laws on
your own, you are at risk of fumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner or simply because you want to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their work
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Green Light Law Group today and
learn more about the services they can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer your industry leading cannabis or
psychedelics company.

been family owned and providing reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_00]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.

particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_00]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, blood orange, melon and lemons
across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all gas, glue and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare and Headband and their award
winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: delights just about every person on
everybody's palate, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show Cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: II, which has a great THC high but looks
so much like a fern that some folks can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for well balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_00]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: of Willie Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are looking for regular,
feminized or auto flowers, Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company has the gear to make this your

Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials and of course, gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Lose Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own garden, insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and always gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Lose and join our
[SPEAKER_00]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose and my guest
today is pharmacologist, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this second set, we're gonna be
talking a lot more about specific dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: and thresholds for dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're gonna start off by defining
some of these terms we're gonna be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just simply Google mushroom dosage
chart, you'll find a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: representations of this chart and there's
a little bit of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, the doses we're gonna be
talking about today fall into five
[SPEAKER_00]: different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is the micro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it's true that how much is the
right micro dose for you is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to work out for yourself,
generally speaking, people discuss it as
[SPEAKER_00]: being 0.1 gram of the mushroom itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prefer 0.08, some other people may
have their own number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, when we're talking about a
micro dose, we're talking about 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a term I actually learned
from Miyabi when we were prepping for
[SPEAKER_00]: this, which is a museum dose, which is a
little bit more than a micro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually looking to have a little
bit more going on in your head,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is gonna be about more like 0.5 of a
gram, so about a half gram there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is the mini dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mini dose is more like one to two
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're definitely going to get some
psychoactive activity, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably still be around people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's the macro dose,
which is gonna be anywhere between three
[SPEAKER_00]: to four grams generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, you're gonna be having
a significant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably gonna be more likely to
avoid people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be seeing sacred geometry and
nature and you're putting together a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, people can tell that you're
tripping by this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then above the macro, above three to
four grams, above four grams, people go
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six, seven grams, sometimes more,
which is epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are generally called these
heroic doses or God-seeing doses,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get yourself more familiar with
this scale by simply Googling mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the vocabulary that we're gonna
be using today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, so Miyabi, why do we often
experience permanent or at least long-ish
[SPEAKER_00]: term temporary changes to ourselves after
taking mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have the experience after we
take it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it feels like things change for us for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like this afterglow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, it feels like certain
attributes wear off, but certain learning
[SPEAKER_00]: stays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of wondering if there's like a
half-life for a mushroom experience as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as like the neurology goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in terms of the after effects
or the afterglow effects, I think in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion, those are directly linked to
molecules or effects that the slowest
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules had that are still in your
system actively in terms of the more
[SPEAKER_02]: longer term changes and effects that
people can feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a different piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what both of them kind of point to in
what's unique about the serotonergics and
[SPEAKER_02]: activating the serotonin system seems to
be this disruption in what would be like
[SPEAKER_02]: the default pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of us have like, we all have a ton
of subconscious default brain activity
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that our brain just does automatically
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can try to consciously think of
things from different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I think most of us have had a
situation in our lives where we've thought
[SPEAKER_02]: through something a million different ways
and we can't seem to find a way through,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can't approach the problem from any
more ways than we're aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a piece of that comes from our brain
being stuck in some of these like similar
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the reasons why I think that
there are these lasting effects has to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with just the disruption of that pattern,
the disruption of the same patterns
[SPEAKER_02]: happening over and over and over again,
and the creation of new patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I think that in terms of
like an after effect and some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: staying or some of them leaving,
it could have to do with these pathways
[SPEAKER_02]: still being freshly activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a saying that neurons or so
neurons are brain cells, but brain cells
[SPEAKER_02]: that fire together will wire together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when a brain cell is activated and
activates another brain cell, and it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: this like new circuitry or this new path,
there are actual physical and chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: reactions between those two brain cells
that facilitate them firing again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it isn't until they are kind of weeded
out that they stop firing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that when you are activating
your serotonin system with mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as we mentioned in the first set,
it's a pan-agonism or it's an activation
[SPEAKER_02]: of all different types of serotonin
receptors all over the brain, you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a lot of new pathways or a lot of
new signaling systems and you disrupt this
[SPEAKER_02]: default.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it described as I think it's
called the default network or a default
[SPEAKER_02]: mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it described that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of disrupting that, you're kind
of taking your brain out of that routine
[SPEAKER_02]: and like showing your brain or like
facilitating your brain going down these
[SPEAKER_02]: other pathways that are new avenues to
approach things and new perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one piece of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other piece I think is
something that we touched on a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, which is mysticism or oceanic
boundlessness and or at the higher doses
[SPEAKER_02]: and thresholds, we were talking about
changes in your perception of yourself or
[SPEAKER_02]: your ego, usually called ego death or ego
disillusion, and changing the way that you
[SPEAKER_02]: perceive yourself and your identity and
your place in the world and how that can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a huge lasting effect on your
perspective and how you approach the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if that was too broad of
an answer for your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also going to follow up with
something very specific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that as being true, would you
describe what is happening at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific biological chemical level when we
all talk about these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms help create new neural paths and
mushrooms help deepen your neural paths?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean mechanically in the
brain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the storytelling way of saying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the specific chemical way of saying
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chemical way of saying it is that
if you imagine like your brain is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: network, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your brain is a network of
transportation and things are going to and
[SPEAKER_02]: from, you know, the stronger and more
often, so the more often like two brain
[SPEAKER_02]: cells will fire together, the stronger
that connection will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of the biology and the
chemistry of that, it actually strengthens
[SPEAKER_02]: it in terms of like it will physically
create proteins that will link themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: together that are like little Velcro
proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will become a bigger and stronger like
surface area or synapse like area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are multiple ways that your body can
make it so that that connection happens
[SPEAKER_02]: easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's faster and easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the equivalent I would say of
like having a dirt road versus like a
[SPEAKER_02]: freeway or a throughway where there's just
like tons of lanes and tons of cars are
[SPEAKER_02]: moving and there's no lights or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more often that you use something
or some pathway, the more likely your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain is to turn that pathway into a
freeway or a throughway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when you're in a pattern or a
habit or just actually as we go about our
[SPEAKER_02]: lives, our brain is constantly trying to
find the most efficient way to activate
[SPEAKER_02]: those same pathways that it does all of
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're saying that when you
take a mushroom and it changes this neural
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway, it promotes neural growth and it
like deepens these pathways, what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying is that the molecule activates
these serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when it activates those serotonin
receptors, it causes a new pathway,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new domino effect to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when this domino effect happens
and you have this new pathway being opened
[SPEAKER_02]: up, it deepens this connection that
otherwise wouldn't be there between these
[SPEAKER_02]: two brain cells because it's almost like a
false connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simulating or it's mimicking what
would happen if serotonin had been
[SPEAKER_02]: released between those two cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you say this pathway is being
deepened, chemistry-wise, you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that more of these Velcro-like meshing
proteins are being formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like having a thin copper cord
connecting things versus a big fat copper
[SPEAKER_00]: cord or some other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your bandwidth is increasing
along that path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your brain cells are all attached to,
usually they are, many of them have
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple connections and they're
constantly in flux, like changing these
[SPEAKER_02]: connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although as we get older, we do it less
and less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in general, it's often referred to as
plasticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, our brains become less plastic
as we get older.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we start to only strengthen these
connections that are currently being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not always like the proteins that
are like the Velcro molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could also be like the levels of
receptors that are present, the levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymes that are present or transporter
proteins that are present.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the body is very, very complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this amazing way, there's a lot of
different ways to do the same thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: they all support each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I say that like when you're
disrupting that pattern, you're activating
[SPEAKER_02]: new pathways and you're kind of simulating
maybe a new interaction that wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise happened because there wouldn't
be serotonin there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually there's like a whole series of
processes that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like one thing happens to make
the neural net more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually making these Velcro
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is setting out in new directions to
make the neural network more complex and
[SPEAKER_00]: have more redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be even changing the gene
expression of certain receptors or certain
[SPEAKER_02]: factors in the cell because these,
I mean, I'm not going to go into way too
[SPEAKER_02]: much detail on this part, but these
receptors, like there's different classes
[SPEAKER_02]: of them and we know so much about what
they do with the signaling pathway when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can take this one thing called a G
protein and it's splits up into three
[SPEAKER_02]: other things and each of those three
pieces that get split apart will go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: different part and do a different
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's incredibly complex and it's
beautiful in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many ways in which they end
up being closer tied to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's similar to, yeah, I guess it's a
rounded approach that it happens in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not actually unique to any of the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens in general when you activate
systems in tandem and when your brain is
[SPEAKER_02]: forming these connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward and let's talk about
the differences in the different results
[SPEAKER_00]: in the neural network based on these
different threshold doses that we set up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that when we apply these
different doses, we are trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we are getting different results,
that's telling me that the brain is firing
[SPEAKER_00]: differently on these different amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by talking about
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just use 0.1 since that is generally
taken as the baseline microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more or less, the main protocols that
people follow are either like five days
[SPEAKER_00]: on, two days off, or three days on,
one day off, which are wildly similar
[SPEAKER_00]: between the stamets and the Fadiman
protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way or another, you're taking this
small amount of 0.1 for several days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row and then you're taking a little break
and then you're doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we know about what is happening
for this repetitive microdose versus what
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about in a minute, which is
like when we take a mini or a macrodose,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on mechanically in our brain
that makes the microdose efficient or
[SPEAKER_00]: effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's a couple different pieces
of this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first piece is actually what happens
at a different dose to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just pick the 5-HT2A receptor
since that's the one that's classically
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with the effects of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That receptor, when we're talking about
how a molecule will attach to a receptor,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's activating it, there's
inactivating it, and then there's
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all of these ways in which you can
do it, but in just the most general way we
[SPEAKER_02]: can say it, Solosin activates the 5-HT2A
receptor, but it does that for a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of time and there's a statistical
probability of it binding to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say Solosin is in the body like
you're taking a microdose of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not a large concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the statistical probability that it
will bind to the receptor is less,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is part of how it makes it less
active because there's less of them that
[SPEAKER_02]: will be bound to the receptors causing
these effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one difference is the number of
molecules bound to these receptors as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of the actual way, like smaller
amount that's present in the body,
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is true for all receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: All receptors and the interaction with the
molecules that activate them, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: that's drugs or molecules inside our
bodies, that interaction is in
[SPEAKER_02]: equilibrium, which just means that it's a
balance between what is there and what is
[SPEAKER_02]: not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more of any of the drug or any
of the molecule that you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more you're going to push that
equilibrium to having the molecule bound
[SPEAKER_02]: to the receptor and there will be more and
more of them bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the microdose, you have like a
very low amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you probably don't have all of your
serotonin receptors bound to Solosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's highly likely that it's only a
partial number of them at any given time
[SPEAKER_02]: because the dosage is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that leads to differences in the
downstream signaling because when the
[SPEAKER_02]: receptor is activated, as I mentioned
earlier, it starts this really long
[SPEAKER_02]: signaling cascade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time it ends up with a
number of changes, but those changes are
[SPEAKER_02]: additive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's one receptor that it's
happening and then another receptor that
[SPEAKER_02]: will be different than if there's only
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a does the variable that you're
doing it so often add something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like certainly macro doses,
which we'll talk about, have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: special benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious about the fact that taking
the small amount five days in a row,
[SPEAKER_00]: does hitting that same note again and
again and again, is there some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like training that is taking place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when it's that often, you're seeing
reactions in other systems or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be something to doing it so
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up
because I totally forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my second piece that I was going
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second piece of it that is different
is that you're doing it regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the first end, you're only doing a
very low level activation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably not all of the serotonin
receptors, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second difference being that
you are doing it regularly, even
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of the protocol, it's regular
and it's pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, in the microdosing case,
if we're going to compare it to what your
[SPEAKER_02]: body feels like is happening, your body
feels a little bit like you just have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more serotonin in your body all the
time because you're doing it regularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So your body then does have what is called
a homeostatic change or it's a reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our bodies are constantly balancing
what is happening today and what happened
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday with what is going to happen
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the main things that our
body is responsible for doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in terms of there being like low
levels of your body thinking that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: low levels of serotonin or slightly higher
levels of serotonin than are normally
[SPEAKER_02]: there, there are definitely changes that
it will induce that are different from
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're discussing later in the
macrodose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different from then a very large
scale interaction with all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin receptors just once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually the same mechanism or a
similar mechanism to most of the long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: mental health medications also function
based on this sort of long-term low dose
[SPEAKER_02]: effect or homeostatic effect that your
body changes over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very common for mental health
prescription drugs for you to be monitored
[SPEAKER_02]: over time because they don't take effect
for a couple of weeks and then it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: titration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a similar thing or it's a similar
scale of an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the microdoses, we are getting
some binding but not complete binding to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we're doing it
regularly, I don't know, I guess I could
[SPEAKER_00]: say creates new opportunities for the
neural network to use its resources
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a fair way to put it in
layman's terms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that doing it regularly induces
small changes in the brain as if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly higher levels of serotonin all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that cause me to produce less
serotonin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you stopped microdosing suddenly,
would it leave me in a serotonin depleted
[SPEAKER_00]: state because the mushrooms have been
using those receptors?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any information that
supports that but is it possible that it
[SPEAKER_02]: increases the levels of like enzymes that
metabolize serotonin?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've seen anything that
supports that it would leave you like with
[SPEAKER_02]: a depletion, although there are some
molecules out there that do and that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like documented that they do or they can
have that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of them I'm thinking is MDMA and
it does induce like a change and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: at like larger doses, but it does induce a
change that leads to like a temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling of like depletion afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's jump up the scale to
macrodoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're talking between like three
and four grams roughly of the mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we're not really talking
about doing this regularly like a
[SPEAKER_00]: microdose we're going to take five days a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more something that folks do
semi-regularly or a couple times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or once a year or this is more an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ceremony for a lot of people
unless they're just partying on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most folks, this is, you know,
they are doing this to create meaning in
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not talking about doing it
regularly, but we are talking about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a hell of a lot more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see from your perspective
the differences between the macro and the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro experience that you just laid out
for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's clearly a big difference
between activating all of the receptors at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that I should mention
now about the microdosing is that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at these lower levels, not all the
receptors will be activated equally
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned, like some of them will
be active and some of them will be
[SPEAKER_02]: inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the lower doses, it's way more likely
that the cellucid molecules are only
[SPEAKER_02]: activating certain receptor subtypes that
it's especially attracted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you get into the higher and
higher doses, it will start attaching to
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the serotonin receptors because
there's so much there, right, that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to activate all of the different
types and all of them at once and all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, you know, we've seen them in the
brain scans, you end up with these like
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful brains that are just like
completely lit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, in terms of like the big
long-term benefit in the bigger doses,
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely think that it is linked to
the mysticism or oceanic boundlessness and
[SPEAKER_02]: or ineffable way of describing that
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that people do it to try to
like fix something or to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the setting being really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's interesting because
I think about it as like if a problem or
[SPEAKER_02]: if a problem is like a mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends put this really
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have a problem and it's a
mountain that you're trying to climb and
[SPEAKER_02]: you just end up trying to approach it from
different trailheads, eventually like you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably will find a way to climb the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is sometimes to a point in
our lives where we've approached that same
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain so many times that we can't
possibly see a different way to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, climb up that mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just, you know, we don't have
that option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the main positive
attributes of a big macro dose,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is just one time or way less
frequent is that you have this activation
[SPEAKER_02]: where you activate all of the receptor
subtypes at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have a way larger disruption in
that default pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a way larger activation of
the extraneous others or new types of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways, new perspectives and new
thoughts that you could then reintegrate
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, take from that experience
in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any idea what uniquely is
happening when you activate all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a micro dose is you know, we're pushing
the button on some of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing this kind of slow and
steady wins the race kind of improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: for the neural network versus taking a
macro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are essentially taking all of the
buttons on all of the receptors and just
[SPEAKER_00]: mashing the hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going from, you know,
one person singing every day to suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole coral all singing together and
the melody, it creates something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: way more than the sum of its parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know what that is in the brain when
we're taking macro doses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some state in the brain that we
achieve from mashing all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know how it feels, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm curious to know, do we know what's
happening like chemically in the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: that at the same time we're having these
spiritual experiences?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like chemically in the brain,
it's probably chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're activating every
serotonergic cell, not just in the brain
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at the macro doses, like there's
body effects, there's like stomach effects
[SPEAKER_02]: and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But talking about the brain, you're
activating and you're super activating all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the serotonin like neurons that then go
on, they go on to activate other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned earlier, that they
activate and can modify the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But serotonin also plays an important role
in the dopamine system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's originally, this is like an older
belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be believed that serotonin and
dopamine were like contrary to one another
[SPEAKER_02]: or that they were like opposites and they
balanced each other out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been the more and more that we've
looked into all of these systems for that
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, not just serotonin, dopamine and
the endocannabinoid system, but
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically those three, they're very,
very closely linked together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have this massive activation of
the serotonin system, but you're also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have this massive downstream
activation of the dopamine system and the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of scientifically,
at my level, what is happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from my understanding of what
would happen to the receptors at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point, is that all of them are doing all
of their downstream signaling pathways at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a massive overlap between some of
the pathways being synergistic,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that they increase each other
and some of the pathways being
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonistic or they cancel each other
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, the serotonin 2A and 2C
receptors often are viewed as canceling
[SPEAKER_02]: each other out when it comes to how they
affect dopamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of this is kind of like competing
and happening at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I think we know, at least one of
the things that we're learning,
[SPEAKER_02]: increasingly learning is that coming out
of this, like for the health benefits and
[SPEAKER_02]: where those come from, it appears to be
linked to this feeling of a deep
[SPEAKER_02]: connectedness experience that is
incredible to me that it's linked to a
[SPEAKER_02]: system in the brain or an interaction in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that certainly seems to be more
profound at the higher doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, one more question on this track
before we move on to the next topic area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is you mentioned that at the macro
doses, not only are the serotonin
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors all being mashed on,
but also there's all these other effects
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other parts of the body,
including the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we know that the bowels are
lit up and your breathing is impacted in
[SPEAKER_00]: some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly your muscle sets react to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the
non-neural receptors that get lit by a
[SPEAKER_00]: macro dose and kind of explain to us
what's happening in the totality of our
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like mushrooms are a very whole
body drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the easiest thing I think to describe
is the stomach one, because that's like
[SPEAKER_02]: very, it's part of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the most serotonin receptors in
your gut and GI area and in your stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your stomach produces huge amounts of
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so activating those serotonin
receptors, that's part of what causes that
[SPEAKER_02]: stomach upset.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also other things in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I think add to that effect,
but a piece of that upset stomach feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from activating the receptors that
are in your gut and in your stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise there's this communication back
and forth always between your brain and
[SPEAKER_02]: your body and between what is called the
peripheral or your body's nervous system
[SPEAKER_02]: and then your central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things, it's the feeling of
how you can have decreased pain or
[SPEAKER_02]: decreased temperature regulation,
even just decreased sensory feedback in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: A piece of that comes from another
disruption or a communication disruption
[SPEAKER_02]: between peripheral and central.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you are flooding your body with a
molecule that activates receptors that are
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and that are so expressed in
your central nervous system and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: core of controlling these things,
that's a piece of what causes the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: effect or the whole experience is that
there's always a feedback between what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on in the brain and what's going on
in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these little loops that our body goes
through, they're regulated along the way
[SPEAKER_02]: in many different pieces by these
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by taking something that mimics
serotonin, you're modifying every piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: that loop for those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there serotonin receptors throughout
the body similar to endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors throughout the body?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that they have the same
exact profile of the amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both the endocannabinoid system and the
serotonin system are expressed very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very highly in the brain and both of them
are expressed also in the GI tract.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the endocannabinoid system,
I believe, is more in the fat tissue than
[SPEAKER_02]: the serotonin system is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the serotonin system is also
found more heavily in like the cardiac or
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of the endocannabinoid system and the
serotonin system are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of like how highly they're
expressed, I think they have a slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: different expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that if you asked me,
I would have said, oh, yeah, of course
[SPEAKER_00]: there's serotonin receptors in the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, of course but I think I also
forgot that until you mentioned it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm now thinking more holistically
instead of, oh, serotonin receptors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain and I'm thinking about, oh,
serotonin receptors in like these
[SPEAKER_00]: groupings all around the body,
suddenly it makes a lot more sense why
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms activate so many different
places in the body because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not that the mushroom has to have a
bunch of different chemicals to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: these different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the receptors are all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to follow up on, as you were
explaining that, you mentioned that you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that there are other chemicals in
the mushroom that activate in the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything more to say about
that, about what these other chemicals may
[SPEAKER_00]: be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know that there's probably tons,
depending on the strain of mushroom that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at, but one of the class of
molecules that I'm really interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: has to do with like sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms can produce, and mushrooms
produce these really complicated,
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce these really complicated types
of molecules that are like similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar or like linked to sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and then I'm also interested in
very, very similar compounds to psilocybin
[SPEAKER_02]: or psilocin, that there are probably or
possibly many similar other forms of those
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molecules that share a similar shape and
are just slightly different, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to the rare cannabinoids,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about like the
biosynthetic pathways that these mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: and that the cannabis plant, that the
pathways that they go through to create
[SPEAKER_02]: these molecules, they are done by enzymes,
which are like little machines,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I mentioned earlier, that do chemical
reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those little machines are not always
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can make mistakes and they can create
like little off byproducts and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they just will create a
certain amount of like little amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is one of the differences
between isolated extracts and like whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant or whole or whole mushroom,
whole fungus extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whole fungus extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that you're not going to like eliminate
any of those like mistakes or just like
[SPEAKER_02]: trace amounts that are slightly,
slightly different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, this is like an example
you brought up earlier with DMT,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's the different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what you're,
when people talk about the different types
[SPEAKER_02]: of DMT, I think there's like red and all
these different like versions versus like
[SPEAKER_02]: the crystal versus like an oil,
you're talking about like different like
[SPEAKER_02]: slight modifications or derivatives that
are present in the plant in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in smaller amounts than the other
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that psilocybin or psilocin
would be no different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there would be small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure possibly it's already
been found.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't, I haven't seen it in the
literature, but I think it's quite
[SPEAKER_02]: possible or very, very possible that it's
there and it exists and that in all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains, it's that there are
complementary molecules present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a piece of what's different
between all of these different strains of
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms is what else is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the psilocybin content that's
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the psilocybin content can vary
between these different strands of
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms, absolutely, but that they also
have other complementary molecules inside
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have like ideas of what I think that
they could be, but I would be really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really excited to look at it, hopefully
one day in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when comparing the microdose permanence
of change to a macrodose permanence of
[SPEAKER_00]: change, would you suggest that there's any
difference in permanence between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties or two thresholds of dosages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we talk about like the benefits of
microdosing stay with us and then perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their attributes fade away and
that happens with potentially different
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes with a macrodose and
potentially they, you know, some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that the fading of the
benefits are like on par with each other
[SPEAKER_00]: or that they last differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a super, super hard question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I would think that they're more
just different tools, different tools for
[SPEAKER_02]: different uses and different advantages,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because on one hand, I think that there is
a huge benefit in that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: have experienced the huge benefit from a
profound experience, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that is life altering and life
changing, but that is very subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that I've read people's
experiences with microdoses where they
[SPEAKER_02]: have had a profound experience for them on
a microdose, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everything in this world is
subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that I think it's a very
difficult question because I think so much
[SPEAKER_02]: of that has to do with the individual
person, what they're seeking from this and
[SPEAKER_02]: also maybe even just a little bit about
their neurochemistry or their like
[SPEAKER_02]: specific neurodiversity because I think
you mentioned at the beginning of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are different doses of microdoses
for people who experience like certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people are sensitive and that's going to
be true for the benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more thing I want to hit on before
we go to the second break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're all pretty familiar with
cannabis tolerance and that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in THC regularly, your receptors
can stay full up and perhaps even get
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with psilocybin, if you take mushrooms
on day one and you take them on day two,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to take more on day
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I understand from the
literature, it's not really tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a different mechanism,
but I have no way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you kind of teach us a bit about
what that's like to take mushrooms day one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then day two and the fact that you
need more?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually tolerance is in reference to
the receptors, which is why I think
[SPEAKER_02]: usually this is a different form or a
different mechanism of tolerance because
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to mushrooms or any of the
serotonergics, it's actually linked to the
[SPEAKER_02]: enzyme that breaks it down, which is
called monoamine oxidase.
[SPEAKER_02]: This enzyme takes the molecule and adds
and makes it inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It inactivates the molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first day that you would take
mushrooms, like let's say your body has
[SPEAKER_02]: like five of these enzymes to break it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, your body would have like
50, like tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because you have so many of these
enzymes, it would like immediately break
[SPEAKER_02]: it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's a different mechanism
because it's linked to breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule into something inactive rather
than being linked to changing the number
[SPEAKER_02]: of receptors that the molecule is binding
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last question, I just stumbled
into this question, so I may not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: ask it scientifically accurately,
but you mentioned the MAOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recall like back in my college days,
I was taking St. John's wort for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that taking mushrooms was
not having the same kind of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember at the time thinking,
being told, oh, it's because the St.
[SPEAKER_00]: John's wort is an MAO inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking MAO inhibitors lessens the
potency of a whole category of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know if I'm asking that
question right, but I'm sure you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you talk a little bit about MAO
inhibitors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's actually very, it's very
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something a PSA, it's very
dangerous to mix different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonergic molecules, specifically MAOI
or monoamine oxidase and MAOI inhibitors
[SPEAKER_02]: and serotonergic agonists, which is what
mushrooms are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what LSD is as well, because there is
something called serotonin syndrome that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get if you overload the serotonin
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very rare to be able to do that
if you were just using one, but it's way
[SPEAKER_02]: more likely to happen if you were using
more than one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, I'm going to stop talking about
that now, but it exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more likely, I have never heard
about that, that it would decrease your
[SPEAKER_02]: ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in theory, taking something that
is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor would
[SPEAKER_02]: turn that enzyme off, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would inhibit that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in theory, you would actually have
more of the mushrooms present still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, that's the premise of
ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ayahuasca, if you eat DMT,
it gets metabolized so quickly that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why ayahuasca is a very
complicated mixture, and it's different
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the person in place,
the shaman who's creating it, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different in a bunch of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main ingredients that go into it
are a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that
[SPEAKER_02]: then allows the DMT to not be metabolized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say it's almost the opposite
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But perhaps, because you were taking St.
John's wort, perhaps it was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing the level of monoamine oxidase
that was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it has an inhibitor in it,
it has this reactionary effect in your
[SPEAKER_02]: body, or the homeostatic effect that then
your body upregulated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was a fun aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis folks are innovators and problem
solvers, and we like to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you developed a tool, technique,
or plant that you want to protect and
[SPEAKER_00]: monetize?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll likely want legal representation
that is experienced, accessible,
[SPEAKER_00]: and shares your values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and planet law represents a wide
variety of clients who choose to respect
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment while pursuing their
business goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you invented a machine or gizmo that
you're bringing to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you discover a breakthrough
environmentally friendly pesticide or
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer formulation that you're about
to start selling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you bred a cannabis plant with
attributes not found anywhere else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Dale Hunt and his plant and
planet team have established genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: patents in over 30 countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working to help entrepreneur scientists
throughout the life sciences, plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: planet represents environmentally positive
clients in cannabis and other botanicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, water purification, clean energy,
emulsions, and medical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and planet helps people protect what
they've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an early stage company with an
established idea and are in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: fundraising, often the investors require
intellectual property protections happen
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and planet can be your sole
representation, or they can integrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: your existing legal team and plug in their
specialties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant and planet is made of scientists,
lawyers, with a real passion for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: inventions, and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the scientific and legal depth
to help you establish patent protections
[SPEAKER_00]: for your great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friendly, qualified, and honorable legal
representation is available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact plant and planet law today to
start the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email info at plantandplanet.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's plant and planet law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our clients make the planet better.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend blunt branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.

[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content on polyculture
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the
history of cannabis medicine around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
solvent-less extraction, and Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business, even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to youtube.com forward slash shango
los or click on the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to do it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is pharmacologist, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here's the big finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first set, we learned a lot about
how the serotonin cycle interacts with
[SPEAKER_00]: psilicin and also with the endocannabinoid
system, little bit about how dopamine
[SPEAKER_00]: reacts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we talked about the
different thresholds for dosage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanics, and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this third set, though,
we're going to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: applications for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to point out that this really isn't
an episode about the spiritual
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship and communication
psychological benefits of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, there is a lot to say about
that, but we're really talking more about
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological mechanics today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that information on the psychology
benefits, the psychological benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking mushrooms, you can pick that up
elsewhere, or maybe I'll do a show about
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really what we're talking
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start, though, Miyabi,
with I know that you're a big fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: taking psilocybin and cannabis together
because they're synergistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you go ahead and kind of explain why
you see them as being such good friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the systems are complementary,
and there's so much overlap and interplay
[SPEAKER_02]: between the endocannabinoid system and the
serotonin system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's clear, it's interesting because
there's almost no research that are done
[SPEAKER_02]: together on cannabis and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's very, very limited research on
how the systems, when they're activated
[SPEAKER_02]: together, in humans, that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is tons and tons of information
out there in the real world community of
[SPEAKER_02]: people who use mushrooms and cannabis
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, they are a potentiating or
they're synergistic, which means that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use less of both of them to achieve a
strong effect or that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily, you know, one doesn't
necessarily just like strengthen the
[SPEAKER_02]: other, but that they complement each other
in such a way that the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits can be greater.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're used together at smaller
doses than when they're alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, I think it's interesting
and I obviously understand why,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's difficult to study such,
it's complicated to study cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's complicated to study mushrooms,
and there's so many molecules in both
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that it's incredible and worth
talking about that their benefits can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one of the main things that
people talk about is about how there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some negative effects to both cannabis and
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that in general, you can limit those
negative effects by using less of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, using less of any drug is
beneficial for you in the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think that it's crazy and I
would love to see more research on the
[SPEAKER_02]: synergy between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it's very explainable in terms of
how I mentioned earlier, the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cells in the brain and the
brain cells that fire together also
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a way that that makes sense that
they're complementary and that actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been a recent, it was a recent paper
that showed that if you use cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly, you have an increased number of
those receptor, the receptor dimers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the two receptors together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the serotonin receptor with the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mentioning earlier, they come
together and they signal differently when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually very preliminary early,
early evidence that regular cannabis use
[SPEAKER_02]: will increase the number of those two
receptor subtypes together, which is just
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because it's kind of pointing
to or hinting at the idea that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: modify either system to be more
complementary with each other or put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: a different balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on if you're
going to be using mushrooms at what point
[SPEAKER_00]: to start your cannabis use as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be, you know, start before it
comes on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to wait till it comes on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, is there any mechanics going on
there that we want to be aware of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think one of the biggest benefits
has to do with the anti-nausea effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big, in terms of like onset of
using them together, I think that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: something like worth mentioning is that
like mushrooms often cause an upset
[SPEAKER_02]: stomach and cannabis combats upset GI
upset stomach and GI issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing worth mentioning is that because
they potentiate each other, because they
[SPEAKER_02]: work together that way, it is,
you have to be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not something for the first
time ever to do without considering what
[SPEAKER_02]: the dosages are and how they interact with
one another because they certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with one another in a way that
potentiates the total overall effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I've found is really useful
is that you can, because of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: having a shorter duration of action,
if you're smoking it or inhaling it or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dabbing it, vaping it,
it has a shorter duration of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one thing that I think is useful is
that you can almost use cannabis to like
[SPEAKER_02]: as a titrator or something that is a very
subtle alteration of the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that I've seen tons
of people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it isn't talked about and it
isn't studied in the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to study it one day or
for someone to study it because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are different benefits that can
be obtained by using them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that cannabis is biphasic,
meaning consuming some THC reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, but taking more than your
personal threshold makes it anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: causing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms also seem to cause both
relaxation and can cause anxiety too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing that they're biphasic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we focus so much on like
mindset and setting, right, with all
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What effect will using mushrooms and
cannabis together have in regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety creation or secession?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this answer is going to be
entirely based on the experience from
[SPEAKER_02]: others that I've heard and from the theory
of what is interacting with these
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors and these molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when a molecule is biphasic,
usually it means that there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: opposing effect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the second dose, at a higher dose or a
higher threshold, it's possible that that
[SPEAKER_02]: second threshold that causes anxiety is
caused by an imbalance in these signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is possible that that imbalance has
to do with only activating one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: systems at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've seen in personal
experiences and qualitatively of others,
[SPEAKER_02]: in general, they can have a curbing effect
on that anxiety effect when used together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it is also certainly true that it
can cause, if you're unprepared or if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's other environmental factors in
your set and setting, that it could go the
[SPEAKER_02]: other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's hard to say with
certainty that there would be anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that would happen for a certain,
for any specific person in that scenario,
[SPEAKER_02]: in any scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that I do think that it's possible
that they can, at least to a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: extent, curb that effect by having it be
an activation of both systems at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time because they balance each other out.
[SPEAKER_02]: While that's being said, I don't think
that we know enough to say that it
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't also, at times, have the opposing
effect because it's definitely true that
[SPEAKER_02]: it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is definitely one of the
experiences that falls in the personalized
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine approach, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going to have to figure out
what their own biphasic thresholds for
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms and cannabis are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start slow and low and find your own
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're here, I appreciate the
fact you giving me some of these answers
[SPEAKER_00]: to these questions that, honestly,
the science doesn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you're willing to,
you know, take a professional guesstimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your willingness to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is all just an abstract idea
at this point, but there is some very real
[SPEAKER_02]: world applications that are happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we shouldn't ignore the fact
that people do use mushrooms and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: together and that, in general,
there are unexplored options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking all day today about
how mushroom psilocybin interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: serotonin system, which is one of the
reasons why people turn to mushrooms for
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard so many different ideas from
patients about why taking either low or
[SPEAKER_00]: large doses of psilocybin mushrooms helps
their migraines either stopping it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: onset or stopping it once it's already on
or used as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard so many different
strategies, and I don't know if any of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from your perspective, what do you see
as far as the effectiveness that
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin might have in the prevention or
cessation of migraines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's so much evidence in
both the endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned earlier that when you
activate the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the main receptor associated with
psychedelic effects, that you will
[SPEAKER_02]: increase your levels of endocannabinoids
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, I think, is more linked to the
preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: But migraines are associated with clinical
endocannabinoid deficiency, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: theory by Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a theory, but there's a lot of
evidence behind people with migraines and
[SPEAKER_02]: also fibromyalgia and IBS or irritable
bowel syndrome having clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid deficiency, having lower
levels of circulating endocannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_02]: their body, and having this be one of the
reasons why they are sensitized to getting
[SPEAKER_02]: migraines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one possible way that I think
that it modifies it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other way is through the
serotonin system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, some of the most common
migraine medications that are abortive or
[SPEAKER_02]: that get rid of your migraines are
tryptans.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also molecules that activate the
serotonin system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually a very, very similar
mechanism to what the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: agents have as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's slightly different because
the pharmaceutical drugs activate only one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the serotonin receptor subtypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's 1B is the type or 1A.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they only activate one, for the most
part, of the serotonin receptor subtypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very, very different effects
profile and can actually cause rebound
[SPEAKER_02]: migraines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's positive things associated
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do work and abort migraines,
but then there's negative things that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't appear to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: With psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's a dual approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it has to do with the effects of
the 2A, 2C receptor, or perhaps the pan
[SPEAKER_02]: agonism of activating all of the serotonin
system subtypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for both migraine and cluster
headaches, there's a lot of really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really positive evidence of using
mushrooms to either prevent them in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of a long-term usage or abort them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that you are not a medical
doctor and you are not giving medical
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm asking this question specifically
from what you are learning from the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and from your own knowledge of
how the neural network work works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on that information, is there one
strategy for using mushrooms to thwart
[SPEAKER_00]: migraines that seems like it's more likely
to be effective than others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Microdosing for migraines or macrodosing
for migraines or taking it at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: or that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything to add on that topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Migraines are such a complicated disorder
and they're a trigger disorder,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that once you trigger a
migraine attack, there's a prodromal phase
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the pain phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of what the best mechanism is,
I really hope we have that answer in the
[SPEAKER_02]: long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the short term, I can say that I've
known someone who's completely cured
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves of migraines using mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it was somewhat regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that case, I think that somewhat
regular use and the microdose route of
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to use it more regularly may be
beneficial in terms of somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: permanently altering the circuitry that
leads to you triggering your migraines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that there's enough yet
to say, even just in migraines in general
[SPEAKER_02]: and what causes them, because a piece of
migraines is vasculature or the blood flow
[SPEAKER_02]: in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so perhaps in that sense too,
altering it somewhat chronically would be
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really, really good
question and I honestly hope that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: an answer for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll give myself time the rest of my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you are very, very
interested in inflammation and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related to the serotonin system as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there strategies for using mushrooms
or mushrooms and cannabis together to help
[SPEAKER_00]: fight inflammation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the way that this involves
inflammation or the way that mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with inflammation has a lot to do
with, there's a type of inflammation
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not like swelling or like redness
or rashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this type of inflammation is just like
a systemic release of chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammatory factors in the body and in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two places in serotonin,
where serotonin I think plays a big role
[SPEAKER_02]: in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first one is in the GI tract and
the second one's in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And inflammation in the brain can cause
depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one specific subtype of
depression that's caused by inflammation
[SPEAKER_02]: in the brain that actually leads to
decreased levels of serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this case, this would be a way
that perhaps you can rebalance that or
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease the inflammation by supplementing
with more serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's unclear whether the
inflammation causes the decreased
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin or the decreased serotonin
causes the inflammation or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by rebalancing the signaling in your
brain, you can lead to a decreased level
[SPEAKER_02]: of inflammation or the release of these
inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because also in general, this is just a
very, very large general statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in general, inflammation in the brain
is caused by like stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we could potentially,
by decreasing anxiety and stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: then aid in our levels of systemic
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really seems that one of the first
benefits that people get from microdosing
[SPEAKER_00]: is increased resilience to anxiety and
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who I meet that start microdosing,
they're only a couple weeks in before
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like, you know, life isn't
getting me down as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know what the mode of action there
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why that's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's ever been anything
published on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my personal belief is that it has to
do with this low level mimicking of a low
[SPEAKER_02]: level increase in your levels of serotonin
that then kind of allow you to restructure
[SPEAKER_02]: that default and that a lot of people who
begin microdosing for anxiety or for
[SPEAKER_02]: managing stress, you are sensitized to
those pathways that lead to negative
[SPEAKER_02]: thought loops and can spiral down into
negativity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not easy to change your
structuring of your brain that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the part of the book by
Michael Pollan, How to Change Your Mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in many ways, you can use these
microdoses as tools for restructuring the
[SPEAKER_02]: way that you process the things that you
are and aren't stressed about,
[SPEAKER_02]: the level of stress that your body or your
brain takes it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something stressful happens in your day
instead of allowing it to go to this
[SPEAKER_02]: changes everything for the rest of my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going down that entire pathway,
making it more of a habit, let's say to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop that and only allow it to stress you
out to the extent that is more manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not an easy task.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something that is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that takes a lot of
conscious effort and work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that microdosing is a tool to
make it easier for your brain to
[SPEAKER_02]: restructure to that task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to restructuring,
there is just simply optimizing and brain
[SPEAKER_00]: healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's finish with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have talked many times on
shaping fire about the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, especially CBD, cannabidiol,
for its neurogenesis benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the creation of more neurons
especially the dopamine excreting cells
[SPEAKER_00]: that when lost tend to lead to like
Parkinson syndrome and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by taking CBD, we increase our
brain's neuroplasticity and because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now today we're talking about the
neuroplasticity benefits from mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and perhaps neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you talk a little bit just simply
about how microdosing and you can add the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD component if you wish, just makes for
a healthier, younger functioning brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think younger is an interesting,
that's an interesting adjective to use
[SPEAKER_02]: because in general, when we're saying
younger brain, we're talking about more
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic or like less, finished is not the
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our brains are always going to be
changing, but more like random thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: and random connections and less like
solidified and minimal connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why things like in,
in general, when things go away or we
[SPEAKER_02]: lose, we lose certain functionalities,
a piece of that has to do with our brain
[SPEAKER_02]: not activating those pathways anymore or
those, or making those connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the things that
mushrooms help and that by activating the
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin system in the way that it does,
which is pan activation all over,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really are sort of like stimulating
your, your litter, you're quite literally
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically stimulating a giant system in
the brain that kind of just like
[SPEAKER_02]: jumpstarts and has all of these down,
there's all these downstream things that
[SPEAKER_02]: it will interact with and that it will
then activate.
[SPEAKER_02]: To kind of like give a bunch of different
new pathways, a, a boost or at least like
[SPEAKER_02]: a little activation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that can do is it can start a,
you know, it can start a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_02]: like next level things that can lead to
like eventually differences in the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: like your openness, I guess would be one
way of putting it, like how you were
[SPEAKER_02]: describing about having like a better way
of reacting to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I would say is like,
is like openness in general and
[SPEAKER_02]: flexibility and that those things are all
generally speaking associated with being
[SPEAKER_02]: happier, which is also generally
associated with serotonin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be mechanistically the way
that I think that, that this is working is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it facilitates and encourages new
connections because it creates and like
[SPEAKER_02]: sparks these new connections that
otherwise wouldn't have been stimulated
[SPEAKER_02]: because there would be limited places
where serotonin would be released because
[SPEAKER_02]: as we get older, our brains are less and
less plastic and we release serotonin in
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more specific areas or in
pathways that have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cultivated as opposed to
introducing a new molecule that mimics
[SPEAKER_02]: serotonin that will activate a bunch of
different pathways that otherwise maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: would not have been activated together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's a really great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me a lot of like use it or lose
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as we get older, if we don't stay
physical, we lose some of our mobility and
[SPEAKER_00]: our options become more limited,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that that would work the
same way with a neural network too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not stimulating these various
networks, eventually we're doing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing every day and things are becoming a
little more rogue and we start to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: options because some of those neural
pathways that give us more mental options
[SPEAKER_00]: get pruned or less deep and so by using,
by microdosing, we're just giving
[SPEAKER_00]: everything enough stimulation to keep them
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they quite literally do get pruned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our brain cells look a lot like trees and
yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look a lot like trees and they do
quite literally end up, the purpose of
[SPEAKER_02]: that is to be more efficient, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to deliver the messages down the same
pathways faster and more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely, no, that's a good analogy
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Miyabi, thank you so much for
joining me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was everything I hoped it would be
and every time we talk, I learn so much
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get so much fan mail for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my account, people really enjoying
your ability to take these pretty complex
[SPEAKER_00]: biological mechanisms and put them into
examples that anybody can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you going down this path
with me about mushrooms today and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate both your expertise and good
cheer with all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks so much for having me and
also for going down the rabbit hole of
[SPEAKER_02]: abstract molecular pharmacology because
there's definitely so much more to be
[SPEAKER_02]: found out of this unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love talking about this and that's
why I love talking to people who are open
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, kind of approaching it from
different angles, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, dear listener, are interested
in knowing more about Miyabi, there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple ways or three ways for you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far, the best is to start with Miyabi's
Instagram account because while there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other social media accounts come and go,
the Instagram seems to be pretty steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Miyabi PHD, M-I-Y-A-B-E-P-H-D,
Miyabi PHD, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, Miyabi has a gargantuan
following on TikTok, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a six figure following that you can follow
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you love Miyabi's explanations,
you're going to love them even more with
[SPEAKER_00]: like 3D models in their hands being
manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is also Miyabi PHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are curious to know more about
Miyabi's day job, you can go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: website for their company, Smokinol,
and that's S-M-O-K-E-N-O-L dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these days, we'll talk about
Miyabi's invention for extraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in hearing more
about mushrooms, mushrooms and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that, there are a handful
of earlier Shaping Fire episodes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can check out, going all the way back to
Shaping Fire episode 22 with Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_00]: Russo on treating brain injuries with
mushrooms and cannabis, episode 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 77 also with Dr. Russo on migraine
therapy using cannabis and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 70 about cannabis, mushrooms and
terpenes for optimum health with guests,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Russo, Tony Verzura,
Jeff Chilton and Berner focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese medicinal mushrooms rather than
psychedelic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, very recently, episode 76
with Adam Bramledge comparing different
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin microdosing protocols.
