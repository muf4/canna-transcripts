[SPEAKER_00]: I first met Ethan Russo on a tour he led
of his home garden right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really amazed by the beautiful fruit
that he was growing and that he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it all organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist with a long term interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has led a second career focused on the
therapeutic application of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: other herbal treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has busted sods since childhood and was
the founder of the Blackfoot Organic Fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: and Flower Operation, one of the first
state certified organic farms in Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sold exotic produce at the Missoula
Farmers Market for two years in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has lived on Bashong for ten years and
slowly turned his available quarter acre
[SPEAKER_00]: into more of a strictly organic vegetable
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's please give a warm welcome to Dr.
Ethan Russo.
Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go all over the world giving talks about
medicinal plants, but it's nice to just
[SPEAKER_04]: drive a little bit up the road and be able
to speak to fellow Bashong people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, this is the introductory slide
and you'll see a picture of a book there
[SPEAKER_04]: by Michael Phillips, The Ballistic
Cordure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that we're talking about today
is derived from that book.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I was reading, I think it's a fantastic
book and there's tremendous detail in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only criticism I'm going to have is
that for the person who just wants to know
[SPEAKER_04]: how to do it, it's a little bit hard to
pick out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you buy the book, you may find yourself
making notes for how you'd like to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to help with that by distilling
some of the key ingredients of the spray
[SPEAKER_04]: and the proportions that are needed in the
handout that we receive.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have questions about any of this,
my email is up there pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Ethan Russo at contest.net and
I'd be happy to go from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's a little bit of a delay.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, I'm flying to Nova Scotia
tomorrow and Newfoundland on Friday for
[SPEAKER_04]: other talks, not the same one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, next please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, that is a picture of me by Alex
Beach Winters, who to me was just this
[SPEAKER_04]: crabby old lady, but I found out later
that she was in her youth quite an active
[SPEAKER_04]: leftist in New England politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess I had an affinity for fruit
even then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So key questions that people have,
why do you go to the trouble of growing it
[SPEAKER_04]: organically?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one answer is because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is because we think it's important
and there are arguments from people all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the world about whether nutritionally
it's better to grow organically.
It is.
And then there's the whole environmental
aspect that you heard a little bit about
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was critically important to me that I
do things organically and I've heard for
[SPEAKER_04]: decades from people that it's impossible
to grow good fruit without synthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides, which is not true at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for years I was asking everyone,
do you know of a preventive organic spray
[SPEAKER_04]: program that you can just do proactively
to be able to grow good fruit?
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone said, no, that's a nice idea,
but I don't know of any.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then about six years ago, Michael
Phillips came out with this book and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was exactly what the proverbial doctor
ordered, or even the non-doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here are the reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely safer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ecologically sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're working with, rather than against,
against nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of the spray program that we're
going to do, it's going to be okay for the
[SPEAKER_04]: good bugs and repel the bad bugs,
but not necessarily kill anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep things in proper balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sustainable approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there is positive evidence of
nutritional benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes bigger fruit, clearly more of
the secondary metabolites, things like
[SPEAKER_04]: bioflavor humanoids that help prevent
aging and degenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how many people before this can
say my fruit is 100% organic and I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually get some?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we miss one?
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Amazon, it's discounted from the
regular price.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was happy to pay the full price when it
first came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a website that's really good and
there's a blog that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the book in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like me, sometimes he takes a while to
answer his emails, but when I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: questions that weren't handled in the
book, like why won't my quince tree fruit,
[SPEAKER_04]: he will at least give it a try.
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, you have resources here,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a member of the fruit club,
take a picture of your diseased or damaged
[SPEAKER_04]: tree or bush and send it around and you'll
get opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next one, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of organic growing is realizing how
fruit grows in the wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the fruit trees that we have are
designed to grow at the forest edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an environment where there's lots
of stuff that falls off leaves and twigs,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm not a cosmetic gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took the tour of my place,
you would have seen that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily look great, but the results
are really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of that stuff that we
cosmetically rake away is actually good
[SPEAKER_04]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will break down and provide nutrition
and harbor good organisms that need to be
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can promote this by using what are
called ramiel wood chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the thin, two-inch or less
branches from hardwoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can chip these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you get this chipper, you're going
to spend a lot of time beating them in,
[SPEAKER_04]: one by one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be better to have a bigger
chipper if you have a bigger property.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what they look like,
ideally in different shapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like solid nutrition for the
tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be spread just like mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be amazed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a close-up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be amazed how quickly this gets
incorporated into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Primarily, though, we're going to be
talking about this preventive organic
[SPEAKER_04]: spray program that Michael Phillips
developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's it all about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, the idea is a general spray
that's atomic for the plants, providing
[SPEAKER_04]: things it needs and keeping things in
ecological balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is to improve fruit growth,
the vigor, and the nutrients that they
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: When properly done, and my spraying,
he recommends every 7 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: The season starts early here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually start in late February.
[SPEAKER_04]: And go through about now, end of
September.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be one spray late in the season
that helped break down some of the leaves
[SPEAKER_04]: and other stuff that's fallen off the
trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what this will do is remarkably reduce
predation by bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the need in the spray that we're going
to talk about has an anti-feeding
[SPEAKER_04]: property.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sort of tastes bad for the bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll go somewhere else that doesn't
have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not harmful to pollinators.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got plenty of mason bees and other
pollinators in the garden, provided we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have a spring like this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you didn't have a great yield,
welcome to the club that we don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the components of the spray are
anti-fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And goodness knows, in our environment,
that's our biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like peach leaf curl, and black
spot, and roses are really an issue in
[SPEAKER_04]: this locality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that it reduces those
pathogenic disease forming fungi,
[SPEAKER_04]: it improves the mycorrhizal growth in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mycorrhizae are fungi that grow around the
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both get something out of each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fungi have a place to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helps provide nutrients to the tree
itself through the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, this spray will reduce both
bacterial and viral diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the real base to this is pure organic
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's tons of neem oil on the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a grain called ahimsa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to pass this around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to ask you to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like melted butter here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the consistency of butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must have been warmed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because normally, it'll be more grain and
look like butter that's been on the
[SPEAKER_04]: counter for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you buy it in bulk, you can store
it in the refrigerator for months.
[SPEAKER_04]: But longer is the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I do is I buy little bottles like
this and measure out the 75 milliliters,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's five tablespoons, in each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I'm ready to spray,
I just grab one and set it up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: counter and then on the stove to melt the
stove.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've looked going from left to right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the neem oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it looks like in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's warmed up, it looks like that in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need a soap to emulsify it,
break it up into little tiny droplets so
[SPEAKER_04]: it'll spread through the spray and not
float on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is going to be done warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: People ask me if you can store the spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is no, you cannot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be done on the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second component is hydrolyzed fish
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's, again, this is not fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just fish that are ground up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is broken down a little bit with
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more bioavailable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also doesn't smell as bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a distinct product as compared
to fish emulsion that you might be more
[SPEAKER_04]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Neptune.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got the handout,
all this stuff should be on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: including the prices.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get it so the country's
store will carry all this stuff.
And you don't have to be doing a bunch of
mail weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I usually buy gallons of each of these
things to store them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got good shelf life, so it's not
an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, question about those enzymes you're
referring to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those available if you want to make
your own recipe?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it's going to be worth the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have time for questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we go through and then be
happy to answer outstanding issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next one is liquid kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is also hydrolyzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we do have kelp on the beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is made from good stuff and
non-polluted areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The key thing here is this has got
hormonal effects, growth factors,
[SPEAKER_04]: also a lot of trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're primarily using these as foliar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So foliar feeding means they're spreading
on the leaves, but also some on the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next ingredient are beneficial
microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the brand that I've used.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do this three different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one comes pre-mixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can magnify it, because this is a
little bit pricey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can mix this and mix it with a
little bit of molasses and let it ferment
[SPEAKER_04]: again, because this is got a combination
of bacteria and fungi in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let it ferment for a while until it
gets to the right pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can increase the yield
20-fold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can brew this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy it just pre-mixed that can't
be expanded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or for people that want to make compost
tea, they can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, a little bit more labor
intensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a way to end up with this liquid,
and you've got to aerate it for a few
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is very good for plants and can
be used as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because I travel a lot, it's better if
I can just make stuff on the spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, this is blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure it's organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want it sulfur, because that's
going to kill the good bones that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got in the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in the mix because it nourishes
the beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you spray it, they've got
something to grow on for a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, a spreader sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are various of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's called Thermix 70.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the only one I've found that's
listed as organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are various spreader stickers on
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might have to get this one or look
to see if there are others that are common
[SPEAKER_04]: on the market that are really organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I realize I'm not going to be able to
read this too well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to, because we provided
this to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is what we call orchard spray
rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's taken from Michael's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says he didn't have a table like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've scaled this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the way from doing a quart or
pint at once, all the way up to 100
[SPEAKER_04]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a relatively bigger operation in
extreme northern New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he uses 100 gallons spreader on a
tractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you may have that, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got directions for mixing it up that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I use is a little different,
as we'll see next.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the neem again.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a little, used to be a yogurt
maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is passed by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have it for almost 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it shows you the transition from the
green, more solid neem to what it looks
[SPEAKER_04]: like when it's heated up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heating is not that much, 105 degrees
Fahrenheit or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to do anything over 120
degrees Fahrenheit or 50 degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that'll kill the good bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's absolutely necessary that you have
clean water for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, on Vashon, you do that one of two
ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either with good filtered water,
or because if you're on district 19 water,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's chlorinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should set your water out overnight,
so that it can out gas the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, otherwise, it's going to kill the
good bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use distilled water, but it's
going to be way, way too expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got a water filter in the kitchen,
and I've had no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I heat up a bunch of water to something
less than 50 degrees Celsius, because he
[SPEAKER_04]: wants it to heat up, and he's going to
want that more to keep the neem suspended.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very important, and the reason that
we can't store it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about the effect of microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do buy the ProBio, for example,
and want to make your own, this is what
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria,
these are things that you'd find in
[SPEAKER_04]: yogurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do lactobacilli, the fermentation
of vegetables, you've got the same kinds
[SPEAKER_04]: of bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of these, you could drink,
but I'm not recommending that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what it's for.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want your plants to drink it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got, again, these yeasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other beneficial bacterias.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see there, we won't go through the
names.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to make this brew, what you do is you
use three quarters of a cup of the
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial microbes, a quarter cup of
black extract, a gallon, fill the gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: jug up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it at 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit
until the pH is 3.8 or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about a week's worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it'll store for several weeks at
room temperature, and you've got 20 times
[SPEAKER_04]: more for the same price.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like anything else, there's some
investment of time and money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This pH paper is readily accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it from Reentry or maybe the
local stores have it, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just dip the strip in, and when it's
the same color as the 3.8, you're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of kitchen chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I mentioned, you can get the
pre-mix, this bio-ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same box.
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference is this one you won't
multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one won't?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will not multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to just use it as is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this next part is only for the
hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael Phillips is into doing a lot of
herbal teas as an additional supplement to
[SPEAKER_04]: his plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is usually a once-a-year
proposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are things you can find readily
on Vashon.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first did it, I had to go to an
herbally-interested friend's house and get
[SPEAKER_04]: comfrey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I knew that we had horsetails down by
Tramp Harbor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got those, and there are nettles
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't find nettles, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first one is comfrey.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm going to recommend, comfrey's a
really interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is invasive, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the company that used to be
called Horizon Herbs, now called Strictly
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicinal, sells a Russian hybrid comfrey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of its constituents,
the good stuff in it, it's exactly the
[SPEAKER_04]: same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll just grow abundantly every year,
but it won't spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really recommend that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got that scattered through the
garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this does, among other things,
is aerates the soil, and it really
[SPEAKER_04]: recruits calcium from deep in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the spring, you can cut some of
this down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cover it with hot water, and you brew
it for a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this is going to do is serve as
another tonic for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It produces trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has anti-fungal properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very good to add to the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one, horsetail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, if you've got an area of
standing water, or there's a creek nearby,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's have to be horsetails.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're readily identifiable.
[SPEAKER_04]: What this does, it's very strong in
silica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Silica is what's in sand, but this is in a
form where you can spray it on the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it really toughens up the plant,
and helps prevent predation from bugs that
[SPEAKER_04]: would like to suck that plant dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the main ingredient there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one is the nettle tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be hard-core to do this,
because once this stuff remets,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be stored at ambient temperature,
outside temperature, as long as it's out
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sun, and I just use it throughout
the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what I've done here is I fill
up five-gallon buckets, food grade,
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can get at one of the hardware
stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, dump the hot water on it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be chlorine-free or filtered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it sit for a week, and then you can
store it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a quarter of each, add it to the mix
throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to go to the step,
but you can put airlocks on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look pretty good until they start
throwing fungi in them, which looks bad,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you wonder why you'd be spraying this
on your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it's good fungi rather than bad
fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what the mix looks like all
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of muddy, but I think you'll
appreciate that you don't see globs of oil
[SPEAKER_04]: on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually well-mixed, particularly if
you've got that water temperature right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll just see tiny droplets of mead
throughout, and the bottom will look just
[SPEAKER_04]: like the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just some notes about things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what we need to mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I had pointed out, he recommends every
one to two weeks throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it every two weeks, so I can't
manage once a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: You drop the fish, which is a fertilizer,
of course, for the nitrogen component.
[SPEAKER_04]: You drop that about the beginning of June.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the various herbal teas from the
time that, when the nettle flowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the time to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the time to start doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do that through the beginning of
September, so I'm done with that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: The meanwhile should be refrigerated,
particularly if you're going to buy the
[SPEAKER_04]: bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you leave it out and you warm it to get
it out of the bottle, you can't do that
[SPEAKER_04]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'd really recommend is get them out
if you think it's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do pialans, which last me a couple of
seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pour out 75 milliliters in these little
jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go in the fridge, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just take one out, and I'm ready to
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the fish and kelp should be
hydrolyzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect of microbes, you can use as is,
or you can multiply them, or you can make
[SPEAKER_04]: your own compost tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blackstrap, keep in mind, if you're
not used to working with molasses,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's very tarry stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be warmed up, too,
in the water to get it to mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's going to glob up in the
bottom of your bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're worried about how all this
smells, what I'd like to say is that the
[SPEAKER_04]: complete mix with the fish and the meat
smells like a Thai restaurant in full
[SPEAKER_04]: production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you drop the fish, it just smells a
little bit nutty.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really nothing bad about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The herbal teas are something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get pretty rank due to the
development of butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Butyric acid is harmless, but it smells
like vomit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're sensitive, you might want to get
help with that or forget about the teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to go through this in
detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is under your handout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, these are sources for the
various components.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get a kickback from any of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did was look at the pictures really
carefully in Michael's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: My thinking was, well, he uses this brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try and do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are others.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really would be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, again, we don't want fish
emulsion in one high specialized fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are only a few of the neem oils that
are really organic and are whole nut that
[SPEAKER_04]: are made the way the Ahimsa is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee you, you don't want to go to
the trouble of doing this with the wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that comes up is how much
trouble is this really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how important is your fruit to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that I've seen a lot of
fruit operations on the island,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's a lot of mummy barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I was doing this, we inherited some
bluebird bushes, and then I added to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really weren't getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the birds and the mummy barrier,
there was almost no production.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you'll see, we're doing really well
now with no mummy barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason is because of this program.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the right setup, I can get this down
to where I'm doing an hour every two
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's symptom nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the time I say, okay, I'm going to
spray until I'm done and things are set an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour to air out is an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: An hour every two weeks to me is a good
investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think well worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some initial outlay.
[SPEAKER_04]: For this stuff, some ingredients are
pricey, but to me again, well worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of other equipment, I use a
backpack sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even tell you how many trees I've
got that I'm spraying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like 12 or 14, even a bunch of
berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all on a quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the berries and roses and fruit trees
that I want to spray with one four gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: application every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started out with this, the Solo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured out a German sprayer should be
really reliable, but I've gone through one
[SPEAKER_04]: a season.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a manual one where you're spraying
with the right hand and you're pumping off
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time below.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid that when these go,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be serviced, but the service is
like 40 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take one of these apart and put
it back together in less than a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it goes bad, unless you've got
abundant time on your hands, it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: worth the trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through two of these and another
similar manual brand before I got wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do get this, you do want to spring
for the better shoulder pads and the waist
[SPEAKER_04]: band.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're like me of a certain age and
have a bad back, this weighs 40 pounds
[SPEAKER_04]: when it's full.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to distribute that weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you, I've never hurt my back
doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've hurt my back plenty of other ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to get one of these pads
and stick it on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, a little bit more investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sort of a purist.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of months ago, I got an automatic
car for the first time in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't because I wanted that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because manual cars really don't
exist in this country anymore if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting something new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt the same way about the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could do it manually, that's what I
thought you should do, but I was wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: because it breaks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided, okay, I'm going to spend the
extra 20 bucks or whatever it is and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get an electric sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lithium battery and all of a
sudden, you're not doing this all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also is much steadier and much faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's not the wear and tear,
I think it's going to last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs a little more, but boy,
the time I actually am spraying is half as
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cleanup is much easier too because you
can just put some warm water in there and
[SPEAKER_04]: let it rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the new one I've been using and so
far, I'm really happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, time's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a true story behind this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out there one morning and saw one of
the neighbors looking at me and getting
[SPEAKER_04]: really worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took off her mask and I said,
don't worry, it's all organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure she was appeased,
but I ran into my realtor a few days
[SPEAKER_04]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, well, which house was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, the one down the hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, oh, they're just ranchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I wasn't supposed to worry.
The real reason is this stuff's absolutely
safe.
As I pointed out, you can drink it.
[SPEAKER_04]: God knows why you want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact is, you don't need to be getting
this on your clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does smell when the fish is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found after the first couple of sprays
that, gee, well, now I get to wash these
[SPEAKER_04]: clothes and take a second shower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tie-back suit costs nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you can get a bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just cover up and when I'm going to take
this stuff off, my clothes are fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to breathe the fumes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife took that picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does all this do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting in the winter, it really provides
a good wake up for the plant, get things
[SPEAKER_04]: started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you do this, you're really
going to notice that you have butt break
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you spray and then all of a
sudden things go wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the rain and getting a little sun
in March, that's a factor, but boy,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's different once you start spraying.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the apples, I noticed that they were
much larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flavor was better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not had any codling moth or apple
maggot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should mention that the year before I
started this, I tried the little net
[SPEAKER_04]: things where you go around on all the
little fruit and put these baggies on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated that job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent five hours doing it and it didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really unhappy and I never do that
kind of thing again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would much rather spend an hour every
two weeks doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bags don't do anything except
supposedly keep the bugs out.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the blueberries, I've mentioned
already, totally eliminated the mungberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed to be rampant everywhere
else and it was a marked increase in
[SPEAKER_04]: yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the pears, if you spray on a day
where there's bright sun, which is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be any time of July and August here,
you have a chance that you get a
[SPEAKER_04]: photosensitivity reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: On pear trees, I find some of the leaves
get black spots and it won't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roses, not usually thought of as a fruit,
but we have a terrible black leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not eradicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still there, but it's controlled.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got really good roses now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do spray those.
[SPEAKER_04]: The raspberries, better size and yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strawberries, bigger, better tasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants I highly recommend you see pictures
of in a few minutes is an Illinois
[SPEAKER_04]: Evergreen mulberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's tried mulberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not well known to most modern Americans,
but it grows beautifully here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't mind growing it next to a
walkway because it stains, but lovely
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes an incredible pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful for fresh eating and really
likes to spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: I now have persimmons, the Sager
Persimmon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see it coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Blue Crab Passionflower have gotten
fruit a couple of times and really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's show some evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Illinois Evergreen mulberry.
I can't grow it to be 31 feet,
but you can prune it all you want and just
keep growing.
What kind of mulberry?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
What kind of mulberry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Illinois Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rain tree has it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try and keep it so that I can reach the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be picking a small
fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I admire people for their sweet cherries,
but I try to keep it within reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an immature mulberry on the right
and a mature one on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try and pick them when they're
all black, but the birds will be blinding
[SPEAKER_04]: for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really like these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that a woman, a mylar skier,
her tape works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our dog also likes these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided that I'll just share with the
birds that Robbins love these and I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: pick them up off the ground so the dog
hasn't had a good year for mulberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got mulberries in the colander and
this was my best year on the apricots.
[SPEAKER_04]: This year I only got, I think they're
really pretty, but I only got three this
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody get any apricots?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, next.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one apple tree left and it's
Cortland.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be a biennial bearer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily supposed to be,
but I end up bringing bags of them to the
[SPEAKER_04]: athletic club because it's more than we
can eat, but we'll see next when we close
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any bugs because of the spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: No scab this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this year a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not much at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next please.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two wheelbarrows like that off this
one small tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the passive flora,
passion flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good for something that's supposed
to be a tropical plant from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next please.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the quince.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pleased to say I've been frustrated
with this tree for several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got about 10 this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason it wants to just grow the
ones on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably need a ladder for those.
Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blueberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the best weather I can get a pint every
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next is what they look like in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you didn't have any other reasons to
go up to the berries they're really pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: a few weeks from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the blossoming pears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blossoming apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cortland again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quince.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a native plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buffalo currants or rives a little
round.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flowers are pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't really get a lot of fruit
this year but normally there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: About this size.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very tasty berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real different than the European
black currants which has sort of a weird
[SPEAKER_04]: after taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most Americans don't like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, boy, normally a tremendous amount
of sour cherries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year it was a bust.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tree was just covered with blossoms
but fruit sap was minimal just because of
[SPEAKER_04]: the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, the same hero I got because it's
supposed to be one of the only oriental
[SPEAKER_04]: pursuits that'll ripen in this climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the slowest growing thing I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get it from a rain tree the first
year I set it out it leafed out about a
[SPEAKER_04]: week before it froze.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came back the next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barely grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And slowly, slowly it's gotten to the
point where it's now about 15 feet high
[SPEAKER_04]: and in the seventh season I got fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year there were about 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find my pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably on my old phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really a beautiful tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: In all seasons it's lovely green.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got these peculiar looking blossoms
and end up with fruit that's yellow orange
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people may not be familiar with
persimmons but this will be ready
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere after Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sort of the capper of the season
and the fruit will be ready after the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves have already fallen off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got these yellow orange fruit on
the bare tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really pretty striking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's the run through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said I'd be happy to answer
questions.
I have a couple.
One, when using the silica do you find
it's better to plant with a foliar spray
or a soil wrench?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all of this stuff can be sprayed
around the base of the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to do that particularly early in the
season I think it's going to help either
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Michael in the book mentions that both
areas of it, it goes on the branches and
[SPEAKER_04]: trunks too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have an advantage to the
tree or the berry wherever you spray it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, what we're doing is beefing it up,
helping with its natural protections and
[SPEAKER_04]: providing some of the stuff that the good
buds and fungi that may not be in full
[SPEAKER_04]: supply on a given year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we've got a challenging
climate here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone from the rainiest winter and
spring on record to one of the driest
[SPEAKER_04]: summers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should point out too, with a mulch,
I've got an eight inch layer of mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've watered maybe three times this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take a Darwinian approach to this
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want those trees to have deep roots,
get what they need in terms of nutrition
[SPEAKER_04]: and water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not supplying water unless you really,
really think of eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just use wood chips for mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ramiel wood chips are the best,
but you've got to have, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: less than two inch diameter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good bit of labor to chip these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise you want to use hardwoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alder would be the best around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you don't want cedar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cedar's got a bunch of growth inhibitors
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, hardwood chips are going to be
the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: So well water is good for, I mean,
it's... If you had to test it,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it doesn't have anything bad in it
that's going to kill the buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I'd say sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I pick raspberries, I don't wash
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just eat them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've been spraying with this
stuff, can you just eat the raspberries?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to taste weird?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I've experimented a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've eaten from the same tree I sprayed in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, there's nothing toxic in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using one or two teaspoons of the safer,
I'm sorry, the browner soap for four
[SPEAKER_04]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never tasted anything weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have eaten from the tree the same
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I eat straight from the tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like raspberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you wash them and then do I... What
about apples?
Do you wash apples?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're...
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they're later in the season
and there's probably dust and other stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely wash them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it also helped them last
longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different than a berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think berries were for foraging.
[SPEAKER_04]: We eat them straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: More ends up in my stomach than in the
tail generally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a mummy berry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mummy berry is a fungal disease of
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's ugly and makes it inedible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really knocks down the yield and,
you know, it's a good thing to prevent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rampant around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's shriveled up and in its worst state
you see white fungal-like stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A question about in the springtime with
the spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to be careful about bloom
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, could the trees be in full bloom
and still spray?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it every stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, different trees are going to be
at different stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael addresses that in the book and
says you might want to work around full
[SPEAKER_04]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the fact is I've never had any problem
with pollination here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it was due to weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spray doesn't do anything about a
cold, rainy spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've really watched this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sprayed, I've gone out the same day
and seen plenty of pollinators working on
[SPEAKER_04]: the same stuff that got sprayed a few
hours before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So clearly it's not shorting them from
their assigned duties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a question about your recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like on the four-gallon line here,
do you start with four gallons of water
[SPEAKER_03]: and then add these other things to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: How I do it is something along the lines
of the following.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heat up the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put in the molasses and get that mixed
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The neem goes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so the water is warmed already.
[SPEAKER_04]: The neem goes in while it's still warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's already been mixed with the broader
soap so that it emulsifies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I run downstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put in the fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put in the microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put in the kelp and the spreader
sticker.
[SPEAKER_04]: That goes in the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I add the herbal teas if I'm using
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I fill up the rest with warm water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you go straight to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't let it sit because you want to
keep things warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, when it comes out of the
sprayer, it's going to cool down
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to kill anything that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you don't want to do is have the
water too hot so you're killing your
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't mix it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just add the water to get the sprayer
full.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much water?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm missing something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a four gallon sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the ingredients as it's listed in
the table and then you fill it the rest of
the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the tea, I use a quart of each.
[SPEAKER_04]: A quarter of comfrey, nettle, and
horsetail.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you determine how much to spray any
particular plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got small blueberry heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got big trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably can't overdose them,
but how do you make sure you get enough?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly with the electric sprayer,
it comes out nicely and evenly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it so that it looks like I'm getting
some on each leaf and fruit and on the
[SPEAKER_04]: stems and a little bit on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, you can't have too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Occasionally, I've had a plant where I
really wanted to have a lot to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing this pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the trees are bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not getting the tops, but the
plant will still benefit in some respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of leeway on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's glad to have any help that you can
give.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly, this does help.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't worry too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a curious question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is neem oil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Neem is a nut from India.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of ingredients, it's got a lot of
what I call tritercanoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are like essential oils,
but they're thicker, more oily,
[SPEAKER_04]: more solid at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing about the book is that if you
really want to dig in, he's got a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: explanation for the reasons behind this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you can dig out the references that
are in the back of the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it down to a very scientific
level if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it grows in Florida, but probably
not right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a fertilizer program in
addition to the spray?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exception is I use an organic
fertilizer in the spring and fall just
[SPEAKER_04]: with the cool grays.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not native here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a special mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, from rain tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for acid plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, it's got mycorrhizal
organisms in them that should help with
[SPEAKER_04]: the growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't provided compost or nitrogen in
any form or anything over the last seven
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds with nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you spray on rainy days?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to spray unless you've got
four hours for things to set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this year isn't a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some years it's really a problem,
particularly in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, say it's going to be sunny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to go out early and get
it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, if it's bright sun in the
afternoon, it's possible it gets some
[SPEAKER_04]: photosensitivity reactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this would be because they're
going to be droplets on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That acts like a magnifying glass to the
sunlight that can burn the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this magnification.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means that the enzymes are breaking it
down to some extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be considered like a
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's treated with enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it means is that the plant can get
benefits of the nitrogen or other
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients really quickly because it
doesn't have to break them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the benefit of not smelling as bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to tell you it's great,
but it's a lot better with fish emulsion,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is really positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: With wood shavings or sawdust,
we have an excess of them at our house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that work or would that need to be
defined?
[SPEAKER_04]: This clumps up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can absorb enough water on the top
that you don't get enough below it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better to have chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the book gives you a detail about
the size of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to comment on this,
it should be from the earth where it's
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of nitrogen-carbon balances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that too much carbon to be putting in a
tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have sawdust, it'll recruit
nitrogen on its own and make a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant stuff that would be down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the chips, they're going to last a
lot longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use someone's slide notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to have that excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat your email address?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethan Marizzo at comcast.matin.
I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compost is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been very good at it,
mainly because I'm negligent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Theoretically, it should be turned all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go down there to pick first.
I don't go down there to turn the compost
file.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I admire people that have the discipline
to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not worked out terrifically for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, as I said, I'm not sure I need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the spray and the thick layer of
mulch, it seems to take care of
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the wild, there are fruit trees that
produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have somebody dumping cow
manure on them all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this kind of growing
technique more resembles what should be
[SPEAKER_04]: occurring naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll point out that the soil at my place
was extremely well balanced when I bought
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't buy the house until the soil
test came back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after living in Montana for 24 years
with horrendous conditions in the near
[SPEAKER_04]: Arctic, it's paradise.
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't talked about disease-resistant
varieties, which I think is the great
[SPEAKER_07]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, you bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did in relation to the peach leaf curl.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the others, I mainly made my
selections based on what's going to work
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get that information from Dr. Bob
or there's a good lot of information in
[SPEAKER_04]: the rain tree catalog or one green world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But things are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be that long before we grow on
pomegranate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to put in a pitch for Liberty
apples, which are extra nutritious.
[SPEAKER_07]: No apple scabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really resistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a prediction as well.
It tastes great.
It's holistic every year.
This is its second year and it's gorgeous
and it's full of fruit.
No apple scabs.
It's beautiful.
Other questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you mix up the spray and you're like a
typical American, would it be better to
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of putting in one piece of them,
say you want to put in like a quart or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an optima, the spray out of those
ingredients that are added in it?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you add more neem oil, would it make it
better?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time that you do a double dose in
the winter and less spray in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help break things down.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do double the fish in the fall that
help break down the residual leaves and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, I don't see any need.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have too much neem, you stand a
chance of it cooling down and gumming up
[SPEAKER_04]: your sprayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I've got a system that's worked for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't play with it that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go with the standard recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have to replenish your chips
annually?
No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: The eight inches have lasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm in my third season.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can dig down and see what's
going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I haven't had any water,
so I think it's still working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first moved here, we had a
groundsman where I put mulch down in
[SPEAKER_04]: various areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd come and work and then the mulch
would disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a huge argument about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost got fired that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not working for me at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've got a crew that leaves the
mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tried to convince me that mulch was
bad.
Also, that you couldn't do all this
organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, an angry dog helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you can try an eight-foot fence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, an electric fence would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you live in Ellisport by chance?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm married here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a guy who feeds the
raccoons.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't need any encouragement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious about the dog because my wife
didn't move for five months when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a deer in the yard regularly eating
my newly planted trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stopped when the dogs arrived.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just looking in the book about the
mummy berry business and talking about the
[SPEAKER_07]: little spores that appear on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see that this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a couple other things you can do
about mummy berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to disturb the material around
the bush.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to replenish pine needles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably each season.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will help.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the spray does a great job of the
mummy berry as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I don't have to step up and take it
away?
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is break it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is the spores land.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's described in the book, what you can
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you mulch all the way out to the leaf
line on the tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, my beds are full.
[SPEAKER_04]: The surrounding soil is also going to
retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the least amount that you'd
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
