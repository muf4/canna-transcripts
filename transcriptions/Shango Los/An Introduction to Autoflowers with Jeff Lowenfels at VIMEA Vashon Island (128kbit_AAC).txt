[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Lowenfels is author of the
award-winning trilogy of soil science
[SPEAKER_03]: books titled Teeming with Microbes,
The Organic Gardener's Guide to the Soil
[SPEAKER_03]: Food Web, Teeming with Nutrients,
The Organic Gardener's Guide to Optimizing
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Nutrition, and Teeming with Fungi,
The Organic Grower's Guide to Mycorrhiza.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are seminal cornerstone soil science
books if you have not read them,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff writes the longest-running gardening
column in the U.S., running 42 years now
[SPEAKER_03]: for the Alaska Dispatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also a lawyer and former TV and radio
show host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff discovered the amazing autoflowering
canvas plant and decided to go all in and
[SPEAKER_03]: write a book about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book comes out in October,
but he agreed to come and talk with us
[SPEAKER_03]: here on Bashland Island well before it
comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're especially appreciative because
Jeff flew himself all the way down here
[SPEAKER_03]: from Alaska just to chat with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I think it was Jack Ben.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, thank you very much, but I have
arthritis and I don't deserve that either.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to unplug this and hopefully if
the thing dies I can put it back in again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every time I sit through one of
these things, I sit there and I listen
[SPEAKER_06]: carefully and I go, man, I hope he doesn't
have too many of my shows on the thing
[SPEAKER_06]: because I steal pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, wonderful sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a terrific group.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to just put a special plug in for
the lodges.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a neat thing to have in your
community and it's really terrific.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've put this up for a couple
nights and really fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyway, so let's start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I should probably go, well,
we'll just do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I got to thank Shango of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a guy who does an awful lot for
the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does a lot for the community here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He does a lot for the community all over
the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's really...
[SPEAKER_06]: Kino, which is the program I use,
just came out with that new thing so you
[SPEAKER_06]: can move stuff around.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the only one I could do it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm going to call this talk,
there's a new bud in town, Auto Flowering
[SPEAKER_06]: Canvas.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the wrong group to give this talk
to for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, this is the first time I've ever
given it, except for my wife who's sitting
[SPEAKER_06]: over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she really deserves more than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the second reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys know more about this than I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have these three books out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question I wrote these three
books.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a trilogy as was noted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I call myself Lord of the Roots
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, I used to be a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was an assistant attorney general back
when they decided that cannabis should be
[SPEAKER_06]: legal in the privacy of your home in
Alaskan in 1975 and helped with the
[SPEAKER_06]: definition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I became a corporate type.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was actually president of a Fortune
500 unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crow, you can't imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I better just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I'm heavily retired.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one thing I still do before I go on to
the next stage, I have to say...
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the one thing I still do is I
write this garden column.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually, the newspaper has changed
its name back to what it was when I first
[SPEAKER_06]: wrote it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the Anchorage Daily News.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm writing this garden column every
single week for 40, I think it's now 44
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've never missed a week because they
put your picture in the paper and it says
[SPEAKER_06]: he's not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he'll be back in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that to me said, Rob, his house,
he's not home.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I still write what we think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, for years, even though we
had that wonderful opinion from the
[SPEAKER_06]: Supreme Court saying it was legal in the
privacy of your home, I would tell people,
[SPEAKER_06]: when I write about tomatoes, I'm really
writing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people, you know, wink,
wink.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then it became legal, legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we voted it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in 2016, I wrote the first garden
column, I think, in the United States of
[SPEAKER_06]: America about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I answered my question by,
of course, talking about quote,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am certain that there were a lot of
people at the newspaper readership who
[SPEAKER_06]: were incredibly upset that it was legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, things like this,
you know, from some of the readers,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: gardeners in America found out that I was
writing columns, occasionally,
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioning cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got an invitation to go down to
my group, this is a member of this group,
[SPEAKER_06]: and to give the very first talk they ever
had on anything having to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time ever they rejected books,
Jorge Cervantes' books.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would reject them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but all of a sudden they said,
okay, well, I don't know if I'll come in
[SPEAKER_06]: and give a talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I stole that little letter,
the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went to talk to the professional
garden readers of America, they do TV and
[SPEAKER_06]: radio, and webpages and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was going to show them why I thought
cannabis was going to be the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, it was a success.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was stunned at how ignorant they
were about all things having to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: this wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I explained to them,
listen, this is legal in so many states,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it will be legal in all of the states,
probably within the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there are all sorts of
opportunities for garden writers to write
[SPEAKER_06]: about this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the hottest topic out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I stole an explosion.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and they have phenomenal
landscape plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They cover up ugly, and they even have
full color, for God's sake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was really enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grow like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They look like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the number one growing
plant in the United States of America,
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you take any survey,
every gardener grows tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are a lot of different
choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at how easy they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really like them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's constant improvement and research
being done on them, and opportunity for
[SPEAKER_06]: big harvests if you want them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and the scent of the plant
evokes these wonderful memories.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't remember working with your
father or your mother or your grandparents
[SPEAKER_06]: or somebody, you know, growing tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that's what it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It evokes memories.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you brush against a tomato plant,
you think about these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and by the way, it's got a trichome on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one's the cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, then I had to talk to them a little
bit about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why was cannabis the best, you know,
the next tomato?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, so many choices, unbelievable
numbers of choices, and getting more all
[SPEAKER_06]: the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows extremely easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed, banana, black.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoyable fruits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Constant improvement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And research.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_06]: Opportunities for big harvests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily a big harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the scent evokes memories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them necessarily that good,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I am a father, I can tell you,
my father could smell cannabis two states
[SPEAKER_06]: in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time I smell cannabis,
I think of him just for a nanosecond,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I don't panic anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so the rest of the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I gave this talk and everything else,
you know, but there was just something
[SPEAKER_06]: holding back the enthusiasm of the crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something holds back cannabis from being
the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, part of it is the illegality
situation, although I think that's going
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's going away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the number one reason is, geez,
these plants can't take.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really big, and most people don't
have big gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's Jorge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just don't have big gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the indica, which is the smaller
version, they're too big for a garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're not going to really grow
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, unless you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, there's that photo
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you live in a place like
Anchorage, Alaska, you understand photo
[SPEAKER_06]: period like no one's business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so cannabis has a real problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You start it, and then you grow it,
and you grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't set flowers until you get 12
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got to grow it, you know,
maybe a couple of, you know, there it is
[SPEAKER_06]: right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got to grow it a couple of
more months, maybe even more months,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's got a lot of that Afghani,
you know, history in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, you can grow it all the way
into the next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the flowers still aren't ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you got to grow it indoors if
you live in an area where you don't get 12
[SPEAKER_06]: hours of darkness before the frost comes,
like Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like most places where smart
people live.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so you have probably got to
grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, you know, problems that do not
themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: All sorts of, just a big peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you have one of these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, light and depth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that cool?
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at it in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunrise, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunrise, sunrise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cue the sunrise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cue the sunrise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want one of these in the worst way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Worse, I want the franchise for this in
Anchorage, Alaska in the worst way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, unless you have one of those,
you know, cannabis is not the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you live in the equator, you live
someplace really warm like Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay, you know, maybe Bastion
Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is the next tomato man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the reaction I got from them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of them were really shocked that
I would even suggest this, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait a minute, I say to myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another type of cannabis which
makes cannabis the next garden tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so we got sativa and indica,
which everybody knows about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we got the rudialis, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which a lot of people, I'm surprised a lot
of people don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm dumbfounded how many commercial
growers have no idea that there's such a
[SPEAKER_06]: thing as an auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cannabis rudialis was discovered in
1924.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it was reported discovered in
1924.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a Russian guy, he was studying around
the Volga River and he discovered this
[SPEAKER_06]: little seeded plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whoa, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we argue about whether
there are three varieties and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing about this plant was he
found it, grown it in some crappy soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when he tried to smoke it,
it was lousy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he smoked it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it didn't have any THC in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, it sort of fell by the
wayside.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the three species.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the sizes of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1924.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's always described as being a
big fat leaf plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in fact, every time you see a picture
of it, they've got these little skinny
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really kind of a cool looking plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the deal about this stuff is that it's
fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason it grows fast is because it
started growing in places where the winter
[SPEAKER_06]: came quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it didn't grow fast and get the
flowering stage and seed stage,
[SPEAKER_06]: it didn't survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the only ones that survived were
the ones that lived through the evolution,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_06]: This stuff blooms based upon genes,
not based upon photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crow!
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is kind of revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people got kind of excited about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do they come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, these come from plantations,
hemp plantations from around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've now discovered cannabis rudialis
in places like Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any place where there was a hemp farm,
there would be escape plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, this is why people grow
hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the fiber.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the fiber is made into
cloth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was absolutely key for sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was absolutely key for rope,
for sailing, so that we could go conquer
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was very, very important stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love this story.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've discovered that if you take three
cannabis ropes and 18 people, you can move
[SPEAKER_06]: these things all over the island.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically what they did.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we all know that George
Washington, he didn't grow a hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: His slaves grew the hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he paid his taxes with hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was a wrassly guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only did he grow cannabis,
this is one of the places he surveyed in
[SPEAKER_06]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a natural bridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look very closely around that
bridge, you see that George Washington
[SPEAKER_06]: inscribed his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a profiteer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lincoln has said it was a small camp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really track that down,
but I believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a hemp plantation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two plants got out, and they just did
their thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if this was in Siberia, then the
winter came really quickly, blah,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you got that great evolutionary
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got this rudialis plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, very low quality,
which should indicate to most of us,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's got low quality, it ain't going to
be around very long, because who wants a
[SPEAKER_06]: low quality plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very weak, very weak of any THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the professional growers, when they
heard about it, when somebody started to
[SPEAKER_06]: go out to pick them in Canada and other
places, these rudialis plants and try to
[SPEAKER_06]: do stuff with them, they laughed at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this was just sort of a junk weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until some of the really smart geneticists
of the age got together and had a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of discussions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they figured out, do something with
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they studied up and crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing what a weeder can teach
another weeder, particularly if you have
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely no education, but you have a
desire and a need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, the breeding was done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And interesting things happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I got my timing right on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hold me to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Sensei Seeds came out with
something called rudialis skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what this was, was a really easy
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It still had the regular cannabis auto
flowering, photo period situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was an interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went to flower very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what they were working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to get at the flower quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget the photo period stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it wasn't very good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people sort of lost interest until
this guy came along.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember his name, but it will
come to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he bred one of these rudialis that was
given to him by a guy named Antonio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently it was from Mexico,
the story goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he bred it with Williams Wonder,
which as you can see, from the wonderful
[SPEAKER_06]: Gen X, unknown, unknown, unknown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's whoever Williams was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Northern Lights, number two,
which used Alaska quite a bit for
[SPEAKER_06]: municipal purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And came out with a plant he called the
lowrider.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lowrider was cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took nine generations to breed him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what one of the first ones
looked like.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a cute little teeny plant with a
little butt on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these were really incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they grew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their seeds were good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could sell this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, this was really something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people started to slowly begin to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was small.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of them, depending on how you
grew, really, really small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: The kind of thing you would take out at a
dinner party.
[SPEAKER_06]: And carry it around in your pocket or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the horror was standing in
the way.
Don't lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my first ever story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, the big guy still continued to
laugh.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't get too close to that kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got claws.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure, they were weak.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they said, look.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you started out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you started out as.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the big guys on the regular boards
were laughing their heads off about these
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anybody who wrote about auto flowers
on Grass City and those places,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of us, it was like before all of the
stuff that goes on in the internet now,
[SPEAKER_06]: where people attack everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would just attack these auto flower
people for just growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And six months later, because remember,
these things grow from seed to harvest in
[SPEAKER_06]: as little as seven to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can imagine there was a little bit
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in six months, you start getting
things like this on the boards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good few ounces from this baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like 400.
[SPEAKER_06]: Power to match.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there started to be their own
form.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Auto Flowering Network formed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Auto Flowering Network is the place to
go if you are going to get information
[SPEAKER_06]: about auto flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_06]: The growers on Auto Flowering Network know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I wrote the book, started to write
the book, I get on Auto Flowering Network.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I join.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hop on.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first little post is I'm writing a
book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez, I'm looking for some pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody want to sell a book?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to sell some pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is Thursday the 4th.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you're right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things have really, really changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to call these professionals
who don't think that auto flowers are any
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, where's the beef, folks?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you where the beef is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow these plants, big ones,
little ones, Christmas tree style.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can branch them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I know some of you are sitting here
and you're a skeptic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to show you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a test.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holden Pro THCA 28.63.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too strong for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got everything you'd ever want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go look up Mephisto on Instagram and take
a look at some of the pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now from those little teeny guys to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my wife wonders why are you so excited
about auto flowering cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're every bit as good,
as far as I'm concerned, as the big guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get incredible product from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from a medicinal perspective,
you get the ability to be able to play
[SPEAKER_06]: around with these things like crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: 88.4.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from a company, Territorial Seeds,
which is in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you know them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Territorial Seeds has a sister company
called New Breed Seeds, and that's one of
[SPEAKER_06]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they sell to us anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they sell to commercial growers,
which is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: These things really started to become
commercial around 2012, 2013, somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: around there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were really the first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That low-rider was 2002 or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can get seeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, left anybody out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get seeds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I understand you can't buy seeds
at a dispensary store here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw them.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we have to change about
what I was talking about with David around
[SPEAKER_06]: here someplace, we've got to change some
of these laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we can ship hemp seeds,
there's no THC in the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we ought to be able to change some
state programs, which we will.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the equipment is now available.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get the seeds on the internet,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you can get seeds where they
are legally sold, which is in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_06]: other states.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can get seeds from friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can get seeds here legally.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get all the equipment you need
from a Flows or Two Valley or an Ace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything you possibly need.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to be devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to insist that
auto-flowering cannabis, it is the next to
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the book I wrote isn't a book for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a book for my mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm convinced this is a plant that
she would grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out October 27th,
which is unbelievable, because I just
[SPEAKER_06]: wrote it six months ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, these are spectacular plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at what we're going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just the cute little things.
[SPEAKER_06]: They look just like tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They take the place of the tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to remember, you've got to
limit in some states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got to be careful if you're in
Alaska and you have a swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only want to put six around your
swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not eight, because that would be against
the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these we're going to have to
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once everybody gets over being excited
about all those new tax revenue,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to have to explain to them,
it's just a darn plant, for goodness
[SPEAKER_06]: sakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll grow as many as we want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it used to be that they thought
tomatoes were poisonous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had a big Supreme Court case in
the 1800s in New York State.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or on the steps into tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to convince these
people we're not dealing with poison here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the basic thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: These water flowering cannabis is
impacting the system exactly like the
[SPEAKER_06]: regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, just like tomatoes,
with a couple of differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have to learn how to
tell the difference between flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to have to teach the mothers
of the world or grandmothers of the world
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're male and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not very hard for people to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_06]: When in doubt, when you're growing one of
these things, just think of it as a
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know most of my books contain all
this scientific googly-glock and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything else about organic gardening,
the soil food, and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the butt of a cannabis plant,
which is pretty incredible, taken with the
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of cameras that take a lot of those
micro pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as I'm concerned, the takeaway
is just simply grow organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing something that you're
putting into your body, I don't care
[SPEAKER_06]: whether you're smoking it or eating it or
using a suppository, it doesn't make a big
[SPEAKER_06]: difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're putting it in your body.
[SPEAKER_06]: It ought to be organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's not organic, shame on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they grow just like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can buy seed just like you can buy
tomato seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you should look for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the same kinds of things that you
look for on a tomato packet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the back should have all the
information that you need in order to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: dummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just look at it and say,
oh, just stick this in the ground half an
[SPEAKER_06]: inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to germinate next amount of
days.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that information needs to be on the
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we're going to help make
cannabis less stigmatized by getting
[SPEAKER_06]: regular gardeners to use this plant,
auto flowery cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way we're going to get them to do
it is we're going to make this plant like
[SPEAKER_06]: any other plant they buy when they go into
a store, a greenhouse, or a nursery.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two kinds that have not been
developed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's really only one kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're called a second kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we want to call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're much bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: They usually take a little bit longer so
the average life span for them is a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're equally fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still auto flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have all the attributes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, that's what the commercial
growers are tending to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some of the seed packets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, the seed packets,
not all of those over there, because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think some of those are samples,
now have information on it that people
[SPEAKER_06]: would want to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you grow it in the same kind of soils
that you grow a tomato in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the growing medium, as far as I'm
concerned, should just be regular,
[SPEAKER_06]: great soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not spectacular soil, because these things
grow very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they react very quickly to fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you want to make sure that they're
not being overfed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't want soils that are too
heavy, too rich, a little bit of corn or
[SPEAKER_06]: stuck in, compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're going to fertilize,
particularly when you start, I always
[SPEAKER_06]: suggest when people start, just grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow the damn plant once.
[SPEAKER_06]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fertilize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to fertilize,
put a little bit of soil in the pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the fertilizer down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then put the soil in so that the plant
gets about three or four or five weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: where its roots are growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll grow into the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it needs it, it'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't need it at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a pH of 6.2 to 6.5, which is the
same as regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: From a soil food web perspective,
I know Dr. Elaine in likes to suggest that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is a little bit more fondly
dominated than I like to suggest it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these particular plants, they grow so
quickly that I'm sure that they are
[SPEAKER_06]: bacterially dominated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to make sure that they're
bacterially dominated.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use green mulches.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use, you know, bacterially
dominated compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as nutrients are concerned,
again, there's a lot of discussion about
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want to use low numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be sort of an ideal 3-2-4.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first couple of times,
at least the first time you grow,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't need to use anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll realize that it really doesn't
need very much food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: My father grew tomatoes for 60,
70 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: His father grew tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sold 10,000 of them every spring from
his property.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never used fertilizer on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use good soil, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the same thing with these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need good soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't want to use killer,
killer soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to grow slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You definitely want to use the mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the mycorrhizal fungi that infects
all cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the only one really that
infects cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you want to look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are mycorrhizal endorsement
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, this is what you want to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the names that it used to go by.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we're doing DNA, this is the name
that it's definitely called.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're growing regular cannabis,
you want to use that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You roll the seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put some in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want this stuff to infect those
roots as soon as they come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they grow so quickly, they may not
have enough time to really, really defend
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Containers, well, containers are key.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to transplant the auto
farming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grow so quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to grow them in the container that
I'm leaving them in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow them in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of these are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those air pots seem to be really fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of ugly, but they're kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they root like crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you want to make sure that your roots
are in good shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa!
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I stole it from the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I apologize, but thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, you can't undo it,
but the tea will.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got to pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grow fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I don't like to repot
them is because they grow so fast that it
[SPEAKER_06]: takes a while for the plant to regenerate
and to come back up to life again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it can take up a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: A week on a plant that's a 70-day plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like an eighth of its life or a
tenth of its life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to make sure it's in the right
container.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to have good drainage,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want them too big because you're
watering the little seedling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't want to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the pot's too big, it screws up the
watering situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as lights are concerned,
this is an area of incredible debate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use the best lights you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on what your situation is,
it can be any one of a number of different
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a situation where you've got
a way of getting the heat out,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can use one kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't, you've got to use other
kinds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are all sorts of just lots of
debate about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you use what you use and the best you
can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love these plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: David's here, by the way, if anybody wants
to talk to him about plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you make a comparison.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you figure out what you want to use
and where you're going to grow it,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my big advice is you don't go to one
of these places.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go to one of these places to buy
them because you want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get the sales pitches.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to go to one of these places
to buy them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to a grocery, whether it's a
hydroponics store or a soil store or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you talk to the people about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you talk to people who walk in and are
buying stuff about what they use or what
[SPEAKER_06]: they have because we're going to have to
try to figure out what are the best kinds
[SPEAKER_06]: of lights for these sort of flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some work better than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love a reflector.
[SPEAKER_06]: I come to find out that if you use
aluminum foil, you can cause some little
[SPEAKER_06]: burns on your plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't use aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use the polymer.
[SPEAKER_06]: A grow tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spectacular invention.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of spectacular invention.
[SPEAKER_06]: And someone will grow four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone will grow six.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you can put as much stuff
in them as you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of debate about sizes, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want to have some kind of
reflective stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can even grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they look like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water just like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to overwater.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to underwater.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to remember humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you want to have a humidity that's
a little bit higher, maybe 60%,
[SPEAKER_06]: 70% humidity during the beginning grow
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as it gets into the flower,
you want to bring it down to maybe 40%
[SPEAKER_06]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not always the easiest thing to do,
but if you can pay attention to it,
[SPEAKER_06]: it makes sense to do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want great ventilation, because these
get the same diseases that a powdery will
[SPEAKER_06]: do, et cetera, et cetera, as the other
plants, the bigger cousins.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to put your detection to find out
what you've got down in the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't put it up in the ceiling like a lot
of people do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to see what's there with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if something goes wrong with your
plants, just look up what's wrong with a
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I'm going to tell people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go out and buy a cannabis book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look up in your tomato book what's wrong
with your tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I should tell people that by looking
at the color of a plant, you're only
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a generalized idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 100 different reasons why a
plant can have a yellow leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a starting point, so you want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, one of the cool things about
these plants is they grow so fast that
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got a bug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes along.
[SPEAKER_06]: It finds your plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It then blows the whistle to get the
buddies to come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time the buddies come,
the plant's past the stage where the
[SPEAKER_06]: things can get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're really kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which way did they go?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a really neat temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to keep the temperature,
obviously, in the right zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not like tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they get too cool, they'll turn
purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they get too hot, they'll burn.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big difference from tomato plants,
which are 57 to 68 degrees is the ideal
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: For these auto flowers, 75 to 86 degrees
is the ideal temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have different trichomes,
but they definitely have trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have different kinds of flowers,
which again, people are going to have to
[SPEAKER_06]: learn how to tell the difference between a
male flower and a female flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is not that hard to do, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're going to have to learn
how to tell when these things are ripe,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's not like a tomato where you
just look at the color.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look at it, and you have to
figure out when it's going to be ripe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you make a good decision,
and you want to make sure you've got
[SPEAKER_06]: enough of these brown, and all these clear
ones are going to become cloudy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you're in the right zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a little bit of discussion
on that in the book, how you people
[SPEAKER_06]: already know about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you've got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an opportunity here, because most
of the cannabis which we buy commercially
[SPEAKER_06]: is dry, but it's very, very pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: This stuff really cures nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can dry it using any of the
methods I love the paper bag method.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then nice curing session, which is not
something that's done with regular
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the taste is phenomenal, absolutely
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do sort of these same things with
tomatoes as well, so it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: that foreign for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We turn them into different kind of
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Training, again, another big debate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people train.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a big debate, because these
plants grow very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they really don't need to be
trained.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes training does increase the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on the kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low stress training, just like a screen
agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low stress is easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get some incredible results.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a one-pointed, and now look at
the different ones we've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can definitely see that training
does help if you do it at the right time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a scrub right over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pull them down to the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can train them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or just tuck the leafs underneath and keep
them out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a great light and you want
to keep them in the leaves as much as you
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly can, you can do high stress
training, which is basically pinching,
[SPEAKER_06]: which we all know how to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to do it at the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's other high stress training.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I promise you, I promise you,
hang on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as I would go with the
politics, yeah, you know, there is this
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And pinching, you know, after I worked
with nutrients, pinching the plants just
[SPEAKER_06]: seems so cruel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK, anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get warmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get more buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything I read seems to say,
though, lost time never gained.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be really careful when
you're treating these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why the low stress works better
than the high stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really don't need any advice on high
stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, sometimes you want a Christmas
tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you want a plant that branches
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know what kind of plant it is,
then you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things go better with Coke and also Pepsi,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, you would not know that
those were not regular candlestick plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just tie it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's throw one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get a seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this particular seed, I believe,
was called a Walter White.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was attracted to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not have actual money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did not take these pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is 12 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look very carefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: 23 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would call your wife and tell her,
so what?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, 28 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definite flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: 33 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: 39 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 44, 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, what year are you here?
[SPEAKER_06]: 60.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: 65 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: 78.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're ready to pick you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give it five more days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, five more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine what that smelled like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Walter White.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: These trichomes are incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be very careful with your
handling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of these plants, autoflowers also,
you break those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they degrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here are the new breed seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of boring you with 20 pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed to harvest in 90 days and one slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So July 2nd, July 9.
[SPEAKER_06]: August 2nd, August 9.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two weeks after harvesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here are my predictions about
autoflowers and candlesticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is more and more commercial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Commercial growers are going to use them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's another thing about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a regular grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in a vegetative state or you're in
a flower state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't make a bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: In your spare little areas, you grow the
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had eight weeks of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get flowers and vegetation on two
different kinds of plants.
Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to destigmatize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have a stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you have the word marijuana in your
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's OK for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the general public, we've got to stop
using that word, pejorative.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got to take the stigma away
everywhere we can and that's the only way
[SPEAKER_06]: we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to start seeing autoflower
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk to gardeners about it
like you cannot believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send them copies of my books.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give those books away.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get people to plant
autoflower cannabis like you can't believe
[SPEAKER_06]: because it is the next thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to go into a Lowe's and out
to their plant lot and you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: find autoflower cannabis plants right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to go to your garden club and
they're going to be selling autoflower
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Alaska botanical garden wants to have
a class.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only thing that I said to them
was, good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got a big place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, we didn't think
about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to go to your soup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to find them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying you're going to be amazed
by it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see holiday plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see these plants all over
the place with temporary landscaping.
[SPEAKER_06]: When there's an event like this,
they're going to put them around the room
[SPEAKER_06]: and make it look pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll walk through the hotel lobby
and there'll be different kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: autoflowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go through the next week and it'll
be a different color autoflowering plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there'll be landscaped all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll walk into your friends and you go,
oh, nice picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll put them on your decks like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll go out with your tomatoes and
you'll grow them indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my favorite picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we make our own kombucha,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then eventually we'll be planting them
out in our garden like everybody else,
[SPEAKER_06]: like me, like in Alaska, Kenai,
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll enter them into the state fair
and then, just like this couple did last
[SPEAKER_06]: year in the Kenai State Fair in Alaska,
the stigma is going away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when these people find out this spring
about autoflowering cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Anchorage Daily News garden column,
you're going to have a whole category of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis at the state fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be phenomenal, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What a terrific plant to breed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have people breeding these
plants just like home gardeners breed
[SPEAKER_06]: their own heritage tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: And more important, if you're sick,
you're going to be able to make your own
[SPEAKER_06]: medicines, work them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to be sold to you and
you're going to be able to grow them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to be able to go back to
those land races and breed those land
[SPEAKER_06]: races in.
[SPEAKER_06]: These plants go from seed to flower in
seven to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be able to do so much
breeding research and back breeding like
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to end up with plants,
better plants than we ever had before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have tiny little plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to breed them with the
bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have autoflowering sativas
and autoflowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And gorgeous different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is in that lot of autoflower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw this at the Emerald Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the different nodes in this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a plant that a guy found in
Australia from an Aboriginal guy who was
[SPEAKER_06]: growing it for 60 or 70 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to start breeding that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to convince him, please do it
with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: My god, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to get just gorgeous,
beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to become a spectacular
house plant without question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maddacle, we've already talked about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my god, the idea of being able to
make your own and grow your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you've got crones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take that plant that's known good and
you bring it, and you end up in your own
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, we're going to be
doing research like crazy on these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to learn and teach the
regular gardener the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not indica gets you really tired and
sativa is a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's bullshit these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to teach people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to do a better job than the wine
industry did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a tan and taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know lemon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know lemon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be able to use these
autoflowers to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_06]: appreciate even regular weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the equipment's going to get
better and better and cheaper and more
[SPEAKER_06]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be terrific.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing is going to be the new blood in
town.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so I'm 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife hates me to say this, because she
thinks I'm a cop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember when organic food came.
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was in the food business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he came home one day and he said,
I'm really interested in this company I
[SPEAKER_06]: walked by when I go to a bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell a granola, Good Shepherd
granola.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first organic food company in
the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: The date?
[SPEAKER_06]: 1970.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in high school in 1970.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said organic food was coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were people who laughed their
heads off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my father.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it did come.
[SPEAKER_06]: And same thing is going to happen with
autoflowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said the same thing about the soil food
web and regenerative soil and all that
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wave is going to break on us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon already has a lot of fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't quite get it at Pike Street
Market.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you go down to Elliott Bay on
October 27, you'll find a book on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get one for your mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by all means, tomorrow, start some
autoflowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
All
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take a bunch of
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that this is a common question
that people ask me outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Jeff answer soil questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just asked him and he said yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got questions that are
burning in you from his three books,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can feel free to ask those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to start you off with an
awesome autoflowering question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they flower so swiftly, what size
pot do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two liters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two of the ubiquitous hardware store
buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So five gallon would be a nice default
setting for all of them because it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to outgrow them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who has some questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw on your map that you showed that
there was Rudorellis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It originated in Siberia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they found it in Siberia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had Siberia, but you also had Canada
all bleeped out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada is differently as Rudiella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is land race up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have it in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have it here for me in some place.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look very carefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Alaska, they claim that it came from a
Rudiella plant that somebody found while
[SPEAKER_06]: walking along the Alaska Railroad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only have one track.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can imagine how many people went up
and down the railroad track trying to find
[SPEAKER_06]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he found the one, and that's what we
got in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your process for seed starting to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use a paper plate method.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a wet towel on a paper plate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the seed down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put another towel on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a paper plate on top of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 hours later.
[SPEAKER_06]: These things are germinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: They germinate fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you pick it up carefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people say you pick it up by the
root area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask about the bacteria
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to get too deep, but have you had a
chance to throw a high-fungal dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: soil out of that auto?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try lots of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my big problems is that I'm never
home long enough to be able to feed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows so fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: The house sitter has to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the way in the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is auto flower, but you showed male
and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get feminized just like a
regular counseling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, most of the seeds you buy are
feminized.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although this is one of those areas where
you don't necessarily want a feminized
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may want to breed your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is the thing about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hobby plant now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put it in your tent with your
other plants, you're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get a crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a gambler's plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a gambler's plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep saying there is easy to grow
tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you kill all your tomato plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love tomatoes.
Buy them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people overwater their tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you stick the seed in the ground and
walk away from it and come back two months
[SPEAKER_06]: later, there should be tomatoes on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Theoretically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you noticed that you have different
germine or cannabinoid profiles with
[SPEAKER_06]: tomato plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they taste like regular wheat
and a bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, you know, I think a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem to have all the different,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last batch I grew, I got some seeds at
one of these conventions I went to.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't named or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they were a little susceptible
to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't grow that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, again, a neat thing about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at these plants and you say,
oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only six, seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to, this happened and that
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't make it after that,
forget it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go out and you move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do it indoors in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask him.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor, 99.5 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they'll do fine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the interesting things about
outdoor, too, when they're being,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can do two cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a bunch of us just pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: On April 1, we will harvest July 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will pop on July 1 and harvest on
October 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting two cycles with no light
depth, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could get one cycle every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoors and indoors, I get three cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting three cycles from
autoflowers outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in a little dome green room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are, they do fine outdoors
here for value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're short.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to grow them inside.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally, they were developed,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so people can grow them in a
little closet someplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom wouldn't know it was in your room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can squeeze them into the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can squeeze them into flower beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem is there's also someone
may come and steal it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: No question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a while, they weren't sure that they
were going to be able to get a consistent
[SPEAKER_06]: good CBD.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got everything you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just bred together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple as that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm that Russian guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's sitting there in 1924.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it about that plant that you were
talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say 60 years old?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was a plant that was brought back
from Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Australian Aboriginal had that plant
in his family for 60 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in case you're interested,
the person that's Caleb from CSI Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: who imported that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been a sponsor of Vimeo before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and he's got great pictures on his
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's called Australian
Bastard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's the nicest guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as the downside of
feminized seats?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they got there because they got
stressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they were stressed with gibberellic
acid or the colloidal silver, there could
[SPEAKER_06]: be some cellular or something to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the other hand, they can also be
stressed with light and the same thing
[SPEAKER_06]: happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Question, yes.
I have one on my garage.
You are short of one species.
Is there any information about having
multiple species in the Latin Hell campus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen any information.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all discussions I've had with
different people like Dr. M.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maranthus, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: That particular one I showed actually has
other stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three other ones in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I think they're in it
is because your cover crops might have a
[SPEAKER_06]: different mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are some people who say to
me, well, geez, since we know that the
[SPEAKER_06]: mycorrhizal is sort of a network of
conversation between plants, maybe putting
[SPEAKER_06]: in one that connects to a different plant
somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cover crop, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington State's one of the few states,
not the only, that is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't home grow without certain
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: One response to that is perhaps to get
people more familiar with the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: just start finding out what they're
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: These ones strike me as potentially having
some advantages there in that they could
[SPEAKER_04]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cycles are not as intrusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they might be able to reproduce and
start gaining mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my whole thought is that these
plants, first of all, I think they're as
[SPEAKER_06]: good as regular caters.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other thing is they're so easy to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so quick to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're so different than the other
kind of caters.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to get people, mothers of the
world, interested in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to say to their
legislators, what the hell are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sell plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, can you imagine somebody saying in
New England, go five tomato plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are commercial tomato
growers around the country who want to
[SPEAKER_06]: sell their critically high deployment
tomatoes to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we do this to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure that the stuff is
here to stay for good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll go in and clean up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what's going to have to
happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's enough of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it will happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Hawaii had a medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_06]: They changed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now a medical campus program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Citizens got up and said, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because same marijuana is like putting a
statue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since you're going to do that,
I think I will point out that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: called marijuana because we were before it
fell out of boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we already had the URL.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know you guys don't need to return.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, certainly not.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're a great audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: This group has a reputation around the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who spoke there last?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make an observation about
for anyone going indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go indoors personally in a tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I run 24-hour lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the benefits I enjoy there is I can
have a perpetual cycle where I can
[SPEAKER_02]: continually start a new plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my current plant goes in the flower,
I can start another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I'm shopping and harvesting,
my other plant's going in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting another one all under the
same lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally, what I run is 20 and 4.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you can go 24 hours lightening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unbelievable.
