[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff, a lot of people have respect for
vermicastings or worm castings or worm
[SPEAKER_01]: poop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most people, though, they see it
as a good organic nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from reading your books, I've realized
that that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that people
understand how worm castings can really
[SPEAKER_01]: help the soil food webs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you break that out for us?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all the books that people have
written about worms, they don't need
[SPEAKER_02]: another one from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there was a subject to write about,
worms and ants would be right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens with a worm is that they
take in their nutrient, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: just a bunch of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about that leaf they're
pulling into their body.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to take a couple of little
bacteria, maybe a little fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: some protozoa, yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest of it goes right through
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what comes out of the worm is that
organic material minus a few of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that the worm would ingest
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But an amazing thing happens inside the
worm that makes it more valuable than just
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's good nitrogen in worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is also somehow an increase in a
number of the elements that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have as nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So phosphorus, I've listed them in the
book, teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: About five or six of them are increased
five, six, seven, eight times in
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration as they come out the back
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what goes into the worm and what comes
out the back end are not the same in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of nutrient quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes out, it comes out in a
form that helps build soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so both the increase in nutrients and
that wonderful friable nature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: material itself, those castings,
they just make a terrific condominium for
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are full of nutrients, which the soil
food web needs and your plants need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still contain a tremendous number
of good microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for all of those reasons, worm casting
is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why so many people use worm
castings as opposed to just pure compost
[SPEAKER_02]: or vermicastings is because of this
increased concentration in these five or
[SPEAKER_02]: six or seven nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that you said that it creates a
good condominium for the food web because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to live there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a good living environment.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said that it adds to soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you break out what exactly you mean by
soil structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at soil, depending on where
you are, it has a different feel,
[SPEAKER_02]: a different crumbleness, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are soil structures,
how the soil is put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the soil food web world,
what happens is the bacteria, they give
[SPEAKER_02]: off a glue in order to be able to stick
themselves together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sticks to little pieces of metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, it could stick to those
little teeny castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those castings stick to each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that begins to form a conglomerate of
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get pore spaces where air and
water can go and little guys can hide from
[SPEAKER_02]: the big guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fungi come in and they weave
around those little conglomerates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, and then even if you
have the worm in there, it goes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a tunnel and a burrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this stuff makes it easier for a
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots can grow between and around
these pore spaces and into these pore
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there happen to be worms in the soil,
they can go right in the worm hole tunnels
[SPEAKER_02]: and burrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having worms is really a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time of year, a lot of us are
looking to source worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have our own worm boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can buy castings from a local farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also most of us will end up going to a
grow shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got bags that are pure worm
castings, which are much more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we've got these worm castings and
some kind of soil mix bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always have a hard time deciding
which one to buy because I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper price, but I don't particularly
like that I'm paying for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there might be a good reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were going to guide somebody to
one product or another, what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: we should look for when looking to buy
worm castings?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the pure worm castings myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never know what the soil is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course the label, if it's good
soil and I know what the people are,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have my own soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my own compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think you have to be very careful
that when you buy worms yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you make sure you get the right kind
of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this worm they're bringing in from
Asia as a bait worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the regular red wiggler that
we all were taught to buy, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the worm that is causing the duff
to disappear too quickly in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fishermen go fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't catch anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They throw the worms down on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: These worms eat all of the duff in six
months that should take two or three years
[SPEAKER_02]: to disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next thing you know,
you have garlic mustard move in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garlic mustard is, boy am I getting off
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garlic mustard is allopathic for the
mycorrhizal fungi that feed maple trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maple trees are dying all over as a
result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be careful about where
you're getting the worms as well as your
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take another step down that rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said the red wigglers that we were
all taught to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the recent feedback I've been getting
from people, they've been recommending me
[SPEAKER_01]: picking up night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which are the right worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The night crawlers, they're deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have them in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a lot of experience with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know people that have brought them
into Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm beginning to wonder, is that a
good thing, first of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the worms basically in the United
States have been imported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, like all the worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the ones in the soil or just the
ones that we're selling?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the ones in the soil came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had worms in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glaciation came and it destroyed the
worms, except a few of them down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some what they call pot worms that
survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: But earthworms didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the pilgrims came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had worms in the ballast of their
boats.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took those rocks, they put them
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had worms in, you know, and then
Johnny Appleseed and Oregon Tram,
[SPEAKER_02]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about 20, 25 years ago, I started
getting phone calls from people in
[SPEAKER_02]: Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, what are these little bumps in my
lawn?
[SPEAKER_02]: People had never seen a worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had the biggest compost pile in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And worms, I mean, that's what you fished
with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But worm castings are very valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go for the pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is soil structure,
but also because it's got a high
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
