build a social media following today he's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to share that insight with us please
welcome Brian Waxman
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up Denver I've been away for a
while so it feels good to come back I've
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gone through some things on
Instagram with using some marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and stuff so I hope to give you
guys an insider look on what it really
[SPEAKER_01]: takes to build your Instagram organically
so it kind of ties into the way that I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to grow cannabis and the same way
that I like to grow my Instagram account
[SPEAKER_01]: so for 2020 I really hope that you guys
start to see that social media is keen and
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you guys aren't on at least
Instagram especially for your larger
[SPEAKER_01]: brands you're really missing out so I hope
to kind of educate you guys and enlighten
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys so that at least you'll start
that Instagram and it is a daily thing
[SPEAKER_01]: all right so who remembers the grassroots
days anybody in here all right so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of where I started I started learning
about content creation that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and because it was all cannabis related it
was pretty easy to gain followers so I
[SPEAKER_01]: just worked on making sure that my content
kept improving so the first viral photo
[SPEAKER_01]: that I ever had was this photo right here
I was done in my basement and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing with the cover crop
improving clones you see a little one here
[SPEAKER_01]: and then as that one started to grow I
would add the cover crop a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: back then weren't really showing that so
that's how I was able to start building a
[SPEAKER_01]: profile on mass roots if you guys remember
like Wiz Khalifa little Wayne if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: went to that show this was my first mass
roots photo that actually was featured so
[SPEAKER_01]: when on the platform there that meant that
pretty much every single person would be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to see your photo so in hindsight
that kind of like gave me that injection
[SPEAKER_01]: of social media where it felt good to open
up that platform and see you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand people liking your stuff so
unfortunately mass roots ended up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down I believe they went bankrupt and
reported losses of 44 million dollars so
[SPEAKER_01]: to run these social media things is huge
one thing that I did learn with the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: roots platform is that basically I am
building my house the same as you guys on
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else's land so remember that if
the littlest thing happens all that work I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I spent unfortunately I couldn't get
to my master's account but it had over
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 followers and that took me about
two years to build so that was really two
[SPEAKER_01]: years wasted for me the next one that I
learned about was content creation again
[SPEAKER_01]: so I started teaching myself about Canva I
was showing out of living so I could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: roots a lot easier than synthetic salts
and this was my first viral content on
[SPEAKER_01]: that platform unfortunately like I said
mass roots got shut down so the next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to move my attention was the doobie
platform any of you guys were on the
[SPEAKER_01]: doobie platform as well yeah not many
people are on that one so I worked really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to do the same thing content creation
kind of the same stuff came same game plan
[SPEAKER_01]: basically and I was able to build the
largest following on that app over 49,000
[SPEAKER_01]: followers again unfortunately doobie
didn't really understand the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry market so they were kind of just
showing girls and bikinis and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and there wasn't really any real
breeders any real growers on the platform
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the interest started to die down I
think they yeah and they lost their
[SPEAKER_01]: following late August 2018 so just pretty
recently the doobie start to fall off as
[SPEAKER_01]: well all right so so then I actually
worked with this man right here I'm having
[SPEAKER_01]: some other larger brands around the state
through mass roots and through doobie
[SPEAKER_01]: people started to see our content and
that's really when I wanted to start
[SPEAKER_01]: giving back so we created our first event
it was on September 11th we were trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a bunch of veterans to come out for
free we had the Looper bus and we all
[SPEAKER_01]: dabbed and back then especially it was
pretty nostalgia everyone kind of enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I was hoping to move forward with
growing on that doobie app unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: that didn't work out for me so I started
teaching myself Instagram so this was my
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram at the time I was doing
basically the same thing that I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: on mass roots and doobie unfortunately on
Instagram there's so many people on that
[SPEAKER_01]: platform that it's hard to compete so I
was working every day the same way on mass
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and doobie and I was only able to
build my following to about 2,000
[SPEAKER_01]: followers so I really started to focus on
what improves engagement so more showing
[SPEAKER_01]: more faces showing more of the guys that
I'm hanging out with showing more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: back end things that you would think are
pretty mundane at your grows or your
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries that's actually what people
like to see on social media especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Midwest back then people really like
to see us just messing with plants
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how to grow cannabis so I kept
the engagement basically with these two
[SPEAKER_01]: things making sure that I started to learn
about hashtags and then making sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: every post that I made had a geo tag so
that'd be like the same thing today if you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are taking photos making sure that
it's the Denver Mart or you can also look
[SPEAKER_01]: up where it says Indo Expo show and then
that will actually geo tag right here
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are so a lot more people will be
able to see your content just using more
[SPEAKER_01]: hashtags and just using geo tags from
there I really started to dive into what
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes to build an Instagram account and
really that comes back to the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're trying to build something like
a website you have to adhere by
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram's algorithm so what I would
basically do is I would I created my
[SPEAKER_01]: profile right 303 organic cannabis that is
basically like your email if you will you
[SPEAKER_01]: do never you never really want to change
that because all those likes all those
[SPEAKER_01]: tags that people have as soon as you
change that name all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: disappears so it's kind of like a musician
or something like that when you're on that
[SPEAKER_01]: platform you never want to change that you
are able to change this this is more for
[SPEAKER_01]: SEO so I like to use emojis because most
people when they look at your profile
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not really gonna read everything
they're gonna scan so this sticks out when
[SPEAKER_01]: I like somebody's photo you'll actually
see my name and then living soil cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath that with a little brain so if
you guys have business accounts on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram this is this is worth gold right
here this is how people find you so you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have something on there not your
name like reality most people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: me as Brian most people know me as 303
organic cannabis so it's kind of pointless
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to put my name right here because
nobody's going to be looking for that but
[SPEAKER_01]: they are looking for living soil cannabis
then I would once you sign up for a
[SPEAKER_01]: business account you're able to use
hashtags in real time so this was who I
[SPEAKER_01]: was working for back in the day and so I
would just kind of show people that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: using my Instagram to educate I was using
I was a living soil instructor at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was working at Buffalo I was also
growing from green farms I was also the
[SPEAKER_01]: communications director for a Denver
Normal and then I was also cross promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: back then on the Dubia then you would use
your the URL that you want to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: promote and back then I had only spoken at
Canada grow expo so I'm proud to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my fourth time speaking at Indo
expo and I can attribute most of this just
[SPEAKER_01]: from this Instagram account so you really
can build brands just on Instagram I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to show that was the first time we
got a hundred likes so I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys have ever got that real quick but
it's a weird feeling I feel like it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of kind of keeps you going forward when
you start to realize that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to pay attention to the content
that you're producing does anybody see
[SPEAKER_01]: anything pretty weird or nostalgia wise on
this infographic right newspapers I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure most of you guys in here I'm a
small-time guy I can't compete with a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand that's been in 719 total dollars on
that but the one thing that you will not
[SPEAKER_01]: see yet is there's nothing being spent on
social media at least on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook you're not even allowed to so
that allows us the small-time guys to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to compete with these bigger brands
by just putting in the work on these
[SPEAKER_01]: social media platforms I would imagine as
we go nationwide for legalization that
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram Facebook will begin to allow you
guys to spend money and promote your post
[SPEAKER_01]: but at this time you're not allowed to so
that gives us that even playing field
[SPEAKER_01]: right now for the small-time guy Instagram
and Facebook although Facebook owns
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram they're vastly different
platforms so what would work on Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: is not going to work on Instagram and in
my opinion for cannabis Facebook is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to die off there's about you know
there's about 1 billion people actually
[SPEAKER_01]: actively every month on Instagram and
that's obviously a huge place to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: build your profiles start to get the word
out Instagram whose growth is going at
[SPEAKER_01]: five percent per quarter and then Facebook
is only at three snapchat at two so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see that this is where the growth is
going what if you're gonna spend your time
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know a lot of you guys are probably
also farmers we don't have a lot of time I
[SPEAKER_01]: start to just focus on that one platform
and for me everything has come from
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram even though I have been on mass
routes and I have been on Duby the only
[SPEAKER_01]: time I've actually made monetary gains in
my life is from Instagram so the platform
[SPEAKER_01]: data is really starting to come through if
you're posting things on Facebook and
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram you're gonna see 23 percent less
engagement on Facebook than you would with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same photo on Instagram there's brands
that are on Facebook that are promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've seen ten times less engagement
on that platform compared to Instagram so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just me saying this the data is
also starting to show that the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: people are starting to move towards
Instagram and then of course that
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement on platform is point oh nine
percent on Twitter point four oh I'm sorry
[SPEAKER_01]: point oh four eight percent and then this
is actually pretty impressive for the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire platform one point six percent
engagement I don't know if you guys really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand those numbers but that is huge
for a app that means there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people of that billion people they're
checking in every day looking at their
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram feed and that's what we want we
want eyeballs on our content so Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: was bought by Facebook April 9th 2012 for
a billion dollars and they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: reached that billion monthly subscribe our
users on June 20th 2018 so it really
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been that many years until
everybody started a flocking towards
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram Instagram made six point one
eight billion dollars in 2018 they made
[SPEAKER_01]: nine point oh eight billion dollars in
2019 and they're projected to make twelve
[SPEAKER_01]: point three two billion dollars in 2020 so
you can tell that with that amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: money that they're starting to make that
you continue to improve the platform and
[SPEAKER_01]: where big money is that's how you know
that they're not going to fall to the
[SPEAKER_01]: wayside like some of these other apps that
I've been talking about here who here
[SPEAKER_01]: understands influencer marketing right so
basically what that is is somebody has a
[SPEAKER_01]: large profile usually those are like
Instagram models and they take a photo of
[SPEAKER_01]: a product snap it and then this company
would pay them for doing that when a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of those influence influential marketing
campaigns were asked which platforms you
[SPEAKER_01]: like to use 79 or 73 79 percent of the
people chose Instagram so I don't I really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to keep harping on this but the
data and everything is showing that the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire movement is moving away from
anything really but Instagram maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of tick-tock as well so these
are brands that were actually built on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram platform solely on influencer
marketing and I would imagine most ladies
[SPEAKER_01]: know this brand you guys ladies have heard
this and then if you're a workout guy
[SPEAKER_01]: workout lady bang energy drinks so if
you'll notice they kind of do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: setup all big brands will use emojis and
then they're trying to get you to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: something on their Europe URL no matter
what brands you are whether you're got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred million followers or you have a
thousand followers you get one link so the
[SPEAKER_01]: goal is to try to get people to start to
learn more about you using that URL
[SPEAKER_01]: fashion Nova chooses this post probably
five six times a day really getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: content out there where bank energy
probably posts just a few times so you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys can see that you know you start
posting more times per day if you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that the more following that you're
going to start to achieve so last year 95
[SPEAKER_01]: million photos were shared per day on
Instagram 1 billion of those people were
[SPEAKER_01]: on the platform every single day 500
million stories are being shared every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day 63 percent of Instagram users
log on at least once a day and this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: metric that everyone should care about
most people are on the entire platform are
[SPEAKER_01]: on there for at least 28 minutes a day
this is huge compared to any other
[SPEAKER_01]: platform so that's why again I keep my
focus on Instagram so Instagram's goal is
[SPEAKER_01]: really to keep you addicted to their
platform they want that 28 minutes to go
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 32 then to 36 as time goes on one of
the easiest ways for them to do that is to
[SPEAKER_01]: create certain things like this Instagram
stories is basically like snapchat so they
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to improve their platform to
steal a lot of that traffic that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on to the other platforms and I imagine in
2020 Instagram is going to continue to do
[SPEAKER_01]: these things the problem is is that
cannabis is really not allowed on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram so even if you are creating
fantastic content none of our stuff as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as late 2019 and now in 2020 goes on the
Explorer page and that's really how you
[SPEAKER_01]: build your account on Instagram so we have
to think through these things to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: find ways for us to work together to try
to help promote each other's stuff so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we tag each other in the
stories hopefully you can start tagging
[SPEAKER_01]: more of your friends in the actual daily
posts because none of our stuff is hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: that Explorer page and this is carousel
was created last year and this goal is for
[SPEAKER_01]: every single one your posts instead of
them when you're going through your feed
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that one photo now that carousel
the goal is to keep more people on the
[SPEAKER_01]: platform so you're able to post up to 10
photos on that carousel and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: where I feel like the next the next
breakthrough is for us as canvas farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: to start to show as many photos as we can
to try to continue to build that
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement with all of the negative things
that are happening with Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook has anybody had their account
deleted on Facebook or Instagram yeah so
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys know how disheartening that is my
account is taking me over three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years to build so they deleted that
tomorrow to be honest I don't know where
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be because Instagram really is
building up everything that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: business-wise branding wise so it's really
it's really important to stay focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that you guys understand how
the algorithm works and that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to teach you guys today so the youth
is basically the ones that are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: platform itself these numbers I've
actually started to climb late in 2019 so
[SPEAKER_01]: as you guys can see this stuff isn't going
away it's only being consumed more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more does anybody know what this is
everybody knows who Kylie Jenner is I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure right so then I would say the
majority of the internet really doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Kardashians so somebody came up
with a way to beat her top photo that was
[SPEAKER_01]: done in 2018 of her daughter Stormi so
they just posted an egg and said that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to break the world record please
like this egg and I like this slide
[SPEAKER_01]: because it kind of shows the power of
Instagram we're trying to do this on
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously a microcosm scale but if your
entire cannabis community gets behind you
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff can also kind of go viral like
this so as to date we're close to 53
[SPEAKER_01]: million likes just on an egg so I would
hope that you guys really start to see
[SPEAKER_01]: there really is power behind this once
those accounts start to grow and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: give a tip of the hat to a company called
seven ten labs here in Denver those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: really understand social media and their
stuff is still trying to go there a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff still goes viral and that's
because they have such a strong following
[SPEAKER_01]: and you really have to admire that in this
day and age to try to build that stuff up
[SPEAKER_01]: they have quality products I have nothing
to do with 710 labs but I just admire
[SPEAKER_01]: their work everything that they're doing
from product creation to social media to
[SPEAKER_01]: being around the community is the reason
why they're able to combat some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: negative things that have been happening
to a lot of these cannabis accounts so
[SPEAKER_01]: last year I was approached by a marketing
company that told me that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: improve my Instagram account and I sat
down in a meeting with a few of their few
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people in that marketing firm they
talked about follow for follow and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these kind of like silly things that don't
even really work anymore unfortunately for
[SPEAKER_01]: me I started to find out today I actually
knew more about Instagram in this
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing company but I asked them please
do not add fake followers please I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need fake likes that kind of stuff and
they assured me that that wasn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen unfortunately for me that's exactly
what did happen I almost lost my Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: account last year so I feel for a few of
those people that raised their hand before
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a nightmare for a cannabis
Instagram account so basically what had
[SPEAKER_01]: happened was I gave my password and my
username to that marketing firm they then
[SPEAKER_01]: outsourced that to a third party and all
around the world people started to log
[SPEAKER_01]: into my Instagram account which means I
don't know how you guys feel but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like like maybe not as extreme to a
bank account but it's pretty close
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you've worked that hard to
try to build that Instagram up so now
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has my banking information for
Instagram and again a lot of this stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: took these three but there was a lot more
login not only attempts but actual logins
[SPEAKER_01]: that were people were successful so if
somebody was malicious they could have
[SPEAKER_01]: deleted my entire account and I have no
control over that whatsoever I hate this
[SPEAKER_01]: slide okay so this is basically what they
started to do they started spamming in my
[SPEAKER_01]: DMs which by the way Instagram watches
that stuff so back in the day I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: some of us used to hey man can I get a
couple pounds and then and the DMs that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff that all the Instagram
algorithm watches all that now so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those seed breeders out there that keep
getting their accounts deleted I can
[SPEAKER_01]: assure them it's because they're doing
business within that direct message so if
[SPEAKER_01]: they stop doing that a lot of their
accounts will stop being deleted so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are talking business that kind of
stuff within that direct message there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance that you are going to get deleted
and of course if you're spamming people
[SPEAKER_01]: which they are doing this to thousands of
people right so basically what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is hey my name is Brian I work with
living soil solutions I'd love to connect
[SPEAKER_01]: with you sometime thousands and thousands
and thousands of times every single week
[SPEAKER_01]: some people obviously get annoyed with
that so somebody hacked into my account
[SPEAKER_01]: and changed everything again this is a
nightmare situation for me I have no idea
[SPEAKER_01]: what language this is I had no idea what
they had done so it took me weeks to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get my Instagram account credentials
back which obviously slows down branding
[SPEAKER_01]: or all of those things and then the
dreaded dead followers ghost followers
[SPEAKER_01]: these are the kind of people that started
following me so my account jumped up right
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were I would go into those
meetings they say oh look look at how many
[SPEAKER_01]: followers you have now I'm not sure if you
guys understand how that the algorithm at
[SPEAKER_01]: least works now from 2019 and 2020 but
about seven to ten percent of your
[SPEAKER_01]: followers are going to see your content
when you first post and then those
[SPEAKER_01]: followers are going to dictate if they
like that stuff if they're engaging are
[SPEAKER_01]: they making comments are they sending it
to other people if that is happening then
[SPEAKER_01]: those photos go on to the next round of
your followers and your content can still
[SPEAKER_01]: grow sometimes virally that way but it's
all up to those followers so if I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of ghost followers when I'm posting
my posts are literally going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ether there's nobody seeing that content
so to cheat the system in 2019-2020 on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is foolish maybe when we like
2008-2009 when a lot of that automation
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff would work a lot of people would you
could kind of you could kind of tell back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day because there'd be 50,000
followers with 100 likes on a photo that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a fake right that's a fake account and in
my in my opinion that's basically like not
[SPEAKER_01]: having an account no one's going to engage
with that people think it's silly so I
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage you guys that if you do have a
bunch of ghost followers this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff where they don't even take the time
to post a photo you can go within your
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram account and start to remove
those people and then this is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram on the front porch me on their
lawn pumping that shotgun saying if you
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to do this we are going to delete
your account and this just happened to me
[SPEAKER_01]: just a few months ago so I I can't express
enough why this is so disheartening is
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have to work on my Instagram to
grow it the way that I have organically
[SPEAKER_01]: every single day so to have that deleted
would be heartbreaking let's see so
[SPEAKER_01]: basically once this once this comes out I
have probably about a week to two weeks to
[SPEAKER_01]: change things so I have to make sure that
any kind of program that I've ever logged
[SPEAKER_01]: in before any kind of third-party app that
is associated with my Instagram I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that I log out of that and
delete that from my actual phone itself or
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is going to continue to notice
that if I did nothing here they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: deleted my account and just recently this
is basically what is that not even
[SPEAKER_01]: basically almost a month ago I got this
message and this comes from still people
[SPEAKER_01]: that do follow me sometimes they'll go
through the feed and like a lot of photos
[SPEAKER_01]: real quickly Instagram sees that as a
automation technique and they actually
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down my account for a week every
single day I would tell them that this was
[SPEAKER_01]: a mistake and I still wasn't able to log
into my account all right so this is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bread and butter this is what I
want to teach you guys today this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to to build your organically build
your Instagram account I may not have that
[SPEAKER_01]: 22,000 followers that the marketing
company touted as a good thing but I do
[SPEAKER_01]: have real followers so when I first start
out again I make sure that this is up here
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the metric that most of you that
have a business account really should care
[SPEAKER_01]: about is that how many people are coming
to your profile every single week my goal
[SPEAKER_01]: with the amount of followers that I have
is to try to get that up to a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: every single week if you notice I have a
lower post profile so if there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that really didn't do well or maybe it's
an older post that had you know 34 likes
[SPEAKER_01]: two years ago I'll just delete that post
because everything comes down to this
[SPEAKER_01]: algorithm the more followers that I have
the better the algorithm looks and the
[SPEAKER_01]: less people that I'm following so on
Facebook you kind of use follow for follow
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're friends with somebody they
follow you you follow them back but on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram that algorithm really looks at
that so if no one's posting on the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're following it's again just a
ghost account it's it's worthless so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason to follow people unless
they're posting I was saying at least once
[SPEAKER_01]: a week that they're posting even once a
month it's pointless to follow them I
[SPEAKER_01]: changed my category to entrepreneur and
that seemed to also boost my following as
[SPEAKER_01]: well when I changed it from just it's a
college and university so whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys find some people like to put public
figure some people that I would imagine a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people would like to put
entrepreneur sometime a brand or business
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is another way that the algorithm
finds your account so not only am I an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur but I'm a living soil of
cannabis entrepreneur and that's the way
[SPEAKER_01]: the algorithm sees that I've been rep
Sunleaf seed and dominion seed company
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke diamond and Derek they're actually
out there today if you guys want to check
[SPEAKER_01]: out their their seeds and stuff but it's
brands that I admire and so I put that at
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the list because I want people
to know that these are the people that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with with a business account
you're able to then have touch hashtags
[SPEAKER_01]: and touch that button so I'm able to show
off that not only do I work hand-in-hand
[SPEAKER_01]: with seed companies I am a public speaker
and I've also spoke around the country at
[SPEAKER_01]: these places and hats off to Shanga Lowe's
because I also in Portland gave a talk on
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil that has kind of gone pretty
well I'd say on that platform I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're over 20,000 watches yeah so that's
another way that you can continue to build
[SPEAKER_01]: your platform through Instagram is by code
promoting so I try to get an action item
[SPEAKER_01]: so I show a little video with a finger
pointing down again this is a living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: video and then this goes to shankos
YouTube so it's really easy for anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that finds out about me to find out more
about me and I try to make that as easy as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible I then have little highlights of
what I've done throughout the the week and
[SPEAKER_01]: then of course my posts so for 2020 this
is kind of the way that Instagram wants
[SPEAKER_01]: you to start doing hashtags and tagging
people where you're actually writing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the context of what you're saying in that
text bar so instead of just you know these
[SPEAKER_01]: are the same same photos this is a
gentleman in Oklahoma I thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: funny so I reposted it I don't know if you
guys have been out to Oklahoma but
[SPEAKER_01]: especially this time last year this was
the kind of stuff that a lot of these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: were throwing so I thought it was funny
made a little meme this gentleman has very
[SPEAKER_01]: little on here just a few hashtags every
single hashtag that you have is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to that to that main platform so if I
have organic cannabis and you click on
[SPEAKER_01]: that hashtag it goes to all those organic
cannabis photos as soon as this is posted
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to go to the most recent but
my goal is to get seen your goal is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: seen so you're using those hashtags but
you want to try to find hashtags that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can rank for because they have a what's
called top post top nine if you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: one of your posts to be in that top nine
sometimes that will last for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's really how people start to
find you so I write this out I tag the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are with I start to look up
and research hashtags that I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: can rank for I give credit because this
obviously isn't my photo I give shout outs
[SPEAKER_01]: to people that I admire over the years and
as you guys can see I get way more
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement by doing it this way so
hashtags is really the basis of Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is where you guys really need to
take the time to start to do the research
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say start off with ten at a time
so I would research ten hashtags for that
[SPEAKER_01]: week find out what they are all you really
need to do is going into your Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: with the little search icon type in a
organic cannabis hit that tag and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those photos especially that top nine will
pop up so it'll show you like if you hit
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis right now I guarantee it's still
at 20.4 million tags so when we make a
[SPEAKER_01]: post what you want to do is try to get a
little bit of these larger hashtags so I
[SPEAKER_01]: know when I make a post most of these
hashtags might last 15 minutes where
[SPEAKER_01]: people are seeing it because so many
people are using that hashtag that it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: lost in the feed but at the same time 15
minutes on a large hashtag like that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get a hundred likes if it's quality
photo then I go down and I try to do like
[SPEAKER_01]: medium-sized stuff so these hashtags when
I make a post would probably last maybe 15
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 minutes 30 minutes depending on how
many people are on the platform for that
[SPEAKER_01]: day and then I do more like niche type
stuff that is relevant to me so I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: big on quality we kind of jumped on the
bandwagon I would grow like a pro and then
[SPEAKER_01]: these two tags I obviously create so if
you have a brand create something that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is relevant to you it doesn't even
really matter if a lot of people see that
[SPEAKER_01]: because not many people are using living
soil solutions hashtag but if they do go
[SPEAKER_01]: and click that they're going to see all of
my posts or my business partners posts so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really important to make sure that
you guys use a few that go out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to the top where there's
millions of people looking at that on a
[SPEAKER_01]: daily basis Instagram stories you guys use
an Instagram stories this is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: new frontier if you're not seeing a lot of
action on your post I assure you if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: have a quality following you'll see a lot
of action on your stories a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even want to scroll through the feed
anymore they just want to sit there and
[SPEAKER_01]: hold their phone and sit there and watch
the stories scroll so I I encourage you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys this is more of like the daily kind
of stuff so if you're just daily here at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of expo show take a quick photo
put that in your stories if it's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know you haven't seen a buddy in
a long time and you're making a photo and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want something to be permanent then
that's what I would post up in your actual
[SPEAKER_01]: post feed where people will see that
usually for years to come and Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: stories is a little bit different than
just your normal hashtags Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: stories only last for 24 hours so our goal
is to go big so we never want to use niche
[SPEAKER_01]: type hashtags unless we're at a like a
niche type event other wise you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use these larger hashtags so if you're
doing something with cannabis like
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously a 420 sticky hashtag it's going
to be a lot pop a lot more popular than
[SPEAKER_01]: just my living soil solutions not many
people are going to see that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: again it only lasts for 24 hours so who's
heard of Gary V that guy crushes it so
[SPEAKER_01]: this really is the secret of how I've been
able to organically build my Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: from 4,000 followers to 17,000 followers
with no gimmicks and it's the dollar 80
[SPEAKER_01]: principle so basically what I do is I go
around and I put my two cents in on these
[SPEAKER_01]: top nine photos for these ten hashtags
that I've just done research on so every
[SPEAKER_01]: day I'm putting my two cents in on those
top nine and then that's what I allows me
[SPEAKER_01]: to get to that dollar 80 so this stuff
usually takes probably an hour or two of
[SPEAKER_01]: my time every single day there really is
no secret there's no automation anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like going to the gym you
either put in the work and you do this
[SPEAKER_01]: formula you will see your Instagram grow I
guarantee you and if you stick with this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for 90 days I assure you you're
going to start getting hundreds if
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes thousands of followers a week
because you're posting your two cents on
[SPEAKER_01]: those top nine photos and sometimes those
top nine photos will last for years so
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I'll put like hey check out
organic cannabis 303 organic cannabis I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: repping Sunleaf seeds at Endo Expo and
I'll and I'll post that or if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that makes like a really good
photo hey great photo somebody who's been
[SPEAKER_01]: working out that kind of stuff hey man
swole that kind of stuff so you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to engage with your audience
without making it come off as spam does
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody kind of get how this yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and then this is it in real time so I just
click on organic marijuana these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: top posts for that hashtag and then I just
go through those top nine start to scroll
[SPEAKER_01]: down like the photo add a comment and
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that for all top nine and I do that
for ten hashtags every single day and I
[SPEAKER_01]: promise you stick with that for 90 days
and your account will explode but there is
[SPEAKER_01]: no shortcut so I see another gentleman I
agreed with that little meme hashtag to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that the account owners sees it
and then I just keep it moving I if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: following someone I make sure that I go
through and I like every single one of
[SPEAKER_01]: their photos for that day I'm not one of
these guys that I don't like that photo so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna like it my goal is to build
a brand on Instagram so all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I follow already I like them so I'm
going to give them a like every time that
[SPEAKER_01]: I do put a like on their photo it pops up
303 organic cannabis like this photo so
[SPEAKER_01]: that means that when people that are also
following me when they see that same photo
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to also see that 303 organic
cannabis like that photo here's some more
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff from indo Expo last year
[SPEAKER_01]: so like some of my friends here right they
also like that photo and that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that I'm following I make sure
that I like their photo as best as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to keep up that several times a
day because this is also brandy people you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you get 863 likes on a photo that
probably means you know double that amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of people actually probably saw that photo
so it's a good metric for me to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: gauge how people like my content whether
they didn't like that content and then
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my these are the amount of
followers that I've actually gotten in
[SPEAKER_01]: real time again I've been shadow banned
last year so anybody know what that means
[SPEAKER_01]: so shadow banning is when I'm using my
hashtags and it it's not showing up in
[SPEAKER_01]: that hashtag feed so I put organic
cannabis if you click on that doesn't show
[SPEAKER_01]: up in that hashtag that's what's known as
shadow banning that's how they punish you
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will for not doing what Instagram's
asking and I got punished pretty heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: with this because I was using automation
software if this sounds too daunting for
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys especially like I mean it really
is an hour and a half to two hours every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day of going through and liking
stuff on Instagram to be able to build
[SPEAKER_01]: your profile my opinion is then focused on
LinkedIn I think this is going to be huge
[SPEAKER_01]: for 2020 and beyond and it's very easy to
gain traction are a lot of you guys on
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn as well yeah it's pretty
confusing though right I mean you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: look through there and there's there's
still kind of a lot of spam stuff but you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys know who owns LinkedIn nobody
Microsoft Microsoft owns LinkedIn so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's deep money behind this so that's
another platform that's not going to fail
[SPEAKER_01]: like mass roots or like duty that's going
to run out of money so I would put my time
[SPEAKER_01]: and attention to some of these that you
know are going to stick around for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time and there's not really that many
people that engage on LinkedIn so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot easier to start to build that brand I
would co-brand with that kind of stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: show people your other profiles then they
at the end of the day my goal is to give
[SPEAKER_01]: people whether they look me up by my name
Brian Walksman or by my Instagram handle
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of things start to pop up on on
the Google search engines now if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a website usually you have to hire
somebody that really understands SEO to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to get to the top of that but a hack
would be if you can start to improve your
[SPEAKER_01]: social media profiles Google loves those
profiles especially YouTube that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because they own that platform so
they'll put your information at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: that that the top ten search feed and
that's really where anybody at least
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays seems to go if you're not in that
top ten most people don't go to page two
[SPEAKER_01]: page three and the easiest way to get to
that top ten is through social media so I
[SPEAKER_01]: left this open because I really like to
engage with you guys on questions so guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have a few questions so I think tick-tock
is is going to be huge right now it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of gimmicky and it's young but I
definitely feel like it's going to here to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay so that is probably something you
know probably this year I'll start to
[SPEAKER_01]: research and learn on my own but right now
I just don't have enough knowledge of
[SPEAKER_01]: tick-tock to kind of help anyone right now
couple questions you said that cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: general is not allowed on Instagram are
you talking about sales of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products Instagram will not allow
you to pay to promote and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: how a lot of these marketing companies get
by with stuff so if I was selling teapots
[SPEAKER_01]: right I could pay to have those teapots
promoted on that platform but because
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is federally illegal they will
not allow you to promote so right now all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us are on the same playing field as
some of these large brands and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that small little window that some of you
guys can continue to build your brands
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I was showing that infographic
how much money is really starting to be
[SPEAKER_01]: spent on advertising cannabis none of that
money can be spent on these social media
[SPEAKER_02]: platforms at this time but you're also
you'd say just a plant part not for people
[SPEAKER_02]: that sell lights or supporting products or
containers it's just a plant there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that can get away with that but if
you're using the hashtag cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that the algorithm is going
to eventually see that okay and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: said the 710 lab guys were super rad had a
great page so I go look they got 220,000
[SPEAKER_02]: likes or followers but their page is
private so some people believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram isn't going to delete your
account if you keep it private they have
[SPEAKER_01]: such a following and such a known name
around the country that they're able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that in my opinion if you're a business
especially a cannabis business there it's
[SPEAKER_01]: silly to keep your profile private because
no one's going to be able to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you already have that brand but for
most of us in this room we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: build that brand so if we keep that
profile private no one's going to see it
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to probably end up buying
info no no pricing whatsoever more
[SPEAKER_05]: questions I know you got on raise your
hand
[SPEAKER_01]: yes sir the algorithm likes it when you
physically hit that button so I would
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly I would move away from anything
automated especially for 2020 and
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram hates automation because
especially on these third-party platforms
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are spending money with them
eventually they want us to spend money on
[SPEAKER_01]: their platform so that's why they're not
allowing us to be on that Explorer page
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of stuff because they really
want us to do it correctly or that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna get hammered like I did last year we
just got hootsuite so we can schedule so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what you're saying they won't they
don't like that no ma'am hootsuite was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool like five years ago yeah that's
anything automated really is dying off
[SPEAKER_01]: even with the influencer marketing that I
was talking about from before right
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram hates influencer marketing
because those big brands are using those
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram models to promote everything so
that's why they in my opinion that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: they got rid of the likes last year for
from the majority of the accounts because
[SPEAKER_01]: you take away those lights from likes from
the influencer pages and nobody really
[SPEAKER_01]: knows how powerful that account is on
Instagram anymore it'll just say so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people and thousands others of others like
that photo
[SPEAKER_01]: no you're that's what I mean you're kind
of you're out there in the ocean if you
[SPEAKER_01]: will and there's really no way I mean one
day Instagram could come and delete your
[SPEAKER_01]: account and that's what I meant from
before like we are building our houses on
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else's land and they can come and
take that away from us at any time so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I wanted to show you guys in
real time what Instagram will start to do
[SPEAKER_01]: and start to threaten you if you do not
play by the rules they're very secretive
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way the algorithm works the same
way that Google is for a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: webmasters trying to figure out how to get
your brands on that top ten list is the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing with Instagram everybody sits
around and tries to figure out what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best way to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of the same way I mean right now
my strategy on LinkedIn is just to post
[SPEAKER_01]: quality content and you don't really have
to be on it as much because Microsoft is
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing a lot of money into that because
they want to compete with Instagram the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the people since they're
already posting on Instagram they just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have enough time to go and do these
other platforms so how do we get more
[SPEAKER_01]: people to come to LinkedIn well we start
to encourage other people to see these
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles so you can post pretty gimmicky
stuff on LinkedIn you'll still have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand two thousand people see that work
on Instagram I mean you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have quality content to get a thousand
likes we are out of time thank you very
[SPEAKER_05]: much to Brian Watson Brian you can stop
the questions afterwards you you you you
