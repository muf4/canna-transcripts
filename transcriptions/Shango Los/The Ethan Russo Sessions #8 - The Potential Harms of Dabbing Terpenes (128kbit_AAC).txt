[SPEAKER_00]: People are getting a lot more terpenes now
than humans normally have with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had this long, long relationship
with cannabis and so our lungs and human
[SPEAKER_00]: have become adapted to interacting with
the cannabis plant as whole flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we are extracting it and
concentrating it and so when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: either vaping the oil or doing dabs,
they're getting a much higher intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes than they would if they were
just smoking a joint or making a tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people are, you know, they're
painting their slabs, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: with additional terpenes to like turn up
the flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering what your thoughts and
perhaps cautions are about spiking
[SPEAKER_00]: smokable products with terpenes that were
not in the original flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think it's a good approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, let's look at what can the plant do
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we know that the cannabinoids and
terpenoids are produced in the glandular
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be a nice method of
concentration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got an old name, hashish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, pure preparation of glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get potentially THC or total
cannabinoid content of six to 60%,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with preservation of the terpenoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: As people know, only a small amount of
that is necessary to have a pronounced
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly for a medical patient,
hopefully one inhalation is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis concentrates, dabs,
we're going beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're usually producing THC in the range
of 70 to 90% with a loss of terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: People may add them in, but we're getting
into the range of too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, there are no medical indications
that require this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for chronic conditions,
I feel that tinctures or oral agents are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a better solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once more, I don't agree with the idea of
spiking terpenoids from external sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not be the right structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, on the other hand, they're from a
natural source, from an essential oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'd be a little bit better,
but might be a wiser precaution to use
[SPEAKER_01]: that in an aromatherapy diffuser to
modulate things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a proponent of dabs or this kind
of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say that when you're spiking a
smokable product and the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than they would be in the flower,
that this is too much, what's the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: that that much terpene may have on the
body, which signals you that it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could be any number of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could provoke anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's having an adverse effect on the
lungs, it could provoke coughing,
[SPEAKER_01]: phlegm production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are going to have even
not-so-subtle signals that the body will
[SPEAKER_01]: give them in this type of situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, my strong belief is that the
plant does it better and we should use it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a guide to what really can be done
conventionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like trichome preparation,
is about as concentrated as cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: should ever need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.
Thank you.
