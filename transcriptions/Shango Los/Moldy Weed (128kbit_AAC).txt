[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there shango from Vimeo here,
and I'm going to show you something not
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly seen by patients and marijuana
enthusiasts when you're not a grower At
[SPEAKER_00]: first sight this looks like a beautiful
Northwest, but already to almost ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: be Harvested, but if you flip it over Get
on in there This is what mold looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: see the the gray areas towards the inside
that is where This big beautiful bud
[SPEAKER_00]: filled in and there was not enough airflow
to get through and into all the flowers So
[SPEAKER_00]: then this starts to grow on the inside
This isn't good because it can take over
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole flower itself, and then you lose
You know the whole cola, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to patients This can make
them even sicker and for folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know cannabis enthusiasts You
don't want to smoke this because it tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make you cough and if you've got
Asthma that's not a win so anyway moldy
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy flower is not something that a lot
of folks see on the consumer end So just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to show you moldy weed You
