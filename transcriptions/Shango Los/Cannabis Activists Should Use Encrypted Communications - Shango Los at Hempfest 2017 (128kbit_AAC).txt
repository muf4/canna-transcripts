[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to point out is that,
you know, social media like Facebook is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really great way to recruit people because
you can find them so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to encourage you that if
you're going to found your own
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, as soon as you've started to
recruit your people and you start doing
[SPEAKER_00]: planning for events, get off Facebook
because Facebook is not protected speech
[SPEAKER_00]: and the statements that you make in
private communications are not in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself some, you know, encryption,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start using an app like Signal on your
phone so your conversations with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you're organizing with are
encrypted and is something that the NSA
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot get their hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start to use a mailing list like at Rise
Up so that you know that your archives are
[SPEAKER_00]: being encrypted and preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we enjoy a lot of liberty here
in Washington, I'm working with people all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time across the country who are in
states like Idaho and you are still
[SPEAKER_00]: targets and we're still targets here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So err on the safe side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your recruiting with something like
Facebook or Twitter, but then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start bringing together core members,
transition to something encrypted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
