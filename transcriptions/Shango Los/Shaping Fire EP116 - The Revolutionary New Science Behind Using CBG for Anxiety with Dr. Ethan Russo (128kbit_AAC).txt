[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter who you are,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern life is stressful and causes
various forms of anxiety in all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many recommended actions we
can take to help reduce that stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exercise, meditation, eating whole foods
to keep our gut biome happy, and working
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to resolve the source of stress
are all proven to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Various pharmaceuticals come and go in
popularity and supposedly help,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most are either addictive or
eventually debunked as ineffective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans have been turning to cannabis for
anxiety relief for thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are several different ways that
we can use cannabis to relieve stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will discuss several of them today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to focus on a brand new
scientific study published just last week
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the cannabinoid cannabigerol,
known as CBG, to reduce anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results are truly remarkable and
will absolutely influence the direction of
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety medicine research going forward
and how we as cannabis enthusiasts avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety too.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode 116.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo is a board certified
neurologist and former senior medical
[SPEAKER_01]: advisor to GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has served as study physician to GW
Pharmaceuticals for three phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials of Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has held faculty appointments in
pharmaceutical sciences at the University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Montana, in medicine at the University
of Washington, and as visiting professor
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been president of the International
Cannabinoid Research Society and is former
[SPEAKER_01]: chairman of the International Association
for Cannabinoid Medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis, and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is presently founder of Credo Science,
where he works to formulate cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutics for the good of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo has joined us before on Shaping
Fire several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 22 on treating traumatic brain
injury with cannabis and mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes 11 and 27 about his famous
research papers on cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: turpinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode number 67 about treating migraines
with mushrooms and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 80 on cannabinoid heparaminosis
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 83 on the cannabinoid CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 103 regarding the life's work of
Dr. Rafael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 110 taking a good look at Delta 8
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the Shaping Fire sessions
on the Shaping Fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set today, we will review
what we know about CBG, cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at the results of prior CBG
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also discuss using isolate versus
whole plant preparations during scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second set, we will review the
mechanics of the study and look pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: closely at the various ways participants
were made to be anxious and the battery of
[SPEAKER_01]: skills test participants were given while
anxious and using CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the third set, we will look at
the groundbreaking and really remarkable
[SPEAKER_01]: results from this study and compare using
CBG to other cannabinoids like CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_01]: for reducing anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to be back with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, you know, why don't we do
something new?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why don't we start with giving some
respect to your other co-authors on this
[SPEAKER_01]: paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was led by Dr. Kerry Cutler of
Washington State University, who's an
[SPEAKER_00]: associate professor of psychology there
and has done fantastic work on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, her graduate student, Amanda Stuber,
did a lot of the interviewing for folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ziva Cooper, who's a professor at
UCLA and heads the cannabis research
[SPEAKER_00]: program there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the more and more I get into the
science side in depth in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more I realize how important every
single person on a paper is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think I like this and I think
we'll start plugging those other
[SPEAKER_01]: co-authors as going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started by creating a little
bit of context for Cannabigerol for folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who are relatively new to CBG as a
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, clearly, throughout this entire show,
we're going to be talking about CBG in
[SPEAKER_01]: significant detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the moment, would you just give us
a general understanding of CBG as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to 1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the year that Rafael Mishulam and
Yachil Gaoni identified, finally,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, as the main
psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that same year, they also discovered
cannabigerol and were quite prescient in
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying it as a precursor to all the
other major cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it started there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, all the attention was
focused on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol had been discovered or
identified with clear ideas to its
[SPEAKER_00]: structure only the prior year in 1963.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there was not this overt
psychoactivity to some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, they got much less attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was certainly the case with
cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some initial studies looking
at what it did in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really didn't get the attention it
deserved for perhaps another 30 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would have caused the interest in CBG
to increase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, along the line, people did take a
look at certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 70s, it was shown that CBG is an
uptake inhibitor for GABA, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitory neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that is important is that it could
account for muscle relaxant activity and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly for some activity as an
anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we'll certainly be talking about
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, in 2006, it was shown that
there was an antidepressant effect in tail
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension models in rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, it was shown that there is
a mild effect of CBG to lower blood
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure and also to lower intraocular
pressure the way THC does in glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, during this interval,
in the early 2000s, there was a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this was spearheaded through
support of GW Pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was working at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a program of selective breeding
for the so-called minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those was Cannabigero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chief breeder there, Etienda Meyer,
actually developed a CBG only plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a good bit of basic research
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, it was shown that CBG
stimulates several TRIP channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially TRIP M8.
[SPEAKER_00]: M is sort of like, it's named for menthol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a temperature sensitive
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRIP M8 is important because certain
tumors, especially prostate cancer and
[SPEAKER_00]: some breast cancer lines would be targets
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it was shown that there were
antibiotic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong effects against methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was shown by Appendino et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important result because at the
time, there were all these hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired infections and many deaths
related to MRSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this remains an area of great interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two of the big things were this effect
on certain cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should point out that CBG,
like just about all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, shows a great selectivity in
its ability to kill cancer cells while
[SPEAKER_00]: being preservative for normal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important distinction because
standard chemotherapy agents tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic to cells in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always an issue of, can you kill
the tumor before you kill the patient or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least make them very sick in the
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who's been through chemotherapy
or has a family member or friend that has
[SPEAKER_00]: is familiar with this concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the cannabinoids, we have the
prospect of having much more selective
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to kill cancer without producing
overt toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This study reminds us a couple times that
there are nearly no CBG studies that
[SPEAKER_01]: involve humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we know quite a bit about CBG and
have pretty good ideas about other things
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to research in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me kind of a vibe that there is a
bit of a sea change as far as human
[SPEAKER_01]: research into CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody who is doing this research on
the front lines, do you feel that as well
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're at a transition point where
we're moving out of purely rodent studies
[SPEAKER_01]: and moving more and more into CBG studies
in humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, quite true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for better or worse, there's been
all this attention on THC and then
[SPEAKER_00]: starting about 15 years ago, CBD came to
the fore mainly because of its utility in
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, which is well deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think people would understand that
CBD has sort of peaked in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly is a very versatile
therapeutic molecule, but perhaps it
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't quite panned out from a business
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly true for many companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, lost in the shuffle were other
candidates, particularly CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that has changed recently because
certainly on the West Coast of the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: there has been selective breeding again,
leading to CBG predominant or CBG only
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovars of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really started in the Northwest,
particularly with Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And slowly, CBG interest and breeding has
diffused to the rest of the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along the way, certainly there have
been a lot of people, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest U.S., that have been using CBG
for some years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have there what the scientists
call anecdotal experience, what patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumers report.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only recently that there have
been the formal clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like to think that we've been at
the forefront of that with our survey
[SPEAKER_00]: study that was published in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this, which was the first study to
examine in a randomized controlled trial
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects of CBG on anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to agree with you, Ethan,
that it is no small impact that the CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant cultivars from Seth and Eric
Crawford there at Oregon CBD down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Albany, Oregon, has really made a
difference here in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: because up until their CBG dominant
cultivar, mostly we were getting CBG in
[SPEAKER_01]: THC dominant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to tell anything
either in a controlled study or just
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotally when THC is the primary
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you can strip that out and make a
CBG dominant hemp cultivar where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly entirely CBG, this opens up not
only the ability for that plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: to find its way to research scientists
like you, but also it really gives a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of strength to what some call anecdotal
evidence, some call citizenry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea that CBG gets itself into
the hands of caregivers who don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have the same constraints as legitimate
science do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the initial grunt work
about what we should even look for can
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really grateful for those single
cannabinoid dominant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we'll continue to be seeing
more of them, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of selective breeding
that took place at GW Pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, because there was a
concentration on development of Sativex
[SPEAKER_00]: and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, again, never got into clinical
trials, despite the availability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG only chemivore clear back in the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just one of those things that got
lost in the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not be able to speak to this and
my awareness might not even be true,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems to me that there's probably a
whole bunch of really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars at GW that just, like you said,
kind of got lost in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't until similar cultivars are
re-bred in the public that we see a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those, because most of the pharmaceutical
companies defend that cherished IP,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you've been researching CBG
for years, and you and I have been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it for years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular study, though,
seems like it's a direct follow up to
[SPEAKER_01]: another one that you did just a couple
years back, again, with Dr. Kerry Cutler
[SPEAKER_01]: at Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bit more of a general study,
but it absolutely sets this one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you summarize that study and its
results so that we can all have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding or picture of what we're
building on top of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, we weren't in a position
yet to do a randomized control trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I thought that we really needed a
survey, a decent survey of what people
[SPEAKER_00]: were reporting with CBG preparations to
lend some credence to the idea that,
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, this could be used
therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, that there weren't any
associated problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we initiated a survey study and had 127
folks that the stipulation was they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: be adults and they had to be using a
preparation that was at least 50% CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a mixed sort of sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people were using CBG-only
products, but a lot of them were CBG with
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, and as you mentioned, that creates a
few complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we got some very
useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's talk about what people saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, what I expected was something we
did see that a lot of people were using it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the big three, which are treatment of
pain, helpless sleep, and mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the same things for which
many people turn to cannabis of one type
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we started asking about
conditions that people were treating,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got a list of 30 different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really surprising was people
reported that the CBG preparations were
[SPEAKER_00]: highly effective and often much more so
than conventional medicines that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: used for the same purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got very highly statistical
significance with claims of benefit on
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, sleep, anxiety, but also for some
hardcore medical conditions like
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of the numbers weren't big on
those specifics, but when three quarters
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people are saying that this is the
best medicine that they've ever used for
[SPEAKER_00]: their condition, it is creating a signal
that deserves attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, people were really
not reporting side effects to speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people reported dry mouth,
sleepiness, increased appetite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly that would suggest that
those were preparations that had some THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is borne out subsequently when we
looked specifically just at a CBG only
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, in this survey, 84% reported no
withdrawal symptoms when they stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our conclusions were, first,
this was the first study that really
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at therapeutic use of CBG in
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, anxiety, pain, depression,
and insomnia were the most commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: reported target symptoms, and people
reported a very high efficacy with no
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse events to speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing was we thought that
this was a good indicator that CBG would
[SPEAKER_00]: be safe for future randomized control
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we were immediately interested in
taking this forward, but it took a good
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, as these things often do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recruitment for the new study which was,
again, a randomized control trial of a CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: only chemover extract and its effect on
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This took a while to recruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was confined to people in Washington
state because that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: institutional review board wanted,
but it came together nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't I stop there for a second and
see if you have an interim question,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I could just go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find it interesting that it was
challenging to recruit for this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not only were you limited to
Washington, which has got its own
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges since you've got a national
audience, but even more so after reading
[SPEAKER_01]: the study, I can imagine that it may have
been challenging to find people who met
[SPEAKER_01]: your stipulations because, in one hand,
for somebody to be open to participating
[SPEAKER_01]: in a cannabis study, they need to be open
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the study required for them to
not be using cannabis or any other,
[SPEAKER_01]: air quotes, illicit drugs during,
I think it was a two or three month
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people, you know, they may
have had cannabis or they may have been
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing or may have done a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually continues to make the
pool of people possible much smaller,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a problem in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, we asked that people not
use cannabis for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in some studies,
they're much more stringent about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanted people that were cannabis
familiar but not necessarily heavy users.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's walking a line right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are always exclusion
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to exclude people that might
have felt that they had used CBG before
[SPEAKER_00]: and had a bad reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't use harder drugs within two
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't have a serious psychiatric
condition like schizophrenia or
[SPEAKER_00]: bipolarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't be pregnant or
breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't have any chronic
neurologic disorder or history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: serious head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, those were the kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they also had to be fluent in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to have a smartphone because one
of the tests was done on an app on a
[SPEAKER_00]: smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as mentioned previously, just in
Washington state, so there were no issues
[SPEAKER_00]: about shipping product over state lines
that might have attracted federal
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it interesting because,
you know, when you reached out that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to be working on this study,
I was excited to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I didn't get through the first
sifting process because my association
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis and other influences were
far too high for the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am happy to say that we let shaping
fire listeners know about the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have some of them in your study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to everybody who chose to
participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about the baseline study that
you did with Dr. Cutler over there at
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State University that laid down
the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you worked with Dr. Cutler to
design this new study.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the objectives for this new
study?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, again, to see if in a sort of
manufactured situation, creating anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could show that CBG made a
difference compared to placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to go back for a second
to the demographics of people's cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use because this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of studies, for instance,
in the survey, obviously, we wanted people
[SPEAKER_00]: that had used CBG before.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one, we hoped that we'd get some
people that never used CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reaction of it to somebody
that's never had it before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it turned out, 65% of the people in
the study, which was 34, had no prior
[SPEAKER_00]: experience using cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all had been cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Users in the past, the average was about
three and a half days a week or 18 days a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that in mind, again, what was the
premise of the study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll just read from the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: To examine the acute effects of
hemp-derived CBG on anxiety, stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: mood, and memory, as well as positive and
negative subjective drug effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the design is what's called a
double-blind, meaning patients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: administrators of this didn't know who was
getting what at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Placebo-controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that on one occasion,
people got the CBG preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: On another occasion, they got a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was called a crossover study
because they had to take both in separate
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called a field trial because this
was done over Zoom with patients in their
[SPEAKER_00]: home environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone asking the questions on the
other end at Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that asking people their
questions at home actually gets rid of an
[SPEAKER_01]: entire layer of anxiety-related questions
that you don't have to do anymore since
[SPEAKER_01]: people are often made to feel anxious just
by coming into a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called white coat anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use that to advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say white coat anxiety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's aptly named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that to advantage though because
part of the testing was I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this is diabolical.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we make people anxious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things was they were told
that they had five minutes to prepare to
[SPEAKER_00]: say what their ideal job would be and how
they were qualified for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were expected to talk this whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they stopped talking, they would be
prompted to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the examiner did a thing of starting
out in civilian clothing and then coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back in a white coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a thing of a
calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the usual calculation when you're
testing someone cognitively is to subtract
[SPEAKER_00]: seven from 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with a very high number,
subtracting 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time a mistake was made,
they were told to go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the diabolical ways that you
induce anxiety in a laboratory setting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's amazing how effective they are
for being so gentle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not actually putting them
under threat, but it sure can feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be talking more about those in
the second set too, because this battery
[SPEAKER_01]: of tests that you gave people were
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this set, let's finish with this
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most studies that are happening on
cannabis nowadays, they default to using
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I prefer whole resin,
most studies are using isolate because it
[SPEAKER_01]: is just one specific molecule instead of
being the cannabis resin, which has got
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of components in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we know that generally speaking,
using resin offers better benefits from
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate, which has got its own problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you choose to go with a whole
plant CBG dominant resin solution in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture for the study instead of going
with isolate, which is probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: easily available and also is what all your
peers and pharmaceuticals are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we wanted real world experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, the study drug was a CBG
extract that has been used by a good
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew a little bit about what to
expect from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely wanted a CBG only
preparation to the extent that there be no
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, no significant amount of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, each milliliter of the study
drug had 10 milligrams of CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were barely any THC, 0.01 milligrams
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only significant terpenoid was
0.35 milligrams of karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we don't expect to be overtly
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each person in the study drug set got
two milliliters of this material in a
[SPEAKER_00]: glass of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 20 milligrams of CBG and not a
lot else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it was a real challenge to figure out
a placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the placebo would be something that
wouldn't be psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To any great extent, but it should look
like the study drug and have a taste that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be hard to tell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I racked my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was part of my contribution of the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we use that would have this
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wondered, how about an herbal
preparation, but one that wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want something that's sort of
green, like the study drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought about the liqueur chartreuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who don't know, chartreuse is
from Europe, hundreds of years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: originally made by monks, said to be made
with somewhere between 50 and 100
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a distinct herbal taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use that as the placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I read that in the study,
Ethan, I just howled sitting in my living
[SPEAKER_01]: room, because number one, it's really
humorous to see chartreuse so out of place
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a bartender in my 20s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, of course, very familiar with
chartreuse, but I didn't expect to see it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the study while I was reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it makes so much sense because
even though chartreuse has got a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness to it, it is so herbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you watered it way down,
I totally see how it could become an
[SPEAKER_01]: effective placebo that looks and acts like
a tincture without the active components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find that it worked out pretty
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would think that that would be a
home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody said that I'm aware of
that we know this is the drug and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that this one isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, people were sent vials that had
color code on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person administering didn't know
what was what.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to maintain the blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it was quite effective in
this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, since since the name of the
individual is in the study, we might as
[SPEAKER_01]: well go ahead and mention who provided the
CBD tincture for the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might find that novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this came from Munchango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I was happy to do my bit for
science, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am grateful to have participated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, so let's go ahead and take
our first break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get back, we're going to talk a
lot about the battery of tests that were
[SPEAKER_01]: given to the research participants,
because since this study is pointing
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically to how CBG helps with
anxiety, it's going to be very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at these different tests and
figure out how they tease at anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is neurologist Dr.
Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb Inspekta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspekta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were here on Vashon Island,
and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential, and that is what
we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_01]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of their headphones right now,
and will continue to reach new listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: as they explore the Shaping Fire back
catalog of episodes again and again for
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: and entrepreneurs who are always curious
to learn.

[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: which further enhance nutrient
availability for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is neurologist, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
the study that this new study was based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the various advantages that we're starting
to see teased out of CBG, and specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: this study, how it looked at the anxiety
of patients and CBG's ability to decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how the study is designed is
remarkable because what it has to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: subtly push people's buttons in different
ways and see whether or not they can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle having their anxiety buttons pushed
with the study drug versus the placebo,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we now know was just very watered
down chartreuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the study consisted of two interviews
between the research assistant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: participant one week apart via Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the interview, the research
subject ingests a vial of either 20
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of whole plant CBG tincture or
the watered down chartreuse placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when the interviewer starts,
some baseline demographic questions are
[SPEAKER_01]: asked just to kind of like get them
talking, but then a whole battery of tests
[SPEAKER_01]: take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to say, Ethan, reading about
them in the study, they really seem
[SPEAKER_01]: numerous and varied and designed to stress
like any kind of person out in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do any permanent damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know we've got a handful of them and
they all work in slightly different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I just want to hand you the mic
and let you walk us through these
[SPEAKER_01]: batteries tests and teach us what they are
and what their goal was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the zero point, they had baseline
assessments, mood, anxiety, stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drug effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may seem strange to ask about drug
effect questions when nothing's on board,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to establish comparison
before the drug is administered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, as you mentioned,
they take the CBG tincture or the
[SPEAKER_00]: chartreuse placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they take an online survey using up
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first testing was at the 20 minute
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mention here, we got a
criticism from one reviewer about why did
[SPEAKER_00]: you start then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably wasn't doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the interim, there was a
pharmacokinetics study done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacokinetics is what are the effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for certain effects
to appear?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to show that when people
took CBG orally, that the effects begin
[SPEAKER_00]: and are seemingly well established by the
20 minute mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the 20 minute mark, there were tests
of mood, anxiety, stress, and drug effect
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they take the thing called a Trier
social stress test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get more ratings of all those
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then between 45 and 60 minutes,
they'd have the California verbal learning
[SPEAKER_00]: test too, which assesses memory
impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd have the Druid application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Druid is an app that's designed to assess
motor and reaction times and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that's been
validated and it's done on a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at time three, it's 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the mood, anxiety, stress,
and drug effect ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were different time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you mentioned, these different
types of testing to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in choosing these studies, did you
approach them as, okay, these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that are always used by scientists
who study anxiety, like where this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: preset battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you, as the designer of the study,
have to go and choose these yourself off
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf because they're the ones that
you respect and the ones that we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to tease out the kind of data points that
you wanted to look at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to figure out whether or
not these are like boilerplate studies or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not this was more of a custom
ordeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there are always
differences, but these are well accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: types of studies to look at these
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what I could say,
if you looked at studies from Johns
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopkins, like the Lymanine and THC
studies, study we just did, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap in the tests that were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are time tested measures that are
well accepted in the scientific community.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at these tests, and they
want to come about this a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that anxiety comes in a lot of
different forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people on Vashon Island here where I
live have been taking CBG tincture for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the results that people speak back
anecdotally, they review different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of anxiety that the tincture helps with.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you were designing the study,
what were you looking to pull out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: various tests that you were giving folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not asking you to necessarily go
through them all, but so we can understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how to scientifically think through these
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you maybe compare two or three of
them and say, well, this one is looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of anxiety versus this one's
looking at the different type of anxiety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unfortunately, most people who
have anxiety, they just say, I'm anxious
[SPEAKER_01]: without ever having had the opportunity to
think about what kind of anxiety they may
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are different types of free
floating anxiety, so-called would just be
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling anxious in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Situational anxiety would be I get
stressed when I have to go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, although I was a psych major in
college, I'm not an expert on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can assure you that Dr. Cutler and
Dr. Cooper are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, one of the tests is called the
state anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another is more specific for stress,
as might be precipitated by subtracting 17
[SPEAKER_00]: from a high number and having to repeat
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think I've given you a great
answer, but what I can say is that over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, we saw these statistically
significant differences in the these folks
[SPEAKER_00]: tested twice between their experience on
the CBG and their experience on the
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it wasn't always one before
the other, it was random as to which came
[SPEAKER_00]: first, you can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a matter of, well,
I'm not stressed because I knew they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have me subtract 17 from a high
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't as bad the second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, these are set up in a way that
there shouldn't be these big practice
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to poke at that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The term practice effects is one I'm
unfamiliar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be what I'm asking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, so let's assume that the
tincture that was the CBG tincture
[SPEAKER_01]: presented a certain way and then the
chartreuse presented a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both seem like they could have
been the CBG tincture, which was the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those of us who do use CBG regularly,
it really has a huge effect on anxiety in
[SPEAKER_01]: my own opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my own personal experience,
I've experienced this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a data point that speaks at
all to what degree the test subjects were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to determine which one was likely the
study drug, not based on presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but based on, oh my god, this works so
much better than the one other one I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one must have been the placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we didn't record people's
reaction that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to probe too deeply at this
point when you're trying to get two sets
[SPEAKER_00]: of data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you might get varying degrees
of response in an individual, but you need
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, 34 folks to see what the
overall effect is and whether it has
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my answer to your very pertinent
question is we rate the benefit in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I need to give a little primer on
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistics, the lower the number is,
the more significant it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something is considered medically
significant if it has a probability or
[SPEAKER_00]: p-value under 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is there's less than one
chance in 20 that the results occurred due
[SPEAKER_00]: to chance, meaning that when it's 0.05,
or less, we consider that likely a real
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the numbers are smaller,
it's more statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this instance, in the subjective
anxiety ratios, there was a moderately
[SPEAKER_00]: large size, significant effect of the
condition, meaning one versus the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: that p-value was 0.034, so under the 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, it was very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So p-value of 0.001, that means one chance
in 1,000 that this could be just a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time there's one chance in 1,000 that
it really is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, the stress ratings,
the effect over time, p-value of 0.001,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a large size, simple effect of the
condition on the change in subjective
[SPEAKER_00]: stress ratings, again, a 0.032.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under the 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there were not major
changes in mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing called the state anxiety scores,
again, showed a large, statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant main effect over time,
0.001.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we were looking at the graphs from
the study, you can see that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear demarcation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's space between the effects on
placebo and the effects on CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger the space between those,
the more significant it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these, you can see that the differences
are pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, this wasn't a situation
where we asked people for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: introspection on what they thought was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really had to be objective,
meaning what did the test show?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it would have been
interesting to ask people more about their
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed these clear statistical and
significant changes looking at anxiety and
[SPEAKER_00]: stress with these standardized measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at what cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, were the people impaired
when this happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can make someone no longer
anxious by sedating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would really be important is to
have benefit on anxiety without sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at other measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the measure of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a place where if there were a
lot of THC, you'd expect you'd get
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference between that
preparation and placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had drug effect ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is asking people about their
reactions and how much they liked the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most often, cannabis users in a
clinical trial setting will report that
[SPEAKER_00]: they liked a certain amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three measures there, but we saw no
significant differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabigerol and the placebo at any time
point with respect to intoxication
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were almost straight lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with drug effect and same with drug
liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no space between the lines at the three
time points, 20 minutes, 45 minutes and 60
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really remarkable because if you
test any other drug, used for anxiety like
[SPEAKER_00]: a benzodiazepine, Valium, Diazepam,
almost always there's gonna be significant
[SPEAKER_00]: sedation or other complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just didn't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another dimension here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I wanna talk a little more
about subjective drug effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are rated zero not at all to 10
extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there were no significant
differences between CBG and placebo at any
[SPEAKER_00]: of the three time points, 20 minutes,
45 minutes or 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, if we have a drug that's good
for anxiety, we wanna make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not producing any impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So memory tests were part of the trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a very surprising and important thing
happened, which was people on the CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: actually did better on the memory tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a moderate size significant
effect of the condition and that's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: probability of 0.05 level and a large
statistically significant effect over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, meaning looking at all the time
points and that P value was 0.001.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that supports the idea that on this
verbal memory test that the performance
[SPEAKER_00]: was significantly better on CBG than it
was on placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what you expect from most
studies of this type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, lacking THC, CBG is a different
kettle of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is distinctly different in what
it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, this might be the most
surprising finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was definitely surprising to me
reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually kind of like a plot test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a plot twist in a book as I was
reading the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I didn't know that was here
and I certainly didn't expect it coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that this next question is
outside the scope of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a neurologist and as somebody who
has spent their life studying cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you have an opinion, which is,
do you think that the improved memory was
[SPEAKER_01]: more related to something that CBG was
doing to actually improve memory function?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it was because memory was
increased in the absence of the anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: which the CBG had solved for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's likely the latter, that the
reduction in anxiety in a test situation
[SPEAKER_00]: led to better performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that might not only be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be memory enhancing properties
and that is going to have to be teased out
[SPEAKER_00]: in subsequent studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty more to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to indicate that there was one
final thing that we tested that was again
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the question of impairment of
any type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, again, CBG showed lack of
impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Participants performed significantly
better in the trial times two and three
[SPEAKER_00]: after taking CBG than they did on placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something that may not really
have been expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like to say is what the world
needs now is an effective drug for
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't produce impairment or
sedation or addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may have it in the form of
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a big statement that I can get
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you have anything else to add
regarding the conclusions of the study,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to go to break and we'll after
the set break, we will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: ramifications and next steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you have anything else regarding
the conclusions of the study?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you want to tuck in here before we
move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could summarize now or after the
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since you're going to summarize,
let's summarize after the break because
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll be summarizing a couple different
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire and
my guest today is neurologist Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack that can be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so many varieties in one pack is a
sign of an immature seed line that hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been worked enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 10 years, gnome automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages,
[SPEAKER_01]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and experience, choose gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shaping fire Instagram has follow up
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Lose Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Lose and join our
[SPEAKER_01]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_01]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the revolution seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most desired verified genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including sour diesel, triangle kush,
wedding cake, chem dogs, skittles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_01]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_01]: one-to-one THC to THCV and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric,
[SPEAKER_01]: and partially powered by their two acres
of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los, and my guest today
[SPEAKER_01]: is neurologist, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are in the big third set,
wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Ethan, throughout our
conversation, the thing that really tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to glow big in this study is that 78% of
the participants said that CBG works
[SPEAKER_01]: better than their pharmaceutical or other
traditional medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a staggeringly successful
number in my eyes that nearly 80% of
[SPEAKER_01]: people said that CBG was better than
whatever they normally use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this stand out to you as a research
scientist too, being like an oh my God
[SPEAKER_01]: moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a surprise to me that it was
that high, but perhaps in retrospect with
[SPEAKER_00]: three years since then, it's less of a
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a surprise to me because in our
formulation work, we've been using CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively and the results bear this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an extremely versatile medicine that
really contributes greatly to therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just feeds into your statement
right before we went to commercial about
[SPEAKER_01]: how big the impact of this can be in
reducing human suffering from anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a big deal, even though you
and I are becoming increasingly
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the attributes or one of the
aspects that I think is worthy of looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at is that so many people presently use
CBD and or THC for their anxiety now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD, CBG, and THC have all three of
them got different modes of operation
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned in the last set,
one of the magical things that not
[SPEAKER_01]: magical, one of the impressive things that
CBG does is decrease anxiety without
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxication, which, as most of us know,
is exactly the mode of operation for why
[SPEAKER_01]: THC works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sedates people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for many people, that handles their
major type of anxiety and it decreases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you please do us the favor of
comparing CBG versus THC for anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: then CBG versus CBD so we can tease out a
little bit more what is unique about CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to these two, which are very
common, commonly used in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is a very strange one in this
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well known that it THC can be helpful
or hurt anxiety, and it's really a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very small doses have an
anti-anxiety effect, whereas higher doses
[SPEAKER_00]: can certainly induce anxiety or even
panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an effect that's been known
for 4,000 years because it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient Assyrian literature in relation to
cannabis, it was said to be for or against
[SPEAKER_00]: panic, and again, a matter of dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the biphasic nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's called a biphasic dose
response with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if CBG induces anxiety, I don't know
what the dose is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know anecdotally that people have taken
very high doses and not had this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the upper limit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, CBG probably is a safer
bet if the target is anxiety, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that there's a dose range that seems
to be effective and without the
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxication that can occur if the THC
dose gets too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about the two together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, in our formulation work,
we're using CBG with low doses of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seemingly it's a really useful adjunct
thing to add that improves clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seem to be these at least
additive or even synergistic benefits on
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, sleep, and mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having CBG aboard may increase what's
called the therapeutic index of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the amount that you can use
without producing side effects and making
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall effect that much greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is that adding CBG to your THC
may relieve some of the negative outcomes
[SPEAKER_01]: of THC and therefore helping THC do its
job while CBG is doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing this where we have
situations of people rating their effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of different chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what the certificates of
analysis tell us about the proportions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to see these patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we're hearing
consistently is when there's a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CBG in the preparation,
along with the THC, that it's much better
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerated, that people have a good
experience or benefit on symptoms without
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-associated side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen some of that anecdotally as
well here on Vashon Island, because since
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBG dominant cultivar has been grown
here on the island for a few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who historically had a strong,
anxious, reaction, dysphoric response to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking cannabis, even if they used
edibles or oils or things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: some folks, just smoking doesn't work for
them because it shoots them up really
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some folks don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People started mixing CBG flour in with
their THC flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those sharp increases in
anxiety were relieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are very small number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, shows the potential for use for
folks who are also needing THC for some
[SPEAKER_01]: other issue that they're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBG can take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have similar comparisons of CBG
versus CBD used for anxiety?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at why people use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mentioned that the survey patients
use CBG to treat pain, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and eight sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often hear the same claims for CBD,
but we have to parse this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about CBD as an isolate,
it actually is alerting at low and
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only at extreme doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this bi-physic dose response that
CBD actually produces any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to anxiety, we know now after
these studies that there's a distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD was studied in an article by Berga
Maske et al in Brazil some years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at social anxiety,
which is akin to what we were doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It required 400 milligrams of CBD isolate
to produce a significant anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the anti-anxiety effect with 20
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a 20-fold difference in dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that it appears that CBG is much
more potent as an anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 milligrams of CBD is going to be quite
expensive, no matter what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, hopefully, with a CBG-only
chemo-var, 20 milligrams is just not that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be much more economical,
and I suspect more effective overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know enough about the mode of
operation of CBD versus CBG to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, based on the size of dose,
it suggests we should move towards CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having used both independently for my
anxiety, I just simply find CBG to be
[SPEAKER_01]: wildly more effective than CBD,
which makes me think that it's doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something different than the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some of this gets into some really
heavy effects on different areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I believe, and we'll need to have
subsequent studies like functional MRI or
[SPEAKER_00]: PET scans to look at this, but this is
likely affecting the limbic system,
[SPEAKER_00]: the emotional areas of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, likely are a lot of distinct
differences, but that's going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: more investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds like a great shaping
fire episode, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you've got that research
done, make sure you let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might be a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I want to point out,
you just compared the 20 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant CBG-dominant tincture to 400
milligrams of CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already talked a little bit on
other times that we have spoken about the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between isolate and whole plant
preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ideas that the paper puts
forward is that one way to tweak the study
[SPEAKER_01]: to look for additional benefits would be
to increase the dosage of the CBG from the
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 milligrams that was delivered up to 25
to 50 milligrams, because some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other science that is being done at this
time is using isolate up to 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, someone who's very much into
whole plant medicine, the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate and whole resin aren't the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And time and time again, we see CBD
isolate, for example, not showing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy as whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you weigh for yourself 20
milligrams of whole plant tincture that
[SPEAKER_01]: was used in your study versus 25 to 50
milligrams of isolate being used in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different study?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me like those would be very
hard to compare those because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: apples and apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why certainly when I'm
reviewing, acting as a peer reviewer on
[SPEAKER_00]: other studies, I want specification on
what's being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we want to see studies
where there actually is a certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis as we provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, where you've got studies
where let's say you're looking at pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a whole bunch of different
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be THC predominant or they
might be type twos with THC and CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: different doses, different modes of
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to parse out what's doing
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come up with generality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cannabis helps with pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But science really demands more
specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I believe that studies of
this type where we have a defined
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation, it's much easier to make
these claims, particularly since we had so
[SPEAKER_00]: many significant ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of citizen scientists
and caregivers like myself, we find
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves running into an issue where the
studies that are being done right now are
[SPEAKER_01]: being used or being done with isolate
because isolate is just a single molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also those studies transition
very easily to pharmaceutical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your research, on the other hand,
I herald because you have the audacity to
[SPEAKER_01]: use the plant as it's grown and using a
whole resin and using it in ways that
[SPEAKER_01]: actual patients, actual humans have been
using it for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can see that since you choose to not
use isolate, you might get some pushback
[SPEAKER_01]: from either people who want to use your
work for pharmaceutical applications or
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who just think that a plant resin is
too wild, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many variables because there's
cannabinoids that don't even show up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the COA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those of us who are into whole plant
medicine, we still hold on that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the future of cannabis medicine is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as somebody, you, who has been a
longtime proponent of the Entourage Effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and whole plant medicine, how do you see
it personally as why you choose to use
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant medicine versus isolate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the number one reason is I believe
in the synergy of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I've been on the other side of
the fence, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the study we just did with
limonene isolate with THC isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you require a deconstruction and
reconstruction to understand what the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see a place for both in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to therapeutics,
I'm firmly in the camp that you want an
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and not an isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to work best on the things
that we're trying to do with real people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ethan, do you have any other summary
or impact that you would like to share
[SPEAKER_01]: before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, going back to the study that we
did, I'd like to run through some key
[SPEAKER_00]: points, if I may.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the first study of
cannabigerol looking at anxiety in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often a race against time to get
these things published before somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabigerol reduced anxiety and stress
in this sort of manufactured setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had asked about the degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another figure that we can utilize
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an average decrease in 0.95
out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 26% reduction in the anxiety and
stress scores that were already low to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what does this mean to
somebody who has a clinical anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't say from this, but you know,
and I know from people that have utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG preparations that they're usually very
pleased with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another point in this study, CBG actually
enhanced verbal memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did that with no significant
impairments, either in memory or motor
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's psychomotor speed and balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what the Druid app looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBG Druid score was lower and
comparable to placebo and baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we saw no evidence that CBG was
intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intoxication and drug effect rates
were under one on a 10 point scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: drug liking remained neutral throughout
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of side effects, negative
drug effect ratings like dry eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid heart rate, dry mouth, those remain
low and did not differ from placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these really indicate that this
seems to be have an extremely benign
[SPEAKER_00]: profile at the same time that it's
producing significant effects on stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, on a real human level,
I can only imagine that you and Dr. Cutler
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty stoked with how this survey
turned out or how the research turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're definitely going on from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have immediate plans for two more
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be similar to this, but done in
the lab, which allows for greater
[SPEAKER_00]: objective measures, you know, measuring
blood pressure, measuring cortisol,
[SPEAKER_00]: a stress hormone, measuring reactions to
pain on a thing called the cold pressor
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be up coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have plans for a clinical
study where CPG preparation would be
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at in terms of an actual disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean like you'll target one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dr. Russo, thank you so much for
