[SPEAKER_00]: A couple times a month, I get emails from
listeners in Prohibition states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always express frustration in
learning of all the cannabis opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: in other states while their own state
continues to live in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart always goes out to these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about you, friends in Idaho,
Utah, South Dakota, Nebraska, Alabama,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Indiana, where I went to college and
slanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel for y'all who live in states
pretending to modernize and yet having
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-only cannabis laws, THC maximums,
or simply broken systems that don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like they will ever be repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, that even includes my own state of
Washington, where we don't even have
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide testing on licensed products or
homegrown yet somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization is a wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly being run by politicians who
don't know cannabis or cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and are more focused on making donors
happy than providing informed leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between intransigent boomer politicians
and aggressive business-focused lobbyists,
[SPEAKER_00]: American cannabis is proudly evolving the
worst of all possible situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this all sucks, but understanding the
dynamics of what is going on is a major
[SPEAKER_00]: key to us getting it all sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is most common for we cannabis
folks to have a toke and mind our own
[SPEAKER_00]: business, there are a handful of cannabis
policy researchers out there who are
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping score, looking at history to see
what has worked and failed in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are coming up with novel ideas that
help us understand what the hell is going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the individuals who are needed
to lead us back to sanity.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Dominic Korva,
PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic Korva is founder and executive
director of the Center for the Study of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and Social Policy based in
Seattle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a sought after speaker on cannabis
policy and travels the world to consult
[SPEAKER_00]: for government and academic bodies on
effective cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also co-director of the Humboldt
Institute of Interdisciplinary Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Research at Humboldt State University,
affiliate professor of sociology at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt State University, and the
cannabis policy specialist for the
[SPEAKER_00]: California Center for Rural Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He received his PhD in geography from the
University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic is also one of my most valued
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Dominic as I was making my
transition from the black market to
[SPEAKER_00]: community organizing medical cannabis
cultivators back in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mentorship, connections and support
have been invaluable to my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forming of the Vimeo organization here
on Vashon Island and my eventual creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is likely true that Shaping Fire would
not exist today if Dominic had not
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged me to pursue helping cannabis
patients and organized cannabis education
[SPEAKER_00]: events all those years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, Dominic Korva holds a special
place in the scene here in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: As is true in most states, the cannabis
scene here is pretty small and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and many of us came from the
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic is someone everyone embraces
because he gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: His depth on cannabis policy is immense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic understands the historic oracle
basis for everything we see happening
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally today and he waves aside the
bro science that constitutes policy
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion in most circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic is a cannabis policy oracle and he
is a big hearted, lovable academic who is
[SPEAKER_00]: embraced by everyone I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are going to discuss the impact
of state licensing on long-term cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in California, the awkwardness of
prohibition and licensed sales existing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time, cannabis prohibition as a
public health issue, the profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: injustice of nonviolent cannabis
prisoners, the latest on electrical usage
[SPEAKER_00]: by industrial agricultural cannabis farms
and the rise of the citizen scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is my third time and it's
always great to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you were the one when I
moved from the gongepreneur.com podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: over here to Shaping Fire on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were my very first guest of the new
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for being back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, congratulations on your new
collection of heavy duty academic research
[SPEAKER_00]: entitled The Routledge Handbook of
Post-Preliminary Prohibition Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what an amazing collection of
research here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and your writing partner,
Joshua Maizel, edited quite a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: tome interpreting the present with a firm
understanding of the past and how we got
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 30 chapters provide a substantial look
into the most well-researched perspectives
[SPEAKER_00]: into these rather complex cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot written about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's such a popular topic in
mainstream media, but we know they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot wrong all the time and it frustrates
us when we read this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are small cannabis media
companies inside of cannabis that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really mainstream who are just slightly
better, but they still get details and
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives wrong all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is simply people with no
background fighting on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variety of research in this new book
is a different variety of any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vigorously researched and these are
top shelf academics looking at these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want people to understand why this
is a different approach than most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they read out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you start us out by explaining how
a collection of academic papers like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is unlike the other examples I gave?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really two things that I define
as part of post-prohibition cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: research as opposed to just cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-prohibition first, let's remember,
is a term that I use to refer to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with, not after prohibition, cannabis
legalization with, not after prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concern as a social scientist and
as a geographer was to collect across five
[SPEAKER_01]: meta-categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Examples of research that did two things,
one of two things and sometimes both of
[SPEAKER_01]: two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those I think people are more
familiar with, which is now that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is legal, we can actually research
positive things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the defining prohibition research
agenda was that really you could only
[SPEAKER_01]: research things or get funding for
research to look at how cannabis was bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the first level and
that's a real accessible one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, A.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilson Poe's opioid substitution chapter
is a really good example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of it is that, you know,
obviously we still have prohibition with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about cannabis legalization often
in a vacuum as though it's just operating
[SPEAKER_01]: and creating these just sort of legal
landscapes when in fact those landscapes
[SPEAKER_01]: are totally entangled with landscapes of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll just give you a couple
of examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most obvious one, I think readers will
get this right away, is federal
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition is still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means a lot of things about what
kind of, you know, legal landscapes we can
[SPEAKER_01]: construct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, for example, you know,
cannabis can't be agriculture in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means a million different things
for land use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a million different things for
other kinds of regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it means a lot for about local
control, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Local control being, you know,
sub-state jurisdictions get to really do
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be another aspect of,
you know, prohibition that continues
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, because as we experienced in
Washington and Colorado a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but certainly in California, it's real
obvious that, you know, about two thirds
[SPEAKER_01]: of the jurisdictions in California,
and that is 56 counties and something like
[SPEAKER_01]: 450 cities, don't allow, you know,
cannabis businesses to operate,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means we have a landscape that is a
patchwork quilt, right, of prohibitions
[SPEAKER_01]: and legal businesses that are operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in the jurisdictions where legal
jurisdictions are operating, legal
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses are operating, we continue to,
of course, have prohibition on some
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Washington State, most famously,
obviously, does not allow homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Washington State, therefore,
you know, legalization with prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: means, yeah, we've got legal cannabis,
but you can't grow it at home without a
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't get a license to grow it at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, the broad concept of,
you know, how legalization is entangled
[SPEAKER_01]: with prohibition, it's really important to
kind of start with that for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research, because then the research agenda
is how do we disentangle prohibition from
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just how do we get legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that even though we're getting
legalization, we also still need to work
[SPEAKER_01]: to disentangle prohibition from it and get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of our authors are really
sharp about this and focused on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that Sunil's chapter in public
health is a very interesting example of a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge to public health as an
institution, as an academic meta
[SPEAKER_01]: institution, where they still have a lot
of those prohibition assumptions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sunil talks about really, like,
they don't recognize the right to
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual health as part of what's on
their agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can't support research that is
about that kind of positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I want to say is that
there's kind of a third degree as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a contextual one, which is to say
that legalization's politics are connected
[SPEAKER_01]: with and entangled with other kinds of
politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, I mean legalization may in
especially, you know, urban areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: be entangled with what might be described
as, you know, especially public safety
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented kind of liberal politics that
gets in the way of the implementation of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think about what about the kids as
kind of that research question that like
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of a liberal prohibition question
because it doesn't ask whose kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, you know, there's a very
interesting entanglement with maybe what
[SPEAKER_01]: are usually thought about as libertarian
and right wing thoughts about the free
[SPEAKER_01]: market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether we should be, you know,
deregulating, especially small businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, which is not traditionally
something that is on a left or liberal
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these things have an effect on
what kind of legalization we get and
[SPEAKER_01]: where.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to think about those
entanglements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're promoting research agenda is that
almost nobody else really are thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the entanglements with prohibition,
the entanglements with other kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty big, broad set of
observations by organizing it in five meta
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So governance, public health, ecology and
the environment, markets and society and
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and social change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are kind of interdisciplinary
clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say academic, academic means a
lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Academia is divided into a lot of silos
that we call disciplines, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the disciplines that really haven't
gotten as much run, I think, with either
[SPEAKER_01]: funding or recognition are the social
science disciplines, which have a long
[SPEAKER_01]: history of critical analyses of
prohibition, which is super important,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really got to draw on that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if we want a legal landscape that
undoes the harms of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we need to draw on observations,
insights and research about prohibition's
[SPEAKER_01]: harms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are found pretty exclusively in
the social sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a really broad array of
folks from different disciplines or from
[SPEAKER_01]: interdisciplinary research clusters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get a little complicated,
but broadly, speaking, I think everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of understands, okay, governance is
like the law, democracy, institutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public health includes biomedical
research, as well as citizen science,
even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ecology and the environment isn't just
about the impacts of outdoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: on water supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about energy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And energy use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets and society include a discussion
of what's so difficult?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it so difficult for people to
actually make money as small businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important question to ask,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So culture and social change also deals
with stigma, ongoing stigma, which I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't talked about, and is one of those
slippery concepts because you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can quantify maybe the effects of
stigma, but you need really qualitative
[SPEAKER_01]: research methods to dig into how is stigma
changing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is continuing to be harmed by stigmas
of prohibition, even in legal landscapes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would point out that often it's
medical patients, as Newhart and Dolphin
[SPEAKER_01]: do in their chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into some of those
specific topics, just for folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in how the compilation came
together, with an ever increasingly pool
[SPEAKER_00]: of talented academics studying and writing
about modern Canvas policy, how did you go
[SPEAKER_00]: about choosing your authors?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've put together a literal dream team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredible cast of folks who are
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you choose the topics first and then
find the authors, or did you choose an
[SPEAKER_00]: author first and then invite them or a
topic or maybe something else entirely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was an iterative process,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to walk you through the
whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us a thumbnail because I'm
looking for any agenda that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the people that you chose,
and then particularly how one pulls
[SPEAKER_00]: together such an incredible group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to go deep into it
because we want to move on to the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: swiftly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically, once we had figured out
the structure that we wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh and I both reached out to academics
in our network.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the first things that we
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we're not new to the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a history of publishing and
working with and following the research of
[SPEAKER_01]: folks as far away as Uruguay and Morocco
and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, it came from our networks
is the simplest answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were people who many of them were
friends of ours already, certainly,
[SPEAKER_01]: and already kind of tuned into what we
wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were like Craig Reineman,
who starts off the book, was Josh's
[SPEAKER_01]: dissertation advisor at UC Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Craig is a luminary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wendy Chapkis is someone that I followed
for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've taught her book and gotten to
know her basically by reaching out to her,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and she's another superstar
in the public health section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there weren't a whole lot of
strangers, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that there were a number of people
we reached out to and they said no,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a number of people we reached
out to and they said, OK, let's try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when what they wanted to write kind of
came back, didn't fit what we want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: for the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of like we either worked with them
to come to an understanding or let them
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these were kind of famous
people and I don't want to bag on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was some other folks that
just kind of let's say Carl Hart was very
[SPEAKER_01]: busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He agreed to write a chapter and then
there were just there was just a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: silence and kind of dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like he was relying on his
graduate students.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just kind of let that go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since his book came out, I can imagine the
demand on his time have skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like this idea that's coming
clear that you and Josh Meisel are area
[SPEAKER_00]: experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have both been doing this,
teaching this at university level for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades on your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how old Josh is, but you guys
are very much area experts and discipline
[SPEAKER_00]: experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two of you just work together and
curated from all of the people they have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you chose the best of the best who
were also interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your introduction, co-written with
Josh, you say that this book is intended
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage critical research agendas
that address the continuity of prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: in legal cannabis frameworks as they
remain entangled with the continuum of
[SPEAKER_00]: global drug production, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar to what you said during your
introduction today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so much to unpack there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what piques my interest in that heavy
duty sentence is that no one country's
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxation of cannabis laws happens in
isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Countries are forever interdependent even
if they think they're doing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I talked about that during episode
one of Shaping Fire when we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: policy transfer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is especially true in regards to
the drug trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please talk to us a bit about how we are
seeing the global global dynamic of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production, distribution and
prohibition shift around as countries
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to embrace cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that sentence actually ended
with global drug prohibition, but
[SPEAKER_01]: production is part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think, for example,
you can look at, you know, the chapter on
[SPEAKER_01]: Morocco by Kenza F.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sahi, where basically they've been
cultivating cannabis for thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, you know, in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market for it certainly has been,
you know, they've produced hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, for Europeans for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only been in the last,
you know, maybe 20 years where basically
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that were bred, you know,
generally by Europeans and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans, were taken to the Moroccan
fields, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which actually starts screwing with their
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a very basic level, of course,
what they had were land races that were
[SPEAKER_01]: adapted their environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were, you know, resistant to
whatever they needed to resist there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with new, you know, genetics
coming in, sometimes bred under conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: of quasi-legality, sometimes not,
but generally speaking, being brought in
[SPEAKER_01]: because they want to feed the market on
the other end with something that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: found that market will prefer,
whether that's Europe or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring in the genetics and it really
screws with the basic agroecology of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Moroccan cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also think about the opening up of
cannabis trade internationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: which hasn't happened to the degree that I
think some people think as, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: being to affect the livelihoods of folks
who've been producing cannabis in other
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right now, legally speaking,
obviously, Colombia has done some
[SPEAKER_01]: exporting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Uruguay has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think both of those have been
through Tilray.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a shift towards kind of the
globalization that we've been familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, around other commodities,
you know, for 30, 40 years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The supply chains that are rely on cheap
labor to produce a low cost product and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to a market that has money that
will pay more money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's sort of a mundane,
you know, problem with globalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, you know, labor gets screwed,
for example, in the first world,
[SPEAKER_01]: the so called first world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also kind of kind of funny
because the drug war did something during
[SPEAKER_01]: the age of globalization, which is kind of
crazy, which is it was anti globalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got domesticated U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The production that we used to import from
Mexico, Thailand, Colombia and elsewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: has been displaced significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, starting about 20 years
ago, pretty close to half of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: consume in this country started being
pretty much grown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of kind of
counterintuitive, you know, explanations
[SPEAKER_01]: for what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those involve applying
critiques of globalism and globalization
[SPEAKER_01]: to critiques of globalizing weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are, well, then where
does, like, you know, global prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: come into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're then you're off down a
rabbit hole.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, in countries that continue to
prohibit cannabis, it is much,
[SPEAKER_01]: much harder for them to attempt to
continue to continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a lot of product being being
moved around the world and in different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have in Peru, you know, cannabis being
grown and processed into BHO, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has a higher price per per weight
than than cocaine, you know, in Lima.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're getting cultivation
practices shifting from just cocaine to
[SPEAKER_01]: coca out in the Amazon area to coca and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, processing into the
refined product that's smaller and easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to smuggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, where does that go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it goes to Lima.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably isn't coming to the United
States because we've had our extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: game, you know, explosion here already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a vast oversupply of,
you know, for example, BHO in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just a few examples of what I
mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that this the patchwork that
you described that we're all aware of in
[SPEAKER_00]: California really plays out the same if
you look at the global presence as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it must really cause a whole bunch of
odd imbalances and contrasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you when when, you know, countries as
a pool are both holding on to traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition that was pushed by the West,
plus now everybody wanting to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, increase health with medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also now this entrepreneurial
approach where people are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: commoditize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of these are happening at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like, you know,
as you know, these market inefficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: must just be dazzling as a social
researcher like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you know, like, I think you're
exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patchwork quilt exists at the local
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It exists at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by local, I mean city and county.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's patchwork quilt upon patchwork
quilt upon patchwork quilt upon patchwork
[SPEAKER_01]: quilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, regionally north of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: America globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'd say that it's almost like
a logarithmically more complex landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: that regulators are faced with because
they're the ones who actually worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: it quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, it provides,
I think, as you know, opportunities for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of entrepreneurial activities that are
different from and scaled differently than
[SPEAKER_01]: we used to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when you throw in the medical
regimes as well, and medical, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: is in there in that gray area of the
entanglement between prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have the full throated
embrace of CBD, for example, like
[SPEAKER_01]: globally, very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And global supply chains for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, in countries that are also
pretty into prohibition, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely driving CBD production and so
forth, like China.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's remember that even though the US has
probably originated and pushed this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are definitely other
significant geopolitical entities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging on to prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will probably hang on longer than
the US will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the Philippines, which is an
absolute war crime situation going on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that to me says, like, there is so
much opportunity for research and research
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually shows how complex and
difficult this is when you're stacking
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations on top of regulations that,
you know, may seem to work locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when you zoom out a little bit,
you have your Oklahoma, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, you know, headed in a different
direction than your California and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and Oregon situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that, you know, Oklahoma is a
place where a lot of people went and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, become entrepreneurs that then
they can, they're not just selling it
[SPEAKER_01]: locally, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The same as the West Coast, you know,
even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for Washington, maybe it was eight
years ago, Oregon still exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like Oklahoma has become an export,
like a THC exporting state, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your work and what we've been talking
about so far, you've been talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: teasing apart prohibition and legalization
because somehow they're both existing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to look at an example from
Northern California where cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators went from working in the
medical, gray and export markets during
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition to a new kind of prohibition
that's actually being pushed by licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies trying to protect their
markets from unlicensed producers to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point that, you know, folks are,
you know, licensed producers are suing the
[SPEAKER_00]: state for not stomping out their
competitors in the unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, growing cannabis and minding
your own business is still experienced as
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition as law enforcement showing up
with, you know, woodchippers and to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy family crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it even fair to call what we are seeing
today as legalization or are we just using
[SPEAKER_00]: that word because it's the closest thing
that we've got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you have to define the term
and define how you're using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we define it very, very clearly in the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization is the licensing and
regulation of a supply chain from seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: clone to consumer, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have that, you've got a form of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's do you have a carved out space,
whether or not you still prohibit it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in other ways where cannabis can
travel entirely under circumstances that
[SPEAKER_01]: are regulated and supposedly tracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got this, by the way, from Harry
Levine, in particular, who defined it
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago with respect to Amsterdam back
in 2004, which Amsterdam, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't actually have legalization either.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supply side of it wasn't regulated and
the consumption side of it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Levine had begun to think about,
well, what is legalization at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's to me, you know,
it is is the carving out of these supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chains that are governed or at least
supposed to be governed from the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: to the end use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually let's let's blow our
readers minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been happening since the 1970s in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the University of Mississippi and the
investigative new drug program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a great legal supply chain of
federally legal cannabis that went from
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Mississippi to medical
patients like LV Musica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert Randall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was entirely legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had legalization in the United
States since the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's be real clear about that at
the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that's still there's still
a couple of patients still in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you think about that, then you
don't think, well, legalization is not
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a brand new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's existed before, but we didn't
recognize it because prohibition was sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of an overwhelming fact, total fact,
total social fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like to make sure that we're
defining legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an issue in the media and
with a lot of other like policy scholars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just assume legalization is its own
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it leads them to, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: research agendas that are that often just
kind of reproduce common sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest, instead of instead of
actually anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the with this very specific
definition of legalization, it actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: a very small niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the word legalization does not say
very much about the overall landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really only speaks to a very small
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the, you know, cannabis legalization,
how it's used casually.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me just jump in real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's absolutely the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the one of the ways this
happens over and over and over again are
[SPEAKER_01]: those maps of the United States that are
color coded for legal state and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CBD only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and well, usually there's there's like
a legal medical and neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like, OK, oh, California and
all these these states are entirely green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as but actually, if you broke that
up by jurisdictions, California would look
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more like a patchwork quilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people just kind of assume,
oh, there's freedom there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it's just a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your thoughts on the rural
militarization of law enforcement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you and I have talked
before both on this show and personally
[SPEAKER_00]: about just the the general militarization
of law enforcement everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, almost daily we're seeing
clips on social media of heavily armed
[SPEAKER_00]: officers and military transports just
tearing through the unpaved roads of
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can this not be seen as simply an
extension of the campaign against
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana planting camp of the 90s and
early 2000s?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's like, yeah, legalization
exists, meaning that there's this there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this path for the for the growing and
distribution of taxed, licensed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you know,
people who, you know, heritage growers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are in California, their situation has not
changed all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me address that, because it's
actually a really great question for for
[SPEAKER_01]: saying something for for a while here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'll indulge me, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of that is it reminds me of your
earlier comments about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: legal businesses, you know, suing the
state for not enforcing against
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and let me say there's a geography to
that and is particularly in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they usually mean are actually,
you know, storefronts, retail storefronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so often, really, the cases in
Southern California, the places that are
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively high density with legal retail,
what they are trying to get people to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is enforce against, you know, unlicensed
storefronts that pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that is a can of worms
itself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those unlicensed storefronts are
generally speaking, demographically
[SPEAKER_01]: underrepresented populations in the legal
landscape, because it's white rich people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been able to get these other
types of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, eradication is the is the rural
version of urban enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what people don't necessarily
understand is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Humboldt and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backed off from being, you know,
I think Gung Ho participants in in
[SPEAKER_01]: Campbell, they continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an informal regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pattern going on, which is to say that law
enforcement would stay out of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they would have, you know,
maybe they would, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a size and a scope of operations
that were more or less just kind of left
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they weren't hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about rural law
enforcement and rural law enforcement is
[SPEAKER_01]: not really out there to bug the sparsely
populated folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have neighbors complaining
because it was all remote areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get left alone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, of course, you know,
camp would come around by the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, as time went on
with camp, they started focusing more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more on on larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Operations that sometimes were
environmentally destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, this was definitely
evident, you know, when I first got to
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, a lot of those old timers and
small cannabis growers that since 96 have
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, not that afraid,
but especially like after 2001,
[SPEAKER_01]: like not too worried about their small
gardens were absolutely up in arms about
[SPEAKER_01]: what they called the greed growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And large scale, environmentally
destructive cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, whenever policing that
was maybe intended for that would catch up
[SPEAKER_01]: a heritage farmer in its net, which,
you know, is almost inevitable,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the collateral damage of,
you know, focusing on larger scale
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old timers would be totally
against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also were kind of interested in,
you know, like they didn't want the large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, environmentally impactful
cultivation in their backyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't just because it was
environmentally impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also driving down the price of
their cannabis because they were flooding
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the enforcement situation today is
absolutely the continuation of camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to remember that camp
changed over time and often in direct
[SPEAKER_01]: directions that I think, you know,
heritage farmers had no problem with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, cheered on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of that is happening
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, the smaller farmers are being
hit by code enforcement more than by
[SPEAKER_01]: eradication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like their issues are now with civil code
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean like the satellites being used
to see greenhouses that are not supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just start hitting them with
fines before they even bother sending in
[SPEAKER_00]: SWAT teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that certainly, I think, is,
you know, the satellites really changed
[SPEAKER_00]: that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The satellites did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty expensive program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino is next up for one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like there's a 1991 article by Joe
Leeper in like the Humboldt Geographic
[SPEAKER_01]: with a map that like has a pretty damn
detailed depiction of where and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants are in the entire county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, there's a way in which
actually, like, they've always been seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is whether they're left alone
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to what use, like, where does that
information go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it used to go to law enforcement,
but now it goes also to code enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And code enforcement is you know,
it is a part of civil government that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not always, you know,
connected to the broader, maybe county
[SPEAKER_01]: vision of trying to protect its citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: By its nature, code enforcement is out
there to weed out the wrong types,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people you don't want in your
neighborhood, the people with their,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe there's abandoned cars on
their property, you know, maybe their
[SPEAKER_01]: house isn't up to code.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, code enforcement is really a
form of law enforcement against poor
[SPEAKER_01]: people, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is kind of different in rural
areas than it is in urban areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's been real significant across the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have Sonoma County,
let's say, right, which largely
[SPEAKER_01]: accommodated medical cannabis and
commercial medical cannabis at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2013, you know, doing a joint task
force, you know, raid on mostly Hispanic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, neighborhood called Roseland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 33 houses, you know, and you look at
what they got and it only ended up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: under three pounds a house and under it's
about $600.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, both of which were not really,
you know, an issue for the white people,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were being left alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have the city of Clear Lake,
which actually at the onset of the
[SPEAKER_01]: financial crisis in 2007, defunded code
enforcement entirely because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for like six years, you know,
they didn't have code enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Clear Lake is a very, very,
very poor town.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's demographically more in common
with like a city in the Appalachians,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to the east than it is the,
you know, state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened was like, you know,
city of 10,000, you know, probably half of
[SPEAKER_01]: the houses had backyards full of cannabis
being cultivated basically right out there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they once they recovered from their
budget recovered in 2014, they reactivated
[SPEAKER_01]: code enforcement specifically to deal with
their so-called problem, the backyard
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation problem, which
certainly had some negative effects and
[SPEAKER_01]: had negative effects associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's, you know, let's say that
ripoffs are a pretty good example of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something bad that can happen
when cannabis is being grown entirely out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the open under conditions of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have valuable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right there for the taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff gets violent fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stuff gets violent fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the landscape now is certainly,
yes, you know, camp is, is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Campus is and not just camp, but local
joint task forces as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on where you are,
they may be concentrating on large
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally impactful, you know,
cultivation sites that, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: politically, you know, probably more
agreeable to a lot of legacy cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also, you know, catching up
certainly and causing collateral damage
[SPEAKER_01]: for smaller farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's complex, but it was always
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess is the short summary of this long
answer is that yes, it's like camp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but camp isn't necessarily something that
was the same like the eighties and
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties were really it's, it's,
it's gung-ho, you know, hit the small
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, political, you know,
thing there's a, there's a sense in which
[SPEAKER_01]: camp kind of professionalized a little bit
over time and, and also justified funding
[SPEAKER_01]: by getting plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't as incentivized to go
after smaller growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whether it was a moral
decision or not, it became, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more profitable for them to go after a
very large scale cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me re-introduce you before we go to
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis researcher,

to be believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you

[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is cannabis researcher, Dr. Dominic
[SPEAKER_00]: Korva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, chapter four of the book you
edited with Josh Meisel begins with a
[SPEAKER_00]: provocative quote from Oregon State
Representative Diane Russell, who said
[SPEAKER_00]: that the conversation about who makes the
profits off this industry is irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said this is a way to try to focus
activists on getting any legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: passed in the state of Maine rather than
nitpicking the particular policy choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've all seen in California,
Prop 64 was immediately a slippery piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of legislation that quickly became
weaponized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the removal of the one acre
cap that was promised, the entire market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tilted towards large industrial
producers distributing mediocre cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and driving prices down to a point where
the heritage market has just been
[SPEAKER_00]: decimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this happening in one way or
another in nearly every state that is
northern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been normalized so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see these multi-state operators
weave their brands across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: state by state, the future looks very
exasperating for smaller heritage players.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on who is making
profits now and into the future versus how
[SPEAKER_00]: these laws were originally sold to the
public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the public didn't care,
to be honest, who it was that was
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying the cannabis to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly not the part of the public
that needed to be convinced about
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks who just wanted easier
access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think access historically has been
culturally determined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your friend that is into cannabis and
maybe comes from a place where it's around
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's your friend that's a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been difficult for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a Seattle journalist years ago,
happy that he could just go to a store
[SPEAKER_01]: because his dealer was so unreliable
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's just say that the people
voting for legalization, or at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: voting block that mattered, definitely
were not the cannabis culture people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very, very tiny percentage
of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, they were going to vote for
legalization wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I don't think that
legalization was sold originally as an
[SPEAKER_01]: economic justice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That conversation has shifted tremendously
in the last eight years, and primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the Black Lives Matter movement
and the way that that particular social
[SPEAKER_01]: movement has highlighted the whiteness and
richness essentially of ownership in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what that actually means.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you refer to multi-state operators,
we're usually talking about operators who
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting their funding from being
listed on the Canadian stock exchange,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who's making money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, none of those MSOs are actually
making money or very, very few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're doing is losing money until
their competitors can go out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a tried and true method in the
United States that especially developed
[SPEAKER_01]: since Silicon Valley and the tech sector,
that all you had to do was scale up and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't matter if you lost money,
you could always go back to the stock
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange and raise more money until
basically you could go into the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how much many tech
companies lost money or are even
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to lose money today,
whose CEOs and founders are making tens of
[SPEAKER_01]: millions, hundreds of millions of dollars
while they do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the companies aren't making money,
but the CEOs and the founders and their
[SPEAKER_01]: officers are making money because they're
being paid like corporate America.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you pay a CEO in the United
States?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, usually it's something absolutely
ridiculous because that's what essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: early 21st century financialized
capitalism has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's created enormous inequality in terms
of income and the people who are sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: at the bottleneck just extracting what
would be an enormous amount of money to
[SPEAKER_01]: any other individual while their company
loses money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people getting rich and they
tend to be white and they tend to be male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the cannabis industry, the media
part of it really has fallen down about
[SPEAKER_01]: this because so many people want to talk
about how much money is being made,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much revenue is being made in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, like that's a stupid
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money is being made in cannabis
means nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you balance it with, well, how much is
it costing us to actually make that money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where you end up with net
revenue losses, even though you're raking
[SPEAKER_01]: in millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just means you've got a lot of sales,
but you had to spend money to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately, it's the large MSOs
that can lose money, but while small
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses can absolutely not do that,
they will go out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get acquired.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's probably the strategy of a
lot of folks who actually did transition
[SPEAKER_01]: to legalization at this point,
is they've been barely getting by or not
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're positioning their businesses
to get acquired so they can get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: this because they didn't sign up for
basically a business model that was
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely no fun and had absolutely no
reward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really most of them got into
cannabis to get out of the rat race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so legalization puts them right back
in the rat race and nobody wants to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: rat racing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an interesting question across
the landscape, but it's that popular
[SPEAKER_01]: assumption that anybody who starts a
cannabis business must be loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's entirely because of all the IPO
pumping that's been going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The media really is all about celebrating
how much revenue comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have absolutely no, on the other
hand, these are the costs of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: business and we don't get to deduct them
when we pay our taxes because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an issue in a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say that it gets real messy when
you start talking about a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: equity programs that are oriented towards
diversifying ownership in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because being an owner in the cannabis
industry is not the reward for someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: is not a corporation that you would
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an invitation to go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we both have this problem that yes,
too many white people are owners,
[SPEAKER_01]: but especially too many white people are
CEOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these large companies and too many
companies are in fact, just these giant
[SPEAKER_01]: financial conglomerations that are,
you know, just whales trying to swallow
[SPEAKER_01]: all the smaller whales until they're the
biggest whale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that problem is almost entirely
produced by the, you know, levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation that are required that you can
lose a bunch of money and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pay those costs of regulation
and upkeep and unpredictability building
[SPEAKER_01]: in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have access to essentially a,
you know, a revenue source that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a public stock exchange,
you just sell more shares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the shareholders themselves also,
you know, have essentially bought little
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of something that they hope will
eventually become big pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they themselves may eventually,
you know, cash out too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's acknowledge that shareholders are
also part of this landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the demographic of the
shareholders, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there should be more research on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be an important thing
to uncover really is how financialized is
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry and what are the
demographics of that financialization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who really is making a bunch of money
and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the answer is, well, they're
making a bunch of money because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing exactly what capitalism in the
United States and elsewhere, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivizes them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, well, how do we
change this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if the problem is actually existing
capital capitalism, then maybe the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be, you're going to do
something about capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me actually break that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as vague by capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me refer to, you know, the
financialized sector of our GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us separate out the capitalism of
small businesses and entrepreneurs and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and livelihood operators who are also,
if you, you know, depending on how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: defining capitalism is for example,
you know, using wage labor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're practicing capitalism,
but they aren't practicing the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalism that operates your stock
exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have these regulations,
the regulations work just fine for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're, they're a small barrier
for a financialized company relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of barrier they are for small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't want to be like me and,
and, you know, throw all of capitalism
[SPEAKER_01]: under, under a bus, you know, it'd be good
to kind of think about this in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what do regulations do in terms of
you know, business competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: business competition and ownership
considerations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the rest of the United States,
what it does is it concentrates ownership
[SPEAKER_01]: in the hands of the few and, and wrecks
small businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, heavy regulations are very
difficult for small business owners to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with, but they are not really much
of a barrier for highly capitalized
[SPEAKER_01]: interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this kind of ambivalent thing
going on here is we need big regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: for big business and small regulations for
small business is probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible way to think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we really aren't set up in
the society to, to think that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are set up to think, oh, there's either
regulations or no regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, if you want to democratize
the economy and maybe do a little work on
[SPEAKER_01]: economic justice, what you would do is
have big regulations for big business and
[SPEAKER_01]: small regulations for small business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tease out one particular
demographic that, that you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a big setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you were just telling us about how
the these, these large cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are creating a lot of revenue,
but not actually necessarily profit
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're spending so much money,
but they are paying their executive suite
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, they are able to take on more
and more debt by selling at a profit until
[SPEAKER_00]: the, their competition, including smaller
financialized companies and the entirety
[SPEAKER_00]: of the craft artisan market, you know,
the heritage folks, until they are all
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, crushed and go out of
business, or as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: get picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see some of the
heritage brands that have been successful
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to ally with some of these
distributors, you know, potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a, you know, a future buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we'll see how that goes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in the vast majority
of heritage growers who are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: buckling under the weight of the low
prices and the fact that they are not,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the same efficiencies of
scale that some of these industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural cannabis producers have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when their backs are finally
broken in the licensed system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're all like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not playing in the licensed system
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to interrupt you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you've gone really staticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's figure out what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me figure out where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at, time-wise, 5836.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did it change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was I couldn't hear your
entire question because you were going in
[SPEAKER_01]: and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it staticky now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the last sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no stat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe what I did, let's try something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me turn my head this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what was happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you now hear me less well?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're just kind of quiet now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it was literally staticky,
you'd go in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess I will, let's, I guess we
can just blame that on the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might have been a burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sounding good now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe just start that question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start that question from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be a moment for me to edit
into and I'll restart the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one group in that demographic that
I really would like to tease out and be
[SPEAKER_00]: patient with me because this question
takes a moment to set up because you
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed out how the large-cap cannabis
corporations are financialized and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of revenue coming in,
but they're actually losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're okay with that because their
goal is, like you said, to be a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: whale and buy out the smaller whales and
then the much smaller people just run them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of business to the point that prices
are so low for cannabis that there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of a premium market left for the
smaller artisan craft producers that I
[SPEAKER_00]: herald on this show all the time,
the heritage growers who have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a certain point
where this substantial number of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are no longer able to see financial
benefit in the licensed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're like, all right,
fine, we're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we already know, a lot of these
craft companies have got two businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the licensed one that they're
hoping to participate in and they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: second one that's still exporting and
helping pay the bills while the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: business gets up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's enough strength,
in corporate cannabis, they're never going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually they'll just have to choose
to give up their license and air quotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: go do something else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the craft growers that I know who
have grown up in cannabis, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing is all they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder what that looks like from a
sociological perspective which you offer
[SPEAKER_00]: about these people who grew up in illegal
cannabis and then took a shot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed market and became publicly known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the public market was so broken and
monopolized by financialized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that they have to go do
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect their first choice would be
to go back to the unlicensed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has now grossly changed both in
California and in the market that they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to, and still do to a certain degree,
export to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think, from your
perspective, seeing the grand landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to happen to this particular
pool of heritage growers who eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: give up and say, I can't do this in the
licensed market?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, or what have you seen
these folks starting to do when the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market has so changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's acknowledge from the GECO
that probably 95% of them never made a go
[SPEAKER_01]: of the licensed market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it was such a large share
of the unlicensed market that never even
[SPEAKER_00]: tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an impressive number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm pulling that number a little
out of my butt, but it's also a matter of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you look at Humboldt that had an
estimated to say 15,000 cultivators on the
[SPEAKER_01]: eve of legalization, and they have 800
distinct owners of cultivation or other
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of licenses right now that are going
through the permitting and licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that right there is 90%, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Humboldt, you know, had a very high
concentration, also has a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very large amount of licenses per capita,
way more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Mendocino, certainly,
similarly, you're already actually seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: in Mendocino and elsewhere, the revenue
reports of the last year of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these people that had permits and were
operating but are not reporting revenue
[SPEAKER_01]: this year and don't appear to be
operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already going through an
extinction event in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's kind of two things to think
about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, you know, returning to the
unregulated markets or participating in it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way to try to stay in place and not
become displaced from their communities,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding something else to do in terms of
an occupation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also displacement, you know,
like, definitely a lot of people went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma lately, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all, you know, different
outcomes, you know, staying in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your name is already in the system,
your property is already in the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you cease to be a licensed or
permitted operator, stop reporting
[SPEAKER_01]: revenues, you're stuck your neck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the odds that you're going to be
able to stay there and do the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, they're looking for you
and they're wondering what happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's important to realize
that a lot of operators, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's many different kinds of heritage
farmers is the thing I'm struggling with
[SPEAKER_01]: here, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them have been, you know,
at the cutting edge of indoor and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, breeding and staying on top of
the latest cultivars and regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's, you know, a lot of folks
that, you know, were not, they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they were growing and they had
places to send it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adapting, I think, to new things,
especially, you know, staying on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is you can export, because it's
not just anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that adapting in terms
of what it is you're growing and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing it are two big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly reducing your inputs and
staying, you know, low impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean that environmentally as well as
socially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand under the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are all adaptive
strategies that people are using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that also within the
licensed market, the problem isn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: the MSOs over producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that California cannot open
enough retail that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, two thirds of its jurisdictions,
you know, don't have retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that means is that there is
more and more product going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the amount of stores that is
staying completely, you know, the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that drives down the cost of or the
price of wholesale cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually a little bit drives down
the price of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what's also happening is,
you know, distributors distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses are operated as burners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have these entrepreneurs who
basically acquire distribution licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy up tons of product, and then report it
all lost or stolen, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, yeah, your price on your
wholesale price that you can buy on the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal side is like down to very,
very little here, four or 500,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can turn around and export
that somewhere else for three times as
[SPEAKER_01]: much, you know, per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's when I think we talked
about this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when basically the legal market
becomes the diversion market, the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversion market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of interplay between the
unregulated and regulated, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: diversion and not diversion dynamic is
homeostatic in a certain way, because now
[SPEAKER_01]: the unregulated market gets flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drives the price down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody going to the unregulated market
and hoping that's what saves them is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get chased by this flood of,
you know, diversion coming from the
[SPEAKER_01]: license market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a dynamic that's not just like
what's happening this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what's happening next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is all very difficult,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I will say, though, is that
obviously, you know, there's no logical
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why farmers shouldn't have direct
to market access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why did they have to go through
distributors and retailers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they sell directly to consumers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if they got that right,
as any other farmer or agricultural sector
[SPEAKER_01]: has, you know, you can sell your apples,
you know, on a farm stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you don't get arrested for
that, you know, like that would help,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the other part is like,
if you are producing the absolute top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the line craft stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your market share isn't falling
because basically those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate cannabis at large scale can't
produce quality that is high enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: attract the sophisticated consumer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the specific consumers barely even
patronizing the legal market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is, you know, like,
I remember in 1993, 94, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my stoner buddies, you know, come into a
party and they're like, we got the kind,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, like, and I was like,
how much did you pay for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like $400 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh my God, because like
what we were buying was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred dollar ounces of Mexican seeded
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I didn't have any,
I didn't know, you know, why a poor
[SPEAKER_01]: college student would choose to like,
you know, purchase a much more expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know, until you consume it
and you see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're ruined forever from Mexican
brickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact is, is that like,
you know, over the course, the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1990s and 2000s, like people literally
chose to spend four times more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on the, on the, on the consumer
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they have that they could have
bought the Mexican, but our entire
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic market shifted towards the more
expensive stuff because it was that much
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, again, there, there is like
craft, actual crafts, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: production, which not everyone every
heritage growers has the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily to do, you know, it will have
shelf space at prices that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, much more agreeable to the
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to actually hone your craft in
addition to, you know, embracing new
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing possibilities like Appalachians
and, you know, equity branded supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chains and local branded supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many other marketing tricks that
you can do to kind of stay in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is, if you can't pay your
rent, you're not going to be, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go forward with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are, those are kind of the
options available is to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace all of the things that you can do
to add value to your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, you know, usually that
means smaller scale cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's how you get really high
quality product, not mass produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you can do that,
you know, if you're a heritage farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's rural on your land,
you know, like, that was the point you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing this to stay on your land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can grow, you know, organic food
and vegetables as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and mix it up, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heritage farmers that are, you know,
historically, maybe more urban or indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is it going to, is it paying the
rent or is it not, you know, like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the question, you know, and if it's not,
and if you don't have access to market,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're going to be displaced
basically, or, or, or, or you're going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to get a different
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say that, you know, a lot of
those, those folks, a lot of those folks
[SPEAKER_01]: actually developed trade skills that are
pretty vital to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like indoor production that are not bad
options, you know, going back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: going back into real estate, going into,
you know, HVAC or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: electric or whatever else, you know,
those are options basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a lot of the rest of the gig
economy, it's kind of cobbling stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: together to, to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's always been a
difference though, between the folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing it to like, stay out of the rat
race and the people who were doing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically cheat in the rat rat race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got no moral judgment actually about
the latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say as well, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, screw the rat race,
you know, anybody who's trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: around it is I totally understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, like I think that's the
right to not be displaced from one's
[SPEAKER_01]: community and land is a really important
principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that I think we should
be, we may be able to do something about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly the state of California is
increasingly, maybe it's too little too
[SPEAKER_01]: late, but you know, the equity program
monies are arriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another million dollars that
Humboldt County has taken out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: general fund to help their farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just announced like a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, jurisdictions who are collecting
a, you know, a bunch of taxes that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting their local businesses are
going to lose those taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to start, you know,
saying, okay, well maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we'll, you know, beef up our equity
programs, try to keep people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but the ones that do that are usually
the ones that recognize people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: part of their communities, their mothers,
fathers, sisters, brothers and daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're not trying to make
a move to Oklahoma, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so for the rest of this set,
let's, let's take a, let's pivot and move
[SPEAKER_00]: from more the governance and cultural
disciplines into public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, nearly everyone knows
somebody who's being helped by medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in states that don't have any sort of
medical or, you know, rec cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they still have their sister who lives in
California or their uncle who lives in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and these people are saying,
oh my gosh, I'm using this and my
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritis is so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so people are aware of medical
cannabis use now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very quickly tearing down the
taboos and moral panic that, as you refer
[SPEAKER_00]: to it in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it has now shown this interesting
contrast between public health and public
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because public policy on especially the
local level because of the patchwork
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local level public policy can be
anti-cannabis and be decreasing access or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or for example, not having pesticide tests
because the businesses are resisting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus the public health drive for
cannabis because people are finding unique
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to get relief from cannabis that
doesn't have some of the same side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: as some of their other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what are you seeing, you know,
from, from your 10,000 foot view of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, this contrast, this friction that
we're getting now between public health
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and kind of antiquated policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that as usual, I'm going to
point towards complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that often, you know,
public health institutions are actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, feeding back on, you know,
prohibition of stigma and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything they can to actually,
you know, keep prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization entangled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, an example of that would
be the ways in which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really strict zoning in terms of like
setbacks in particular from parks and
[SPEAKER_01]: schools and so forth that are way more
harsh than alcohol, you know, are
[SPEAKER_01]: supported by, you know, usually public
health, you know, professionals who are
[SPEAKER_01]: all very, very, very worried about the
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it's, it's usually the white
kids ultimately that they're worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's just say that they're not
necessarily, you know, opposing each other
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, you know, in terms of health
research, more broadly speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it is pretty important for,
you know, bioscientific research to do its
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I want to give a plug to
the person you last had on, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Miyabi Shields, man, like that's
pretty much like both of those interviews,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just say, you know, are an answer
to that, your question, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, this is someone who is
talking about the science of it as
[SPEAKER_01]: something that can be complementary to the
herbal medicine and traditional medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just, you know, another
hierarchical situation where the pursuit
[SPEAKER_01]: for molecular, you know, double-blind
controlled studies, you know, runs herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine out of town, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The burns, the witches at the stake,
which is, I think, a situation that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem for public health, but can be
complementary and synergistic with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that she had some really
sophisticated answers when talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the cultural value of
trusting, you know, the experts in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, bioscience and this humility
with respect to like what we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: know, which is, you know, not much yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think she, they, sorry,
my apologies for the misgendering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pointed towards, you know,
really being at the very beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery about, you know, the
endocannabinoid system and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is often not the attitude of
researchers getting big grants because
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't say that and their grant
applications are not going to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this culture, I think,
that is attached entirely to funding that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, promotes this hierarchical
dismissive approach to health that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, only worried about danger and is
not humble about what it actually knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to a, you know, health research
agenda driven by, you know, bioscientists
[SPEAKER_01]: like Miyabi who are listening to,
you know, what patients are saying about
[SPEAKER_01]: their own bodies and respecting that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean by a more
non-hierarchical approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That expertise is developed, you know,
with patients, not in spite of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that in addition to this
non-hierarchical approach, this contrast
[SPEAKER_00]: that I recognize that you're saying is
very complex, it's also complex in other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the limitations on scientific
research still, that even though we know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a great need for more research
into the medicine, well, it's still really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get them approved using these
controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or another, as we've seen play out
recently in the Olympics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulation in sports, making criminals
out of athletes who are just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be culture-wide friction
between the public health benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and the kind of hangover of moral
panic that drove prohibition for the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, you know, health research has been
a part of the moral panic historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been maybe the main driver of it
because NIDA, you know, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: was funding research for, you know,
40 years on how harmful cannabis could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, you know, the Olympics
example is a really interesting one,
[SPEAKER_01]: as is the general field of exercise and
sport that Dr. Whitney Ogle talks about in
[SPEAKER_01]: her chapter on public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, when Whitney went back
to do essentially a literature review,
[SPEAKER_01]: what she found was in the 1960s and 1970s,
there were actually all these,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginnings of a body of research that
was about the potential public health
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of cannabis in exercise and
sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely vanished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that like, when you're starting
a paper now and you're reviewing the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature, like, there's not much from
the last 10 years, but there's a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: from the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like a thread to pick up
really, and that got just completely
[SPEAKER_01]: obliterated and dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in exercise and sport, obviously,
when it comes to the Olympics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what the scandal about,
you know, Sha'Carri Richardson being
[SPEAKER_01]: disqualified from the Olympics had more to
do with like a public, like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, people being
flabbergasted, people being flabbergasted
[SPEAKER_01]: than any sort of like, oh, this is like a
new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, Ross Robaglio,
the Olympic snowboarder, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years ago, lost his medal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody said, okay, let's change the
rules, therefore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now, like, this literally is,
okay, wait a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is a really weird thing that we
have disqualified a world class athlete
[SPEAKER_01]: for using cannabis, because we have listed
it as a performance enhancing drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how you ban things from
our, you know, from athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like backing into the regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely, completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that things will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, here's the question for you,
Shango, like, is cannabis a performance
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing drug?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of a next level
question that, you know, I would argue not
[SPEAKER_01]: to the level where, you know, should be
banned, like steroids or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might help you recover faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, world class athletes that use
cannabis, including like NBA players,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, at least half of them,
apparently, you know, is that giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: an edge?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a research question,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't start from the point of it's
already banned and then ask that research
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say this doesn't make sense on the
surface and it wasn't in here for any
[SPEAKER_01]: particular research reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no research that said this is
performance enhancing drug, therefore
[SPEAKER_01]: let's ban it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research was like, is it illegal,
therefore let's ban it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, that's, you know, I think a very
interesting research agenda, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: Whitney's as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, how can cannabis be
integrated into, you know, exercise and
[SPEAKER_01]: sport in a healthy way?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a legitimate question,
but, you know, I think there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a research agenda there
about whether cannabis can be performance
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancing that shouldn't be connected to
an already existing rule that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bans people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're going to argue that,
yeah, cannabis can be used, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're exercising, then you have to
embrace that as a legitimate research
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Dominic Korva.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_00]: their own and Night Owl Seeds works
tirelessly, bringing you auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are reliable, thriving,
and with extraordinary terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl Seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Night Owl Seeds really are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos and by fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof is there and obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are complex and rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics,
like I am, you'll likely also love Night
[SPEAKER_00]: Owl Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl founder Daz worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_00]: years, including breeding Mephisto's much
loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing both Night Owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Night Owl Seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs, and desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl even has the Secret Owl Society
Text Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just text the word Night Owl, one word,
to 760-670-3130 for early announcements
[SPEAKER_00]: and exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about upcoming drops by following
[SPEAKER_00]: the Night Owl Seeds Instagram too at Daz
.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-A-Z.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your packs of Night Owl Seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and Hembrah
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Night Owl Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my own garden, insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and always gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Neumann Nelson
and her team are focused on improving your
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your body, go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line, give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is cannabis researcher Dr. Dominic
[SPEAKER_00]: Korva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dominic, I've got another point I want
to bring up about public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the book, prisons come up
again and again as an enforcement tool
[SPEAKER_00]: that is applied unevenly, both by,
well, I guess it's more by locale,
[SPEAKER_00]: by race, and who the judge may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just the roll of the dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of Americans who remain in
prison, you know, props up a for-profit
[SPEAKER_00]: prison system that is, of course,
severely broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we see the strange inequity of
prisoners continuing to be held while
[SPEAKER_00]: white-collar entrepreneurs receive
licenses to sell the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does that strike most folks as
wildly unfair, prison for nonviolent
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis offenses continues to break up
families and have extensive impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, would you continue with an explanation
of what you see happening now along the
[SPEAKER_00]: prison and public health axis during this,
you know, difficult and rocky transition
[SPEAKER_00]: between prohibition and prohibition
alongside licensed and taxed cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing that I want to point
out is that, for example, in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization came with new criminal
penalties for people under the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that this is often a knee-jerk part of
legalization is to actually increase
[SPEAKER_01]: penalties, criminal penalties for,
you know, folks under the age of 21,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, absolutely
counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that has to do with kind
of like deciding an age at which cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is legal, which is also part of the
entanglement of legalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, because like, as far as I
know, we will never be done with
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, you know, criminal
prohibition sanctions against people under
[SPEAKER_01]: the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, perhaps these may get reduced to like
civil ones, but as long as we have
[SPEAKER_01]: basically decided that a legal consumer is
only someone over the age of 21 or someone
[SPEAKER_01]: with a medical, you know, authorization
that's under 21, then we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, a criminal justice system
that tilts against younger people in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as we pointed out before,
demographically, the legal licenses are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, you know, whiter, wealthier
people, and they sometimes have an
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive to call for more enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enforcement happens against black
and brown people, disproportionately.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is especially true in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the phenomenon we call mass
incarceration is a combination of federal
[SPEAKER_01]: and local, you know, prison systems,
basically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sometimes have something to do with
each other and sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_01]: In large urban cities like Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago, in the 1990s and 2000s,
[SPEAKER_01]: what those cities chose to do in terms of
policing and public safety was to do
[SPEAKER_01]: broken windows policing, what they call
broken windows policing, which meant that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically the police had kind of a free
hand to identify, you know, the metaphoric
[SPEAKER_01]: broken windows, signs of disorder in any
given community, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with ways to, you know,
bring them into the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, usually a broken
window in a white community is a black
[SPEAKER_01]: person, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a sign of disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in urban areas in particular,
that kind of policy combined with that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of discretion really intensified the,
you know, bringing black and brown people
[SPEAKER_01]: into the criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also true in rural areas,
but the disproportionality is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That black and brown people in rural areas
definitely are disproportionately,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you look at the numbers, arrested for
cannabis and other drug crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is, it is drastically lower than
in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, there are like arrests
rates are often higher than urban areas
[SPEAKER_01]: per capita, which means that they are
arresting a lot more white people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And women, actually, rural areas often
have higher than state average arrests of
[SPEAKER_01]: women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in particular, let me say,
because the data that I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: is from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's make sure that I'm not trying to
generalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a research agenda for
everywhere else as well, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know this of California and
especially legacy producing regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the ones that I've been able to
study the data for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other part of it is that a lot has
been done in the last 10 to 20 years to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually reduce jail populations,
local jail populations in big cities,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's been basically reforms going
on since the early 2000s that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bail reform or other things that
are helping a lot with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But folks in federal prison, it's a
population that's much more stable and
[SPEAKER_01]: much more long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of this has to do with the power
of prosecutors, especially federal
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecutors that basically increase
substantially relative to defense or
[SPEAKER_01]: judges, actually, given the criminal
justice acts of 1986, 1988, 1994,
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically created these draconian
mandatory minimums, truth and sentencing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this tough on crime legislation
that basically means that whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: you did, when you did it is actually
pretty important because if you did it in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1988, you got like, you know, 40 years to
life or something for something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, today would not get you 40 years
to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is true for every offense,
not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is part of, of course,
at the federal level, which means,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're talking about the federal
prison system, part of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means not just that cannabis is
prohibited, but like all these other drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: are also prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis is part of, you know,
this range of delinquencies essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: that the state has decided is worth like,
you know, all this effort, time and money
[SPEAKER_01]: to imprison people for and lock them up
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis is kind of a long for the
ride with the other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever there's a moral panic about
crack, cannabis also gets caught up in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about fentanyl, cannabis is going to
get caught up in it, at least federally,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, to prosecutors,
it's, it's, it's a drug crime,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's a felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a cannabis felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a, you know, some other kind of
felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually the other part that I
think in the introduction, we really lay
[SPEAKER_01]: out is like, don't forget that cannabis
prohibition, prohibition is absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: part of drug prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an entanglement that is
absolutely meta, because drug prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, takes cannabis long for the
ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with respect to, you know, who gets
prison and not, and in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wealthy white people having
licenses to sell things people are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to prison for, I would just point out that
like, even if those wealthy white people
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting arrested, they would either
not be spending any time in prison,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they would be spending basically their
time in prison club med like, like Martha
[SPEAKER_01]: Stewart, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's our criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is absolutely unequal in this country,
just like our economy is the privileges
[SPEAKER_01]: you have when you have a lot of capital
have nothing to do with whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis capital, or whether it's oil
capital, or whether it's pharma capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's privilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very important, I think not to
not to be like militantly particular about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as an issue and the prison
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, like our prison system itself is
just awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prosecutorial discretion has driven mass
incarceration.
[SPEAKER_01]: No amount of you know, legalizing discrete
supply chains of cannabis are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a large impact on what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, sure, it's very
important to advocate for people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: out of prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that like, a lot of people are
really kind of myopically focused just on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis criminals and cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it's all the other ones too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people who do just are
poor and are, you know, people of color
[SPEAKER_01]: that are caught up and trapped in this
prison system, whether or not it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of those things that I
think, in terms of the promises and goals
[SPEAKER_01]: of legalization has shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back in 2010, there was a lot of talk
about, you know, ending mass incarceration
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're legalizing cannabis,
which is always a great exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in 2020, what you have is
actually more of a like, let's put our
[SPEAKER_01]: money where our mouth is at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back then, it was just kind of a
marketing play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many ways, it did a great
disservice to black and brown people by
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing cannabis and then absolutely
having no, no part of the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: system oriented towards, you know,
actually helping black and brown people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington, we absolutely use them as
like, let's legalize cannabis because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bad for minorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then legalization comes along and
actually doesn't do anything good for
[SPEAKER_01]: people of color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's changed significantly
in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the ACLU was probably the
worst offender is much more in tune now to
[SPEAKER_01]: the realities of the situation is no
longer treating this like an advertisement
[SPEAKER_01]: for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for that perspective,
Dominic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always remixing my perspective and
I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two more questions left for our
conversation and each of them hits on
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that Professor Evan Mills is back
with an update of his groundbreaking
[SPEAKER_00]: research into electrical usage by indoor
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: His original paper kind of blew everybody
away back, I don't know, what was it,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 or so?
2012?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just floored everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers he was quoting that the
electricity that was being used by indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and for a while there anyway,
it looked like it was going to influence
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and encourage a preferred
regulatory environment for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that mostly went away as
indoor interests lobbied back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the press version of your new book
that I got did not have the chapter from
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Mills in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I and probably a lot of
other people who are familiar with that
[SPEAKER_00]: work, his early work, are curious to know
what he has to say now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I haven't read the chapter,
I don't know how to direct you on this
[SPEAKER_00]: question, but it's other than to say,
what does Evan Mills say now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you know, Evan has a lot to say
about how this is playing out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's not just engaging with like,
you know, Arcata, California, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity usage in houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's talking about a much bigger carbon
footprint when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he really especially engages
really very well with is how regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: that are supposed to be about,
you know, protecting the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because we're real worried about
as we should be, you know, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: land use, you know, impacts to wildlife,
absolutely, like those are important
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've we've got all these regulations,
actually, like, the ones that are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the most difficult for, you know,
heritage farmers are these CEQA
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we're basically
incentivizing carbon footprint intensive
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, because we're making it so
difficult to grow it outdoors and on ag
[SPEAKER_01]: land necessarily along with other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the perspective really is a bigger and
broader structural perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reviews information from California and
Colorado in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is obviously,
his paper had a big impact back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Arcata, you know, raised its
electricity tax rates and everybody moved
[SPEAKER_01]: to McKinleyville and just kept kept going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the issue, though, is that like what
Evan wants to talk about now isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated cannabis impacts necessarily
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, certainly he's concerned about that
and very, you know, not in favor of indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation because it's carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the really big, you know, problems now
are in the regulated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a critique of legalization,
not just a critique of unregulated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that in itself is profoundly
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see whether it gets the kind of
attention that his previous research did,
[SPEAKER_01]: because his previous research may have
been a little more convenient for people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that wanted to, you know,
say perfectly reasonable things about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the carbon footprint issues of
indoor cultivation, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it played along, played into, you know,
folks wanting to essentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibit or reduce the amount of cannabis
cultivation going on in this case now,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is very inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's an inconvenient truth,
but it's inconvenient to the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Evan is in fine form, you know,
addressing political and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: interests and corporate interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, are making this carbon
footprint issue, you know, or
[SPEAKER_01]: metastasizing it, just growing it
massively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, with the climate change
conversation being that much more
[SPEAKER_01]: important now than it was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that this is an intervention that
is, you know, spread as widely and as
[SPEAKER_01]: fast, as quickly as his prior one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm looking forward to reading it,
and I am glad that Evan Mills is still in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix and still looking into this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's finish off our discussion with the
chapter by our mutual friend, Dr. Michelle
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexton.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chapter, too, I'm excited to read
still, because it wasn't in the press
[SPEAKER_00]: edition, because Dr. Sexton and I have
been discussing for years the nexus of
[SPEAKER_00]: institutional science and the good work
done by citizen scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun because, you know,
like most of the topics that you cover
[SPEAKER_00]: here, it's a complex one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she and I have both evolved our ideas,
you know, over our, what, 10 years as
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and debating this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a citizen scientist myself,
I know that often my sample sizes are low
[SPEAKER_00]: and my controls perhaps not the most
complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But citizen scientists everywhere are also
working faster than institutions in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blazing new paths that institutional
researchers can, you know, follow up on
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, I'm hearing things from patients who
talk to me that are often, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not insights that are being heard by
traditional, you know, clinical doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the main arguments in this
chapter on the intersection of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen science and institutional or
academic scientists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Shango, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to just say that,
you know, Dr. Sexton is an absolutely dear
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine and helped me co-found
CASP, as did Sunil Agarwal, both
[SPEAKER_01]: contributors to this handbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was especially great to have them
both in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, I think, when it comes down
to it, you know, Michelle is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very concerned to address the entanglement
of commercialization and citizen science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And citizen science, you know,
is one thing when it's listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and responding to them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's another thing when it's
manufacturing claims in the service of
[SPEAKER_01]: selling, you know, as much CBD,
you know, distillate as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like, these are kind of the
divergent situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, one is kind of the traditional
herbal medicine citizen science that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think, you know, 10 years ago,
or eight years ago, when you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: met her, she was at the forefront of,
certainly, first analytics lab in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington State, a naturopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of this explosion of all
these claims that get made that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of issues, but the primary one
is that they're incentivized by
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially the supply chain and
marketing, especially around CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this can be problematic for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is just like, taking an anecdote and
like, you know, turning it into a law of
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And saying that this will always help
everyone just buy this CBD, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get your gas station,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Delta A, everything else is going
to gas stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are those claims made that are
bastardizations of citizen science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm doing, I think I'm doing a
chapter service by clarifying this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are those claims that they come
out of a tradition of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: healing and patient centric, you know,
clinical observational research in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, that was not possible under
conditions of prohibition, just
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, not just prohibition with
legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is essentially the,
you know, commercial incentive to take
[SPEAKER_01]: those claims and completely divorce them
from the intimate social relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: that characterize, you know, traditional
herbal medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is, I think, absolutely a
fantastic intervention that could have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone in the public health section,
but we chose to put it in to the culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and social change section because it's,
it's, it's about to me, this, this
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural difference, between like the
commercialization, basically cultures of
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialization and cultures of care,
patient centric care, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So citizen science is both something that
has helped and also something that others
[SPEAKER_01]: have bastardized basically to make a bunch
of money off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that to me makes it an incredibly
important chapter because what happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: a backlash, and I think you're seeing it a
lot actually, and you will see more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the backlash is from, you know,
policymakers and health researchers who
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly see through essentially the
commercialization of these claims,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they don't really also understand that
the citizen science actually has been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of important work on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they discount really the traditional
herbal medicine thing and hitch their
[SPEAKER_01]: wagons to like the pharmaceuticalization
of cannabis entirely, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels safer to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like look at these CBD
companies, you know, and so like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Michelle shares their distastes,
but doesn't have that distaste for actual,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, she's a naturopathic doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like in many ways, it's,
to preserve the integrity of actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the entire, you know,
tradition of herbal medicine, herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional medicine, which is finally
becoming recognized in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last 30 years as something that's
actually valid, but still is kind of seen
[SPEAKER_01]: as, you know, not scientific, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not, it's not working with
molecules and standardizations as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to herbal medicine, which can work with
like the whole plant and actually actually
[SPEAKER_01]: address differences in people's,
you know, body chemistry that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: standardizing medicine is a terrible idea
from a certain perspective because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's bodies are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a really, really crucial
intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see more of it, but it's
really kind of this like, we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to become snake oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like when it comes down to it,
snake oil is all about marketing over,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But safety is not defined by
pharmaceutical procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is something that is part of the
herbal tradition as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if Dr. Sexton is listening to this,
I hope I've done her chapter, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of service it deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crucial intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very happy to see Dr. Michelle
Sexton's chapter in the book for a host of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I like is that she's always been
a friend to the patient first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she has been involved,
you know, advising different companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, she's been working with
cannabis as an herbalist for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even myself, you know, with Michelle
and I being allies and having very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: agendas, she would often catch me and say,
well, you know, Shango, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overstating what we know about cannabis
based on your anecdotal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that would frustrate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I had to come back to what's real
and realize that, you know, relying too
[SPEAKER_00]: much on hype is where we get into these
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if Dr. Michelle Sexton is
anything, she is anti-hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I am grateful for the chapter
and her participation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dominic, thank you so much for your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, congratulations on the release of
this collection you edited with Joshua
[SPEAKER_00]: Maisel, The Routledge Handbook of
Post-Prohibition Cannabis Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can folks get the book?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first of all, let me actually,
because I haven't yet in this interview,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to express my profound gratitude
towards my partner in this project,
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh Maisel, Humboldt State University
sociologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been just, we've been a dream team
together and we're doing a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: things together too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just am so grateful for his
friendship and collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he deserves a lot of credit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to make sure that I don't
leave him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the other thing is, of course,
is that you can buy the handbook on
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy it on routledge.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Routledge is a global academic publisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hardback version right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a soft cover that's
going to be much less expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book is, you know, part of the
Routledge Handbook series, which is sold
[SPEAKER_01]: to universities around the globe,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a price that is essentially
reflecting the, you know, business model
[SPEAKER_01]: of Routledge, which is that universities
are, you know, institutions and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pay more for books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and then there's also obviously an
electronic document, which is also often
[SPEAKER_01]: very good for universities to get because
then they can, their students can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the kind of handbook that is going
to have a much wider appeal though and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I recognize that and I want to make
sure that folks don't feel like they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, economically squeezed out
because of the, you know, at 25% off,
[SPEAKER_01]: $200 price of the hardcover.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a soft cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be out, you know, in a few months
and, you know, strongly encourage folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who are not, you know, particularly
wealthy, you know, not to go out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: way and get the expensive one,
but the cheaper one will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dominic, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both, both, I appreciate your friendship
and our very long time working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you join us, here on Shaping
Fire or on my prior podcast, you always
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I really appreciate that you
don't let yourself get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut up in the, cut up in all the
excitement and the hoo-ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're always telling me, well,
Shango, it's not as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at this in a more complex
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I very much appreciate you and,
and, and thank you for joining us on
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am absolutely proud of, of your program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen to it regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, it's been a pleasure and an
honor knowing you and look forward to a
[SPEAKER_01]: long and wonderful friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
