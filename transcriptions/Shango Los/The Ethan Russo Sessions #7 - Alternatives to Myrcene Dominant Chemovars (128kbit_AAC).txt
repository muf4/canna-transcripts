[SPEAKER_00]: So Ethan, very often when you speak,
you talk about how so much of the present
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market is chemovars that are
heavily myrcine based, that you travel
[SPEAKER_00]: around the country and it's like myrcine
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always want to ask the next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dr. Russo, if there's too much
myrcine in all of the commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: available cannabis, what would you like
there to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say that we could pie in the
sky, if you could wave your hands and have
[SPEAKER_00]: the existence of particular chemovars that
were heavy in particular terpenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles, what would you like to
see if you could just snap your fingers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, well there'd be a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alpha-pinene is hard to find in most
modern cannabis chemovars and it is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the key ingredient in limiting the
short-term memory impairment that THC
[SPEAKER_01]: produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it does this is as an
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acetylcholine is the memory molecule in
the brain and by preventing its breakdown,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more of it and people can think
more clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the patient who has to work or
study while trying to treat their pain or
[SPEAKER_01]: other symptoms, having a good bit of
alpha-pinene in the mix is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a sidebar, if a patient does need to
work and they also need to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for relief, would it help them to
be using their THC but also have
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha-pinene in an aromatherapy diffuser
in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would they work together like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well sure, if it were from a natural
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they were using some kind of
pine-based essential oil, yeah that could
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally, it would be better to have a
cannabis-based medicine that had
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha-pinene in it, hopefully replacing
some of the mercine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention, mercine isn't all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do call it the couchlock factor in
cannabis when combined with THC because of
[SPEAKER_01]: its marked sedative effect, a sort of
narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is analgesic, a painkiller in its
own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly would help with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another component that would be really
helpful to have is limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limonene is a very powerful antidepressant
and immune stimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this brightens up the effects of
THC and produces a vibrancy to the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that clearly are a bigger
advantage for someone with a mood
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one would be linalool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linalool is the main component of lavender
essential oil which is well known as an
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-anxiety agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can have some sedative effects but it's
not a knock you out kind of experience
[SPEAKER_01]: like mercine can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good one particularly for
patients with seizure disorders because it
[SPEAKER_01]: has an anticonvulsant effect as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth one that would be really good to
have more of is karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karyophylline is a really interesting
agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a terpenoid but at the same time
it's a cannabinoid because it works on the
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC also works on the CB2 receptor but
actually karyophylline is more effective
[SPEAKER_01]: on this receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it provides anti-inflammatory benefits
and pain relief without psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly this is a good thing to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: An additional factor with karyophylline is
that it has an anti-addictive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be extremely helpful for the
patient who might have chronic pain and be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking opioids at the same time as their
cannabis based medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just take these four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having more of these individual
terpenes in terpene profiles in chemovars
[SPEAKER_00]: is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we took it to an extreme and said
that we had a chemovar that had a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of each of those in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they work as well together or you've
taught before that sometimes these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and cannabinoids if they're by
themselves they'll act as an agonist but
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're with other things act as an
antagonist because they mix and match
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it generally better to have more
terpenes and more variety in most cases or
[SPEAKER_00]: really do you do you really kind of want
to breed your cannabis for particular
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and try to stick with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well having a variety of terpenes is going
to create a more interesting experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably provide more general symptom
relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: However again if I know the person's
condition and what we're trying to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: gives me an idea of what terpenoids we
might have them look for and again with
[SPEAKER_01]: the lack of diversity in the current
market in most areas this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard thing to accomplish but again I'm
thinking of this in an aspirational sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that we know that these things can be an
advantage and we want the market to head
[SPEAKER_01]: in the direction of providing more varied
chemovars that can provide the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles that are going to be better
suited to treating these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to hear more about this
I've got two great sources for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first comment there'll be a link to
Ethan's paper on this topic taming
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and then his follow-up paper as
well and then also we did about 90 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: on two different episodes so like three
hours on this topic on the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast so check out links for both of
those below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
