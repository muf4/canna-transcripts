[SPEAKER_00]: Let's offer Sunny a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for getting up so early and joining
me today to talk about solar microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really important to look
at a growing system as a system as
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is interconnected, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you walk around here and you see a
bunch of people with different products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nutrients, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything's kind of compartmentalized
into different, you know, products or
[SPEAKER_02]: different emphasis at looking at the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so today we're going to tie everything
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to start by actually,
there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say a little bit more about myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see from this illuminating
photo, I definitely have liked to play in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mud for a long time and that's not
really why I chose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here is I'm at my
grandparents farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in a city and I was always
trying to get out, you know, dive further
[SPEAKER_02]: into natural systems and be in the
wilderness or in the mud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my grandfather, he would turn on the
water at one end of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a slight incline and the water
would flow down and I would spend hours
[SPEAKER_02]: and days designing these complex
hydrological systems, culverts,
[SPEAKER_02]: canals, bridges, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look back at this and realize how
long I've really been interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: systems design and the importance of
looking at where things are coming from,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're going, how they got there,
etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that thinking transits
really well into growing a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully and with a little struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shango kind of covered it with what I do
with Miller Soils and my background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know a little bit about you
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who here grows plants of any type?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we have any commercial cultivators
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of this will sound familiar,
but I think it applies to everyone,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, because a lot of the canvas
industry is set up for growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: is in potting soils, container systems,
or hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're removing a plant from its
natural environment, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about how plants grow in their
natural environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to translate that back to these design
systems of sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a quick overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start in the phylosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the environment for microbes
above ground, everywhere on the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk about what plants
need, where they're getting it from,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will dive down into the
rhizosphere and talk about some basic soil
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So soil structure, nutrient uptake,
how plants are acquiring to their roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as soil organisms and the
relationships of everything in play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, we're going to have questions at
the end, but if at any point you guys need
[SPEAKER_02]: some clarification, just toss your hand
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love for this to be as conversational
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's pertinent to what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's something irrelevant, let's talk
about it at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to do a quick slide here on
ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an ecologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, ecology, this is the Mary
Webster definition of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The totality or pattern of relations
between organisms and their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though we're talking about soil
and soil health today, this talk is really
[SPEAKER_02]: about relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes from the Latin root eco,
house environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout these slides, you'll see little
green boxes with the Latin and Greek roots
[SPEAKER_02]: for things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important to
understand what a word means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it really matter how you pronounce it
or whatnot?
[SPEAKER_02]: But really understanding what it means in
your plant system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can basically divide anything in
the world into a biotic or abiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: element.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these characteristics, biotic is
anything living.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carbon base, it came from something
living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was living at one point or a living
creature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants, animals, organisms,
and their byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything abiotic, these are the nonliving
features.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rocks, minerals, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wind, temperature, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take pH, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that would determine the
habitat for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your soil has a lower pH, it's going to
attract plants that have a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blueberries, they like a really acidic
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four to five on the pH scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to determine their
habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's all these other factors
that are going to determine their success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So organic matter, what is the quality of
your compost, how much do you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, a biologist would study
anything living.
[SPEAKER_02]: A geologist is going to study rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A meteorologist is going to study weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: An ecologist is studying how all of those
systems are intertwined.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I chose this picture of a goat in a
tree, this is on the Greek island of
[SPEAKER_02]: Crete.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to put ecology into a
photo without a bunch of arrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought this did a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could any of you guess why this goat is in
a tree?
Eating leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's a great, obvious one right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eating leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can see, this is a pretty arid
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of green things to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this tree provides a source of
nutrition for the goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also see there's an environmental
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't totally tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I know you guys didn't come here
to talk about goats, but we'll move on to
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants really, you know, they don't
need anything too crazy, but there are
[SPEAKER_02]: some very essential things that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anyone familiar with Maslow's hierarchy
of needs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Maslow is a psychologist, and he
studied foundational needs for human
[SPEAKER_02]: survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom pillar of that is all
physiological, and those are exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: plants need as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean air, clean water, clean food,
hopefully clean food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shelter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shelter, this doesn't mean just like a
roof over their heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most plants would prefer not to have a
roof over their heads actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: but more the right environment for them to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So light, both physical and not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature, humidity, and relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relationships really could be on its own
bubble, because they aren't as necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: to plant survival as something like water,
but we'll talk more about relationships in
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is where I take some of you
guys back to high school, biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry maybe even, and just want to go
over gas exchange really quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: just so we're all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's four states of matter in this
world, solids, liquids, glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: and plasma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got these three molecules,
carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in their gaseous form, they are very
important to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this all has its C3 vascular plants,
which cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there's a lot of different
types of plants out there, but we are at a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis conference, so this is what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine I'm a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking in photons from the light,
the sun above me, as well as carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: dioxide from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pulling water up through my roots,
and combining that in my leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a total miracle really of life,
called photosynthesis, and creating
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the equation down here for
anyone that wants to do the math,
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically six of each of those
molecules combine to produce glucose,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a simple form of sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant either uses that glucose to form
its mechanical operation, or it can
[SPEAKER_02]: convert it through a process called
respiration to store it for later use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So respiration is effectively the opposite
of photosynthesis in terms of where the
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds are moving, but the plant is
actually taking O2 in through its leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: and respiring carbon dioxide and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And humans do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine you have a big day of exertion
ahead of you, and you take in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrates, maybe in the form of a bowl
of pasta, and you go out the next day,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're running hard, doing something
hard, and your body's actually converting
[SPEAKER_02]: those sugars into energy, and you are
sweating, giving off water, and exhaling
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon dioxide, and taking in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is gas exchange in another way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the whole process by which
plants are taking water up through their
[SPEAKER_02]: roots and expiring it through their
leaves, or it's respiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all goes through the stoma,
which means now it actually functions more
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lung of sorts, but there's two
guard cells, and these are tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of them are actually on the bottom
side of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, they're usually open
during the day, closed at night,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also has to do with the whole
environment, how much carbon dioxide there
[SPEAKER_02]: is, and how much the plant is actually
processing at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these actually fill up with a fluid to
open, so they're under a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is how everything leaves the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the plant is slowing down,
it's not going through photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_02]: not processing, it will actually close
them in a more dormant form of sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just talked about how plants are
pulling things into their bodies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but how do they get things around?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's through vascular motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vascular meaning vessel or duct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also are vascular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine our veins moving blood around to
transport oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of just one vein, plants
actually have two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the xylem and the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Xylem is responsible for bringing things
up from the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way up to the leaves and
dispersing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really three main functions of
xylem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water transport is the first, and it uses
capillary action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nature's efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's evolved over millions of years to
function as it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things have adapted to become more and
more efficient for their environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think, wow, a plant is moving
against gravity to move things around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem very logical or
efficient, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually using capillary
action, which is a phenomenon by which you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a long narrow space and water will
move up very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine like a straw or a piece of
fabric where water will go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually moving between those pores
between the fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does still use energy to do so,
but the size of the xylem tubes actually
[SPEAKER_02]: help a lot with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transplational pull is another effect that
is helping with water transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the idea of pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have your water vapor is leading
through the stoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exiting the plant and there's a void
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And naturally, your plant wants to fill
that void and relieve the pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it pulls more water up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of just like a cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always continual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leads to turgor pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a plant is turgor, it is full of
these fluids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine a plant that's wilted because it's
going through drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is because it's actually
stressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's losing its posture because it's
not functioning and the transpiration
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't happening correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually bending over a little bit
because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the more significant things that
xylem does is nutrient delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants take up nutrients through their
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how they move around the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then there's the phloem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are bundled together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture of one right down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phloem's on the outside, that one's in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or rather, phloem is where things go in
both directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's mobile nutrients and immobile
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile ones move around the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant can send them where they're
needed most.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how they get around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see there's a little,
it looks like a drain of sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: A horizontal blockage withholding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually slows the flow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this picture right here, that's
actually an electron photo of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the vascular bundles in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's quite beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys ready to dive in?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just chatted about everything that's
going on above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, there's a lot more going on
underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you came to this talk because
there were rhizospheres in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the area where the roots are and
where the microbes live around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rhizome means root, spherizome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's literally the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of it right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see your plant's roots coming
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gray around it is actually
everywhere where it's exudating,
[SPEAKER_02]: things to attract soil life to come to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk a lot more about
that in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have an image.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: A healthy plant is actually going to send
10% to 45% of its energy down through its
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Energy meaning different forms of sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your photosynthesis, those byproducts
of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about root
morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a root right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's divided into three sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got cell, the zone of cellular
division.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually where cells are
created.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little root cap on the very end
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that acts as, basically, it's like a
helmet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the first piece of the root
that's cruising through the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it comes across a rock or whatnot,
it's nice to have a little helmet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underneath it is the apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where a lot of hormone
production occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a root apical meristem as well as
a shoot apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like the brain of a
plant, right under the helmet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my favorite hormones is auxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of important plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one's actually responsible for
bud dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inhibiting lateral growth as well as
promoting elongation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hormones are wild and really form what
we are, what everything is in this world
[SPEAKER_02]: in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what triggers a lot of plant
traits, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving up, we've got the zone of
elongation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the purple and red there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the vascular system
starting to form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where after cells have gotten
their end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where you see a lot of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're moving into the zone of
maturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where you start to see root
hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And root hairs, this is where all nutrient
water uptake occurs, at least below
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say a root morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a little triangle on there to
remember everything that a plant needs
[SPEAKER_02]: above ground, it also needs below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's both for the plant and for your
soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So air, water, shelter, and food.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rhizosphere, I like to think of it
kind of like the shakedown street of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where all the goodies are exchanged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a fun place.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have 10 minutes left?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basic soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go as deep or not as deep into this
as you guys like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, let's talk about soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up here, we've got all the horizons of
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a native soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about the sea horizon
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the parent material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And down here, we've got three different
sizes of mineral particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are rocks that have been broken
up from some sort of weathering process
[SPEAKER_02]: that are derived from the parent material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending where you are in the world,
you're going to have a very different
[SPEAKER_02]: parent material, as well as what's going
on above and the moisture and the flora
[SPEAKER_02]: and fauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all combines to create your soil type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So particle size is a huge element that's
going to affect your soil quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sand is the biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clay is the smallest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silt's somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sand is about 200 times bigger than a clay
particle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, I have a picture of loam.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sandy loam, a clay loam.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, loam is a very diverse
soil texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have a nice mix of sand,
silt, and clay particles, which happens to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow really nice leafy plants like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on what type of plant you're
going to grow, or rather what kind of soil
[SPEAKER_02]: you have, that is going to affect the
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an all-sand soil,
it's going to have really high drainage,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is great if you're in the desert and
water's running through and those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to retain water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going to compact easily,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not going to retain much
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So retention's really important for your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic matter and soil microbes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic matter, think your biotic factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything carbon-based that is alive,
was alive, came from something alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your soil, you have roots,
cumus, which is decomposed organic matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms moving around, and root
exudates, or exudates from your organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything sticky left behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other half of the pie, we've got pore
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So roughly half and half, it's going to be
water and air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that's not physically staying
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really important for your gas
exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want those roots to be able to give off
carbon dioxide and take in more oxygen and
[SPEAKER_02]: vice versa, as well as for water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water needs to get through to get to your
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty elemental to have pore space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And biology helps a lot creating pore
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether that be a root or a worm or a
tiny bacteria moving through that soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually creating space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So behind it, there's going to be a void
and probably some sort of film that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to add into your soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's soil texture and composition in
a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all adds to lead to soil structure,
which is kind of a blanket way to observe
[SPEAKER_02]: and measure soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your particles are going to combine
with biotic factors to lead to aggregate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an aggregation, this right here is an
aggregate of the yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: These would be your mineral particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red, we've got fungal hyphae, which is
basically like the root of a fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's bacterial colonies in here
breaking down organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all stuck together and working
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hyphae are really good at actually mining
nutrients from rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, they're loving all over
those particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so your aggregates are held together
in general by water film, microbial glues,
[SPEAKER_02]: and roots in hyphae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a soil particle that combines
to make a soil aggregate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all together combined, it makes your
soil structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a picture of friable loam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how dark and rich it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sticking together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of in general like a field test is
if you could pick up your soil and squeeze
[SPEAKER_02]: it into a ball and it stays.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you drop it and it crumbles,
likely you're in good shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you should get it tested and
figure out what else is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's an easy way to measure organic
matter in the field without a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we can't really talk about soil
ecology without talking about nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the right here, we have all the
essential plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Structural elements, carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, everything that's coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: above and the plants using to create
sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything below from nitrogen
down to zinc is actually coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can pull your feet as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the majority of nature, that's where
it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants can only absorb nutrients in ionic
forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: An ion is something with a charge,
either positive, a cation, or negative,
[SPEAKER_02]: an anion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the right, you see these ionic forms
that a plant can uptake nutrients in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And water is dipolar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a miracle that we have life on
this earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it is because water is
dipolar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see these Mickey Mouse shaped
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the oxygen and the hydrogen,
the ears there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a positive charge on that side
of the atom and a negative on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can actually bond with both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neutral in its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can also bond with both cations and
anions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I want to talk about is
chelation, meaning flaw in Greek.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually the ability of the
proteins or an organic acid to bond with a
[SPEAKER_02]: metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it a lot easier for the plant
to uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant can still uptake a metal when it's
not an acylate.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it uses a lot of energy to
process that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can have your trace metals in
acylated form in your soil, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: save your plant a lot of energy and be
able to use that to feed your microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made a little note here to keep
synthetics under 250 BPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's a pretty high number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather, keep them under 350 if you're
trying to keep your soil food level alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes can take a little bit of
synthetics, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will desiccate them and dry them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working for a living soil here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have our root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where nutrients are being taken up,
you can see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple I have as anions, cations,
or yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the water solution,
and they go up to the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: 95% or so of nutrient uptake happens
through mass flow, so being carried by
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to rush through this because
we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But takeaway message, nutrient uptake will
affect your pH as well as the affected
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when your plant takes up a cation,
it's going to spit out a
[SPEAKER_02]: positively-charged hydrogen ion,
which is going to lower your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most nutrients are in cationic form,
which is why, over time, soils desiccate
[SPEAKER_02]: by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice versa for anions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plant takes up a negatively-charged
ion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to put out OH minus,
which will actually neutralize your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: CEC, this is a really important element of
soil fertility, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with the overall charge of
your material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clay has a really high CEC, so it actually
holds onto cations really well because it
[SPEAKER_02]: has a negative charge overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as your plant's growing and it's
looking for nutrients, it's going to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: out and take a cation off of that material
with a high CEC and spit out other
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrogen in a positive form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So materials with a high CEC will help
buffer and keep those hydrogens out of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: This image, I think, describes it really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the particles on the left don't
have a high CEC, so when water comes
[SPEAKER_02]: through, it's going to take the nutrients
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on the right, water goes through
and the nutrients stay because it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: electrostatic attraction happening between
positive and negative ions there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a high CEC will help with more nutrient
retention as well as buffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some materials with high CEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humus, clay, vermiculae, biochar,
one of our favorite Miller soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to keep going,
get to the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil food web is basically anything
alive in the soil that spends all or part
[SPEAKER_02]: of its life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the left, we've got your
photosynthesizers and their byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then moving to the second trophic
level, we've got nematodes, fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nematodes here, these are actually
parasitic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're your root feeding nematodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't want those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But however you see, they're in three
different categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different kinds and they
serve a lot of different functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So third trophic level, you have your
orthopause, nematodes, protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to just keep it to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep it for the full-time
soil dwellers for this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your soil food web, again,
they eat everything your plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean water, clean food, shelter,
and nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or air, rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things that they help
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they help suppress diseases and help
with nutrient cycling, which is a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit if you're trying to eliminate
inputs into your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pathogen defense, aeration, they're moving
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They help with buffering your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can introduce the characters really
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria usually thrive in, or beneficial
bacteria thrive in aerobic environments,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're usually going to thrive in a
pH over six.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have symbiotic relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this rhizobium nodule right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, they form relationships
with legumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mount themselves right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They colonize the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant is going to give sugars in
exchange for, they can fix nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_02]: the atmosphere, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's triple-blonded nitrogen gases,
so it's very hard to separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always wants to return to that
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are doing a lot of work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then down here, we have some
decomposers, cocus, the round.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can either be in chains or just
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bacillus bacteria are breaking down
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even like to call it the exudib
hebrella.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come by our booth, and I can talk
some more about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're booth 361.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a late start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to thank you all for coming and
recognizing the importance of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just go forward to something
that summarized all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tying it all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your soil works with your plant roots
by providing a habitat for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots are giving back, aggregation,
aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the relationship with your soil
microbes and your soil slash your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: medium is providing aeration, breaking
down material, producing humates,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are also very important,
which we'll talk about at the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And soil microbes to plant roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we were just talking about,
they are living in a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship, exchanging things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think there's a lot of
questions to be asked about soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you look at it, just think,
what does my plant need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can I use what's already there to
feed the plant and close the loop of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm going to end it right there,
and we'll have some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're going to move over a
little bit, because I'm sure there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably have time for two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a question, raise your
hand, and I will bring you the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on knee meal as a
top dressing and living soil system?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like Dr. Manehan has a little bit
of a different view than Jeff Rontels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if you could add a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knee meal, I personally don't use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little bit of a retroactive
thing to address for a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or rather, if you're using it,
it's retroactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can avoid having to use it in
the first place, looking back at your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and getting all the
beneficials in there to create your own
[SPEAKER_02]: defense for the plant without having to
bring that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, if you're going to
use it, use it lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a top dress, in my opinion,
is better than using it in a full dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a little bit better than
using it in a full dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: that to living soil, it does beat up on
the microbe life, but what I'm hoping you
[SPEAKER_00]: can weigh for me is how much does it beat
up on the microbe life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the patients that I'm trying to
help them set up their gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really want to produce probiotic
flowers, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so difficult for them to get outside
and collect rainwater or get it from a
[SPEAKER_00]: stream if it's an appropriate place to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad really is it to be using faucet
water in a house in a non-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: non-commercial environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question, and it's really
hard to answer because everyone's faucet
[SPEAKER_02]: water is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in a certain place where you have
the same source for your water,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of a client that we have in
Boulder, Colorado, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoirs in Colorado, and they actually
change the sourcing from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So throughout the year, they noticed a
huge spike actually in boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing this whole test measuring
their plants, doing tissue culture as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as their soil throughout a cycle to see
what the plant was taking up and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: was being converted, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they noticed this spike in boron,
and we couldn't figure it out and ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to someone with the public water
department, and they had recently changed
[SPEAKER_02]: to a new source of water and got the
results on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually a lot of boron in it,
and so it was accumulating in their soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just one little anecdote about
water sourcing is really know what's in
[SPEAKER_02]: your water, and I don't think all
jurisdictions will release it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but see if you can look at what's in the
water and get results on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be public knowledge in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of chlorine and chloramine,
that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely helps to let your water off
gas and release chlorine over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: let it sit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Using a carbon, a fixed carbon or charcoal
filter to remove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
