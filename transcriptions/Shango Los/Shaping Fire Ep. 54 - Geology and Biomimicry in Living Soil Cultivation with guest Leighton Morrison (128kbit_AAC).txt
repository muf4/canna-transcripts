[SPEAKER_01]: It's odd when you get to the point in
cannabis growing where you realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: the best support you can give to a plant
is simply to create the best soil possible
[SPEAKER_01]: and not to feed the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being brought up the way we have to try
and force feed the plant nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, and phosphorus, the idea that
it is our job to feed the soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil feeds the plant breaks nearly all
of the traditional rules around growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis during prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last 60 years of growing cannabis has
been susceptible to the same pressures as
[SPEAKER_01]: regular food agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that dumping chemicals on our
food would produce more healthier food was
[SPEAKER_01]: a bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, according to the UN, a future of
thousands and thousands of smaller food
[SPEAKER_01]: farms growing organically is arising as
the new best standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same goes for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis cultivation moves out of the
basement and into greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more we coax natural systems instead
of trying to replace them, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: success we are having producing healthy
cannabis with great terpene profiles and
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, the more we can truly emulate
the earth in our cultivation systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more success we will have.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today my guest is geologist and living
soil expert, Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton has been a lifelong enthusiast of
both aquaponics and living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: His obsession with biosphere, too,
led him to set up an aquaculture system at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Rodale Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton worked with world-renowned soil
biologist Dr. Elaine Ingham, blending his
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture byproducts with traditional
compost and worm castings to prove that
[SPEAKER_01]: natural inputs could effectively replace
synthetics and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton currently is founder of Kingdom
Aquaponics and invented their line of
[SPEAKER_01]: living compost and compost tea products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton is a sought-after public speaker
and co-founder of the series of Traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: Science Organic Regenerative Cannabis
Cultivation conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about building
your soil to match the Earth's systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got this spinning globe
floating around in space around the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun's providing heat and cooling when the
Sun's not out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have an atmosphere that begins
to happen and moisture begins to form and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bottom line is that weather is what
created the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the life and how it got here,
that's a little bit deeper, but we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stick with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was its own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, all soil is formed through
erosion and then transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by erosion, let's start with ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice is a great one because it is
unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll push through mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will create streams, rivers,
ravines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sun creates heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at rock on mountains,
you'll often see that there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: pebbles and boulders at the bottom of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of that heating and
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time that rock heats or cools,
there forms a little fissure in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the water gets in that little fissure
and freezes and pops off that chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times that by a billion or a trillion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're starting to wrap your head
around the fact that that rock can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually pulverize itself down to a small
enough particular that it begins to build
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the most important part for
people to understand is that during that
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion process, you're having many
different particulate sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I disagree with soil
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil science classifies sand, silt and
clay because of their particulate sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not of their content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put clay in water, it has a
completely different specific gravity and
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction in that water than if I throw
sand in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, when we do what's called a textural
test, which is basically taking soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it in a jar, adding some water,
leaving a little air and shaking the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and then set it down and walk
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 36 hours, you come back and you'll
have perfect layers of what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter will be floating on the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom layer will be sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second layer will be silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last layer will be clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do this and you look at it,
you'll be like, wow, that's really dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're done two days later,
the water is clear and everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: separated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an obvious specific gravity
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an obvious chemical makeup
difference or molecular bond difference to
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is soil science not saying well,
that's clay because it holds a magnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some nutritional properties to it,
where the sand doesn't carry any
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you take clay, you get it wet,
you squeeze it into a ball in your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get sand wet and you squeeze it
into a ball, it doesn't stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fall apart again, depending on how
pure that is sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all have these different
properties to them, but we're classifying
[SPEAKER_00]: them all based on particulate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a lot of work left to do,
my friend, as far as that's concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love this image of the earth being
this big rock with all of these jagged
[SPEAKER_01]: edges that are mountains and that moisture
forms because of the heating and cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets in between these crevices and
over epochs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks down these mountains into
smaller and smaller pieces that become
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're calling soil, but what soil is
made of, the silt and the clay and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sand, these different bits, did all of
these originally start as mountains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't the mountain break down into
all of the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a glacier pushes through a mountain and
what comes out of the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: glacier mixed with the water is clay,
clay platelets, tiny, tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: platelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever studied and looked at
these, they stack up and when they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like little flying saucers, little disks,
and when they're magnetically charged and
[SPEAKER_00]: they stack up, what happens is you get one
flat one and then one standing on an edge
[SPEAKER_00]: and then another flat one lands on top of
that and another one stands up on his
[SPEAKER_00]: edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in compaction, those all lay flat on
top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good enough visual?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm following that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an electric charge involved
with clay platelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no electrical charge in silt and
there's no electrical charge in sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand can be quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be pure mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be calcium from past coral
reefs, which is pretty common with sand
[SPEAKER_00]: and silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt is just organic matter broken all the
way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why silt comes from rivers and from
streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though the process is the same,
the breaking down process of having
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture, having it get frozen and then
broken down, even that is the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get these different ingredients to
soil because of what the mountain or the
[SPEAKER_01]: coral reef or the river is made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same process of breaking,
making small particles, but they all come
[SPEAKER_01]: from different parts of the earth that was
originally cold and just spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rabbit hole, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a rock, but how do we end up
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life had to come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology had to land here, had to start
growing something and plants and animals
[SPEAKER_00]: came from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants as they broke down became the
silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clay and sand, sand that is not coral
based, came from the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the silt and the organic matter and
the life form created the coral and the
[SPEAKER_00]: silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's complicated, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting too, though,
because that means that as more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: life spawned on earth, the soil content
got richer and richer and it became kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a geometric increase of ability to
carry life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spot on, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, clearly as life forms were
evolving and, you know, we went through
[SPEAKER_01]: these different glacial periods over like
huge, huge amounts of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: About how long ago did we get to the earth
and the soil structure as we generally see
[SPEAKER_01]: it today?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first or the theory behind the
first life on this planet that began that
[SPEAKER_00]: process of breaking down or using these
ingredients to create biomass or more life
[SPEAKER_00]: was when the hydra came onto the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we had two individual cells that
had to communicate and this gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another deep rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line, it was probably somewhere
around two and a half million years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three, depending on who the
scientist is you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what started the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first had a single cell organism,
then we had a multi-cell organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we had things in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the first living thing on the
surface of the earth as far as plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned was mushrooms, which is really,
really interesting because fungal kingdoms
[SPEAKER_00]: are a whole other world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then those mushrooms, which grow
very quickly, as most people know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fruit pretty quickly, started building
that organic matter first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden plants started
showing up and it wasn't trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd probably call them weeds,
but they were the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation to when this planet became
forested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's another really bad ass event
that happened, and we don't know how it
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, but grass showed up on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was hundreds of millions of years
after trees had pretty much taken over the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grass shows up in the savannas in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grass choked out the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you still see it to some degree
today, these meadows, these rogue meadows
[SPEAKER_00]: on mountains if you're hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all kinds of debate and
like, well, where'd the grass come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did it come from space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it come on a comet like life did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did God just go, hey, you guys need
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did an alien stop by and seed a
frigging seed an area?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moving through succession,
all of a sudden now we have grass and
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the real diversity began
as far as life is concerned on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, the apes now had to
move from one patch of trees to another as
[SPEAKER_00]: they ran out of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of forced them to walk on hind
legs so that they could see over the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure there was a predator that
was gonna jump out and eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that combination right there was what I
would consider when Earth became more like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Garden of Eden that it was until man
got crazy in the industrial revolution and
[SPEAKER_00]: really started to mess things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, that's a beautiful transition
because that's where I'm going next as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we've got an idea of how
nature formed, you know, a thumbnail of it
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, with a lot of potential rabbit
holes to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so then like humans and agriculture
show up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and so I'm curious that,
you know, did soil begin to especially
[SPEAKER_01]: change faster after human agriculture
showed up or is our impact relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: small compared to glaciers and such moving
it around?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's let's talk about natural
disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about earthquakes and
volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the reasons the redwoods
are where they are is because of volcanic
[SPEAKER_00]: ash is so fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody's heard of azomite,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to bend your mind a little bit
more and say the reason that those
[SPEAKER_00]: redwoods are concentrated on the Pacific
was because the volcanoes were there and
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind was blowing from east to west,
not west to east.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of located them on that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the if the if the ash had been
blowing east, you would have much more
[SPEAKER_00]: redwood and diversity going toward the
east than you do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get those high mountain kind of
plateaus where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands, but you lose the trees as you
drive from Washington from west to east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing happens in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you go west, you get into
desert, more arid, less fertile climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you now add in the fact of
continental drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were once just one big giant
continent that broke apart and created
[SPEAKER_00]: these different multi-climated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's there's a lot more
to starting to under understand how those
[SPEAKER_00]: soils really form, because I think it's
like 80 percent of all soils on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet were formed through transpiration,
transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the air picked up some
dust and blew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite stories that I love to
talk about is in 2011, NASA did a study
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically concluded that all of the
sandstorms in the Sahara Desert were
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing so much dust into the atmosphere
and it was traveling way, way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was blowing across the ocean
and then somehow coming back down to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide phosphorus for the Amazon
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some believe that it was particularly
charged when it hit the I forget what the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere where Tesla wanted to store all
the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we have an outer atmosphere
where it's very magnetic and very
[SPEAKER_00]: electrically charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some believe that those particles got that
high and all of a sudden they started
[SPEAKER_00]: attaching to each other until they formed
small molecules, which now through gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: were forced to drop to the surface of the
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say, well, now it's the moisture
and the clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's it's deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and just recently a new guy grabbed
that and ran with it and and come to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out that it wasn't just phosphorus,
it was fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fertilizer came from diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to talk about diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatoms produce, I think it's close to 60
percent of all of the oxygen on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming from the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxygen that's growing down in the
Amazon rainforest is being used up down
[SPEAKER_00]: there in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not getting up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're breathing, the reason we
have oxygen up here is because of diatoms
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plants, because obviously the
plants pull in CO2 and they excrete
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other part of that piece that no
one talks about is these little creatures
[SPEAKER_00]: called diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know what a diatom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A diatom, you know, people wanted to throw
it into the bacterial kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has a chloroplast in it,
which is a tiny little solar array that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes light and creates energy and allows
it to multiply, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: and live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others want to throw in a plant
kingdom because, hey, it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't fit into either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, where my bitch in
science is, is that we're trying to land
[SPEAKER_00]: on Mars, but we don't even understand what
the hell's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, Leonardo da Vinci said it back in
1745.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know more about the movement of the
celestial bodies overhead than we know
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's underfoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why haven't we started to focus on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we need water to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into the water cycle and how
critical soil is for the water cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is one of those things where
I've always tell people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you really interested in this stuff,
buy the DVD Symphony for Symphony of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an hour and 20 minutes of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will pop your cork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in part of that video, they have an
experiment that was performed down at
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodale where they had four bottles that
they filled soil with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left, I believe,
was a pure synthetic farming system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one to the far right, I believe,
was a pure organic soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he takes 100 milliliters of water,
something like that, and he dumps into
[SPEAKER_00]: these bottles containing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing you notice is on the
synthetic one, the water comes out all
[SPEAKER_00]: muddy, high in turbidity, dark and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of that water moved
right through that soil into the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the far right one, which is a pure
organic soil, the water that came out was
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal clear, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, there was only a little
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that soil held the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also cleaned the water and made it
suitable for drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the effect of all of the
disturbing of soil that we're doing right
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then adding in synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it recharging the groundwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's destroying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worse yet, we're pumping out of an
aquifer that took millions of years to
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sucking out so much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Tucson, Arizona dropped by 60
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Midwest has dropped by 40 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to that point, once you drop
and crush an aquifer, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming back for another million,
two million years until the whole process
[SPEAKER_00]: starts over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not cleaning our water through
our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're draining it out of an aquifer that
we cannot fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, a good friend of
mine, Dr. Kevin Fitzsimmons, who works at
[SPEAKER_00]: the U of A, University of Arizona,
was called in to deal with the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: the aquifer was collapsing down in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were piping in water from
Southern California in these giant canals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the canals were getting clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they needed to put fish in there to
try to chew up all this plant matter
[SPEAKER_00]: that's growing in the canals because
they're running water through a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was there to advise on how to
get this organic matter cleaned up out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's introduced, I believe they were grass
carp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as being a part of this whole system,
he was exposed to this water cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found out that the water company
had decided to pump that water that was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, I think it's the Colorado
River, one of them, pump it down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: aquifer to prevent the aquifer from
collapsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's lay a placeholder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what it did?
[SPEAKER_00]: It remineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they introduced different pH,
different minerals, and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, all the pipes that are
buried underground are now rotting and
[SPEAKER_00]: sending up chunks of metals and minerals
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pour a glass of water down in Tucson,
Arizona, and it's black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all filled with particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroyed the aquifer by trying to
fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what man does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just makes a mess out of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to soils and how critical it is
for life and how we're ignoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just pissing all over it and not
thinking ahead about like, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we leaving behind?
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is, hey, this planet was a
radioactive waste a million years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: or excuse me, a few billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, no matter what we do to it,
there's already been six extinctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be another one and it'll come
back just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, if we want to move
forward as a species and not just wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves out, we better start thinking
about soil, water, and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all starts from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump ahead a little bit,
because I could listen to you talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular part for hours,
but we don't have time for all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's bring it back towards the
specific point of growing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: these soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump ahead to agriculture,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what kind of an impact did
agriculture have on the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soils in the United States versus how it
was prior to agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And give us the smaller version of this
epic tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me, where is the most fertile
soils on the planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, oh, the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how big it is and how much it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, no, actually it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most fertile soil on the planet is
actually a meadow, is the prairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter that's allowed to build
up is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 20, 30 feet deep of just rich
organic matter that's formed in layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a dust storm blows a little dust,
and then so you get a layer of dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a heavy torrential
downpour, and this area washes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: creates mud, and that puts another layer
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants growing and dying,
growing and dying, growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all of the nutrients you
possibly can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a man gets in there and plows open
a section.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, woohoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the corn I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the carrots I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the potatoes I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how amazing this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they keep growing in that same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty soon they notice, well,
the plants aren't as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yielding as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go plow open a new section of the
prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what agriculture does is strip the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually begin to cave in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plants won't grow there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it so hard, so bad,
that we created the dust bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna do it again real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you fix that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the proper form of agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is showing people how
to continuously year after year produce
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing results from the same piece of
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love Sir Edward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what was his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a guy from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about early soil respect and how
you need to leave 50% behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna grow corn, figure you
take 50% of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of that corn you chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the minerals and nutrients for
next year's season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't do that, if you just keep
taking and taking and taking, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped all the nutrients out of the soil
and left a dust bowl behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's essentially at the heart of,
we talk about regenerative agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially about regenerative cannabis
agriculture on this show a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where you have brought us up to,
this is the heart of the whole game right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spot on, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go to our first commercial,
there's one more thing I wanna talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit of a non sequitur,
but I wanna talk about peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of folks who teach
organic cannabis growing who for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason think that we can use peat moss and
they recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always believed that,
I've got bogs where I live here on Vashon
[SPEAKER_01]: Island and they're very, very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's always been my belief that we
should not be using any peat moss because
[SPEAKER_01]: they come from bogs that have taken
thousands of years to build and it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerating resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's the real biologist take on
peat moss?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an excuse to use this throughout
cannabis like we are or do we need to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up and realize that this is not a resource
we should be using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be fooling around with peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a triple negative, Django.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the peat bogs are a water
cleansing source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, they're a carbon sink and a
really, really big carbon sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And third of all, they're an ecosystem in
their own self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've destroyed an ecosystem,
you've destroyed a water cycle system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've released a ton of carbon into
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't replace it in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the bogs in England have all been shut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've stopped all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not removing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not using any more peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody across the surface of the
earth should do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, interestingly enough, I met a
gentleman, Mont Hadley, years ago down at
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodeale or through Rodeale somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was creating this product called
pit moss, which I loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically shredded newspaper as
a vehicle for explosive root growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, for every kind of
potting, the flower industry, starter
[SPEAKER_00]: plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to start reusing a closed loop,
use newspapers and cardboard, grind it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make this substrate that would be
ideal for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unfortunately, he got shark tanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got all kinds of investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've taken it in other directions
to the point where now they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: making bedding for horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other animals, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reusing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some studies with them early on
with plant growth down at the Phipps
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservatory down in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to figure out how to
be more regenerative in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: setting because they have these beautiful
displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they got trees and bushes from all
over the world in this botanical garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to be more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they needed to grow these container
plants fast because every three months
[SPEAKER_00]: they change over the whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were looking for fast production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking for an alternative to
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to get into soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I introduced my soil biology
into their pit moss, my soil biology
[SPEAKER_00]: basically did the same thing when you
introduce more than 20% biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria in the biology just said,
hey, I don't need nothing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to live on this newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to work for you,
Mr. Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got everything I need right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing happens with biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology goes right to that biochar and
just sets up camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not interested in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not interested hanging out in the
Riosphere and helping the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a delicate balance to finding a
solution to peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved coconut core.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started to see how unregulated
and regenerative the techniques were and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross-contamination, the salts,
packaging, shipping it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think people have to start building
their own solution to peat moss and
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely stop buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stop buying it now, you'll slow
down the destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not stop the destruction because
they'll keep making this stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: stacking it up as high as they can,
figuring that sooner or later someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come and buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to stop that is going to take years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't stop now, we're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've heard me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm praying to God that we make such an
impact in the regenerative cannabis world
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rest of Ag across the planet
starts going, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we using synthetics only to have
to use pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't we looking at plant health and
regenerative focus toward not destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet, but enhancing it, making it
better for the next generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: chopping and dropping 50% so that it don't
destroy the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kinds of practices, but oh,
please stop using peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just triple killing the planet by
using that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for making it very painfully
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to implement these biological
solutions, real science education is
[SPEAKER_01]: vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing, you will probably want
[SPEAKER_01]: to attend this year's science of organic
regenerative cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the third year in a row, co-founders
Joshua Rutherford of Dutch Blooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton Morrison of Kingdom Aquapana have
lined up an incredible array of educators
[SPEAKER_01]: with all new content for the traveling
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling it version 2.0,
going deeper down their rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's teaching staff includes Elaine
Ingham on soil biology, Chris Trump and
[SPEAKER_01]: Wendy Kornberg talking Korean natural
farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelly and Josh from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, Suzanne Wainwright, the bug
[SPEAKER_01]: lady, Chip Osborne on soil chemistry,
and many other thought leaders rotating in
[SPEAKER_01]: and out for different cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consult the website to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a breeding panel,
a Q&A panel with the entire teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: staff, and on Saturday night, there will
be a bubble hash discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua has built in significant informal
time for you with the teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also no advertising during the
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only vendor booths are for cannabis
seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tuition is what's paying the staff,
so they all be present and attentive to
[SPEAKER_01]: you, not a corporate agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conference is not just for folks on
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt California is hosting one event
for sure, but the show is going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine, and Whitmore Lake,
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out your pen now because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized, top-shelf soil educators all
in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an intensive for people like us
who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: and growing and living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you attended last year,
be assured that this year is not simply a
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat of last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every speaker will present different
material than they did last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, tickets will be limited in a
number to preserve the intimate experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and will only be sold in advance online.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be no ticket sales at the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't wait and miss out on your chance
to attend this important gathering of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_01]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing that makes you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we covered a lot
of area and traveled through many years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and during second set, we're gonna bring
it on home to how you can use this
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leighton, let's start at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most everybody is using
containers still for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna talk about the soil and
the ground, but let's start because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you approach soil structure in
containers different than anybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come across because most everybody
has got like their soil recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put out a big ass tarp, you put down
whatever your base soil is gonna be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you throw your amendments in it,
you mix it up, you put it in the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: shazam, off you go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like with, you know, over longer
term, hopefully you're not throwing away
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil every year, and you're reusing
it, and that can become no-till,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But your approach is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always talking about building
layers in the containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hand you the floor, and I would like
you to teach us why you find that to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more effective and appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I biomimic natural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I look at anything is like,
all right, well, how did nature do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature did it by layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're called soil horizons,
and we were fortunate enough to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: time to do a quick video where you're
gonna put it up on YouTube, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to go look at it,
and we're gonna talk specifically a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, well, touch base on the horizons
and why they're so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diving right in, I tell cannabis
people, you know, you guys have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and yeah, it works, but it's
unsustainable because you basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using salt, or organic nudes,
you're burning the soil out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding too much of some stuff,
because each phenotype or chemotype pulls
[SPEAKER_00]: different things out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you strip this, and now you try to grow
the same plant, well, it's not gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: well in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to figure this out,
it gets really deep, it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: biological chemistry, phenotype,
chemotype, understanding the cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your soil, your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is much hotter out here in
northern Washington than it is out east.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say to these cannabis guys,
I'm like, yeah, you know, you build these
[SPEAKER_00]: new packs, you build these, you know,
what I wanna call organic matter level,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, O-horizon, that's what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just building the O-horizon for
your plant, and it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around for quite a while,
and this technique has been around for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is it's unsustainable,
and you have to dump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get two years out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, no, no, no, let's copy
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm recently working on a project
in Colorado, a good size grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he contacts me, or I got brought in
because of the other consultants involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they asked me, all right, well,
how are we gonna build the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, it's the same way
nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And explained the horizons to them,
and I said, you know, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is your budget for soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like a quarter of a
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna save you about $200,000 by doing
it this way, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got his attention pretty damn quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, all right, we're gonna,
first of all, we're gonna build an
[SPEAKER_00]: alluvial horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically just rocks and a
little bit of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that only has to be a couple inches
thick, and it's right at the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're gonna build an A-horizon,
and an A-horizon is gonna have sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: silt, and clay, and some organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can get into the percentages,
but they vary depending on what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't source material in the
East Coast and have it shipped to the
[SPEAKER_00]: West.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to wherever you are, and I find what
your local sources are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all clay is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are clays that have absolutely zero
nutritional value and are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have a magnetic charge,
cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what fuels that, is that electrical
charge, that magnetism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I source these local ingredients,
and I blend the sand, silt, and clay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and organic matter to a certain
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that is your A-horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the top is your O-horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're back into your guys' mixes,
where you're using rice hulls,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using peat moss, which please don't
use anymore, compost, and other organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what happens is that,
what happens is when you water that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, the A-horizon below it
will actually wick out excess moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that soil just never gets
anaerobic, that O-horizon, that organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone's ever played with a
tremendous amount of compost, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: how much moisture that stuff will hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab a handful of it and squeeze
it, and literally get the water to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it, out of your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have pure organic matter is a real
problem, because you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic pockets that you can't control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worse yet, jumping into the biology
side of it, what happens to bacteria when
[SPEAKER_00]: they are on a very moist environment,
is as that moisture wicks out,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria does something called cyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what a cyst is, is when a
bacteria forms a wax coating around the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of itself, and it pulls the
moisture and the food it needs inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider it a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can get into the physics behind the
bubble, and how it forms, but that's too
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the bacteria forms this wax
coating around its outside, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening exponentially, around the
outside of that organic matter as it dries
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you just created a vapor barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just created a way for that water to
not penetrate back into the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have anaerobic pockets,
and now you have hydrophobic soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant can't access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've melted your roots in the
anaerobic zone, so now you've made your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've eliminated the plant from being
able to use the organic matter on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides, and potentially on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people are building pots,
what I tell them is, you really need a
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor barrier around the sides of that pot
so that there's no way that it can go
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture level inside that pot is
staying at that moisture level that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using an O-Horizon, which you
have to, you need to mulch the top of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: either with a living mulch or some kind of
hay or some kind of bark, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: won't allow the air to wick that moisture
out, to steal that humidity that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep in there for the plant and
for the Riosphere and for all the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to have a way for that water
excess to drain out of it, and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: A-Horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is, the A-Horizon prevents
fines, we call them fines, little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: particulates of sand, silt, and clay from
getting down in there and creating what we
[SPEAKER_00]: would call a compaction zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a compaction zone is where moisture and
water cannot move through that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets trapped at that zone,
and the roots come down, they hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, and bam, oh man, it's anaerobic,
it melts my root tips, now I'm gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: an infection, now I'm gonna have a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's so important that you
allow moisture to move all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: these pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alluvial layer at the bottom,
will take up any excess moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the A-Horizon will wick the excess
moisture out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, they all work together
to create this magic called moisture water
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles moving through gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually I've just been sitting here
with my eyes closed, just listening to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and picturing these different layers,
and it all fits together like this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful melody, but I do have questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first one, to clarify, when you're
talking about building these layers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, I believe you described three
layers, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a sand and stone layer on the
bottom, and then you've got a silt layer
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle, and then on the top you've
got what we would normally be our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I close, or am I still far off?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you're kind of close, but the
A-Horizon is not silt, it's sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: silt, clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sand, silt, and clay, and organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some organic matter in
there too, and it's just a percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 17% clay, 13% silt,
50% sand, and that leaves, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%, and that would have been the organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of all the recipes that I've
experimented with and such to build up my
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge base, I've never gone out and
bought clay or silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What actually do I go to either A,
in a perfect world, wildcraft?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I go out and wildcraft?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, more realistically for most people,
what do I go to the nursery or
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture store and buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard of a bag of silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wildcraft it, and basically what you
do is you go to one of my favorite places
[SPEAKER_00]: to go shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the golf course industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are building high-performance
soils, they bring in stuff from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place, and they generally will know,
like, hey, I'm building a golf course in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area, so they'll contact all the
local sand pits, quarries, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to the local contractors to find some
of these sources so that then they can
[SPEAKER_00]: locally harvest the material, blend it
together, and build their high-performance
[SPEAKER_00]: sports fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I never really thought about it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that you're describing is all
absolutely necessary information for golf
[SPEAKER_01]: courses, because that's essentially what
they're selling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling you perfect ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if they're going to make perfect
ground, they've got to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are not making wetlands or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wouldn't want to ship this stuff
in from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's super expensive, so they're
going to be finding it locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are actual companies that serve
the golf courses in different regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that would be where we'd want to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, you have
extremely fertile soil out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the volcanoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is made through two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, volcanic ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is a glacier pushing through and
grinding rock against rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find clay locally either
sometimes I'll reach out to a pottery
[SPEAKER_00]: company, especially if they're like a
regenerative pottery company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, oh, yeah, we have different
local sources of clay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we blend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just use it naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good resource for clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all you really got to do is dig a
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got clay in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be how I would source my
clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other way to source your silt
is, again, understanding how silt was
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt is just organic matter ground up to
the finest possible molecule, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a humate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt is bigger than a humate, but it would
soon become humate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're talking about forest
duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, forest duff is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt would come from a riverbed,
the bottom of a lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have, say, a pool that's defunct
and filled with algae and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that are rotting on the bottom of
it, that's silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's organic matter digesting itself and
turning into humates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's first silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always go to water sources to find my
silt, like creeks, or old areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: old washouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite places is, and this is
the beauty of God or the universe,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia, whatever you believe in,
but where the rivers meet the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Estuaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, it's all silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell people, if you're going
to wildcraft, you better wildcraft
[SPEAKER_00]: respectfully, or you're going to get
zammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get with zapped by Gaia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to bitch slap you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better bring in, if you're going to
go in and get a couple five gallon buckets
[SPEAKER_00]: of this stuff, you damn well better bring
in a couple five gallon compound buckets
[SPEAKER_00]: of compost or an offering of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you're going to end up
harvesting some bad stuff and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you have to
understand about wildcrafting silt is it
[SPEAKER_00]: is anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you ever walk down the side of a
river and stepped into the mud and sunk up
[SPEAKER_00]: to your knee, and then you pull your foot
out and it smells like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that silt has to be blended with a
tremendous amount of more dry organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter or dry clay so that that can wick
the moisture out of it and begin to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I do in my job,
I harvest fish manure from different
[SPEAKER_00]: fisheries and aquaculture and aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I have to do is
aerobically stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kill off the shigilla, I kill off all
the spireum, spirillum, and the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that is through increased dissolved
oxygen in the water column.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to build up the oxygen in that
water as fast and as hard as I possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can to kill all that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every batch is different and I have to use
a microscope to determine that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: that DO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can use a DO meter, but it
doesn't mean that I've gotten rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That DO meter is just telling me that I'm
in my ballpark, but now I have to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: and wait until that conversion happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from anaerobic to aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a gray area in the middle too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could really dive deep on that in
itself, but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the silt has to become aerobic as quick
as possible or you're going to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wild-crafting silt,
understand that you have to use your
[SPEAKER_00]: common sense and be really responsible
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found some sources of silt through
excavators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh yeah, I was digging over here
and I found this layer of black shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go over there and now that layer
has had the moisture wicked out from the A
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon underneath of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been aerobically stabilized
through gravity and time, Gaia's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to do it, but the
easiest, quickest source is usually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be creeks, rivers, streams,
old lake beds, swamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to get your
silt.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about the bottom
layer, I think you called it the alluvial
[SPEAKER_01]: layer, and that's where the rocks are.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size of rocks are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about rocks the size of the
palm of your hand that are pretty big or
[SPEAKER_01]: are you talking about more like pebbles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use all of them, so everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're limited like the gentleman
in Colorado, my alluvial layer is only
[SPEAKER_00]: four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could not use something the size of
your palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I told him was we sourced out a
local quarry that grinds rocks up and
[SPEAKER_00]: makes gravels and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sourced out a material called inch
and a half minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that is is that's going to be
rocks that are the biggest rock you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: is inch and a half, but it's going to be
minus all the way down to sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically that's the way alluvial layer
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you go to the beach,
you go out to Vashon Island, you go out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the beach, you see all the big rocks on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you dig down, you're going to start
to see smaller and smaller and smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks and sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of clay and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, biomimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, all right, just let's use the
inch and a half minus because that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is you're going to
you're going to layer this stuff in and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to just briefly water it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to notice the sand goes
right to the bottom and the rocks kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: come up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's now part of your filtration
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to it's going to allow the
water to pull into those pots and rockets
[SPEAKER_00]: in between all of the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sand is going to help to wick it
out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you've got to leave your
beds, leave a little cracked space at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of your bed so any excess water
will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to use a little
filter fabric or something to prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: sand from oozing out if you want it to be
really neat and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy was he he wants to when he
walks down his rows, he doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see any little sand slipping out from
underneath his boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his his that was his idea to add the
filter fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first I was like, don't add
anything you don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to you want this place
to look sterile and nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want, you know, find oozing out
from underneath the sides of your beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually he would have to
replace that in the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might as well just keep it
where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we go to our second commercial,
let's do one nice thumbnail summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm hearing you correctly,
my first layer that's going to be three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four inches is going to be, you know,
inch or two size stone all the way down to
[SPEAKER_01]: very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, two inches all the way
down to minus I think is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: vocabulary you were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then my my middle layer is
going to be sand, silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've already talked about how we can
we can get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then our top layer is going
to be whatever our preferred living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mix that we would normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you build this layer cake in every
single pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you forgot was the organic
matter number in the horizon of 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter to write on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I guess while we're adding that
the the green mulch to this is the first
[SPEAKER_01]: year that I ran tests using, you know,
like little grasses and clovers on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's wildly different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've I've gotten a hydrophobic
layer on top of my pots for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and by midseason, the water is running
off the sides of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, actually, especially the
the radishes I use that only in Ingham
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got all these little plants
and they all create all of these pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: for the water to go down into the
substrate of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also creates like this mini
rainforest and and keeps the the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the top of the pot moisture or moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I never get that closed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that would be your top layer than a
green mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the living mulches because
you guys are all big fans of Riosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand how important they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those those little micro roots coming
out of those little micro greens or living
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches are sending out miles of Riosphere
and those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all your nutrient cycling is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plan is getting those Riosphere,
getting those organic organisms to do its
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when that root crosses over
the root hair of a cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an exchange that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they talk and they give each other
nutrients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this one wants that, hey,
I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll trade you for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's that's the way nature
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that living mulch on the top is
critical to preventing hydrophobic to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow out the Riosphere and
building soil tilth and structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as as the critical communication
that that happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you guys just grow one plant in
there, you've isolated the poor thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how is it supposed to communicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it supposed to become fully hit its
full potential when you've you've limited
[SPEAKER_00]: it to no no buddies, no friends,
no no family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again, this is why I love
dragonfly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the message that they're bringing
forward is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't isolate a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomimic nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do that, the results are
insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're night and day from what you're
used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, let's go ahead and take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is soil biologist
Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivators who grow and living soil are
very particular on what inputs they use in
[SPEAKER_01]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They educate themselves and painstakingly
create compost and nutritive teas to
[SPEAKER_01]: create thriving soils that will produce
the very best expression of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many living soil farmers now believe that,
over time, seeds become acclimated to the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of substrate they are grown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a seed that was bred in
synthetic fertilizers may not immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to do in a living soil
environment, slowing their growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: decreasing yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regenerative seed cooperative is a
different kind of seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regenerative seed cooperative only
provide cannabis seeds that were bred in
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil and using probiotic growing
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, when you germinate in soil,
the seeds' genetic will recognize the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and immediately start
interacting with microbes and fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds are described as
bio-intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of cannabis breeders
participating in the regenerative seed
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative is rapidly increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already signed on are
[SPEAKER_01]: With more being added every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds are A significant amount of
the profits go to cannabis seed
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation projects available to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to take every advantage that
you can when growing in beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then consider buying your seeds from the
regenerative seed cooperative at
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's regenerativeseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skinny-dipping, humpback whales,
beatnik poetry, the Ottoman Empire,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil remediation, interdimensional beings,
and tree frogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just a few of the interesting
topics you can find in the audiobooks
[SPEAKER_01]: library at audible.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leighton, let's jump right back into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the last set, we talked about how
to properly use these horizon layers in
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are growing outside
now more than ever because people are
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to grow their particular number of
plants for THC-based cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we've got all these people using
these fields now to grow medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the same concepts of
using the horizons, but let's assume
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any type of situation where I'm in a
field growing outdoors, first thing I do
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's called a perk test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I dig a hole and I look at
the soil horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pour a five gallon bucket of
water in there and I hit the timer and I
[SPEAKER_00]: watch and I wait to see how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that water does not drain out of that
soil pretty quickly, you got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's pretty quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that five gallons doesn't dry,
doesn't go dry within a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have what would be considered a
compaction zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm doing a perk test,
I dig a big hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking like a little,
you know, 10 scoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a trench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get down and see those horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how deep my O horizon is,
how deep my A horizon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's typically a B horizon,
which we didn't touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's an alluvial layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sometimes there's alluvial layer
underneath the B and sometimes there's
[SPEAKER_00]: bedrock under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all these things are important to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically tell people, you know,
dig a hole as deep as you think the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is a 14 foot monster,
you better believe those roots are going
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 feet in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might need a backhoe, you might
need an excavator, but you got to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: it methodically like you were biomimicking
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing in the world you can do is
dig a hole, throw in a bunch of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter and plant a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is if that's going
to turn anaerobic, all that O horizon is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do is suck the moisture out of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's going to be a,
the fines are going to migrate and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to create a like a, like a clay
kettle for the plant and the plants not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if my soil doesn't drain and I
don't see the right layering that I need,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I build a horizon on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I know if it's raining and
it's pouring and we get this extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, which people, hello, we're going
to get extreme weathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lightning in fricking North pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had lightning out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is going to be extreme and
they, by extreme, I mean extreme rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is extreme rain and your plant
is in a cauldron, it's going to fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: and kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to make sure that you're
looking at drainage and that's a big piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your soil doesn't drain,
you got to dig another hole a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher until you see that water disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water doesn't disappear and your
soil is pure clay based and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: drain, then you got to build on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these giant commercial hemp fields,
if you're talking big ag, they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed the aggregate so bad that it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to puke synthetics on
it and then tons of pesticides to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the pests at bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, I don't even want to go down that
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stay focused on what your
existing soil system is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your soil does not drain,
then you have to start terracing and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a number of different ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love, you know, finding dead wood
on the property and using that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of my raised bed because it does two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides fungal food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides insulation and protection from
the sides getting hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's, it's, it's, it's
regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you're not, you're not taking or
destroying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just using something that was
already present, but you're using it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different manner than it was intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the log in the, in the woods,
the fall, we call them blowdowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's serving a purpose to the forest,
but it can also serve you a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not like harvesting new
trees, I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why not use these logs to raise your
beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you're going to try to do
commercial ag in this method, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's not really cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your field doesn't drain and you've
got water, squishy ground, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to find another piece
of land if you want to go big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you buy anything, you know,
you really got to do your homework on this
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand our, was there synthetics
used there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's going to be some issues
if there was, that was, if that was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of farmed commercially and non
regenerative over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is the fungi will tie up some
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will get broken down on
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit more about
rehabbing soil in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, but you know, the, the goal here
is to find a place suitable for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the soil is functioning in a
proper way that it will allow you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds to me like when we move
outside and we're actually in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: the moral of the story is find out whether
or not your, your soil can remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture by doing a percolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you, if you are doing,
you know, craft or your home grow and your
[SPEAKER_01]: perc test fails, well, you're going to
have to build a raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are trying to do, you know,
you know, agriculture, multiple acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it fails the perc test, you just got
to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so, so you figure out that
option and then either, and if your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your ground succeeds, in the perc test,
whether, and you're at home or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing craft, well, then that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just dig a hole and then you follow
the recipe that you laid out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizons that we talked about in the
second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to be honest with you,
all you really need to do in that case is
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the top 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it typically, you want,
you want this plant to get
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want its roots to go down and out to
the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give it the ability to grow
really quickly and bust a move.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, as soon as it gets
to the sides where your organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't there anymore, you want it to start
weaving itself easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the indigenous plants that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really need to dig a huge
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to see the horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to understand what your soil
system is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do want a perc at a lower level as
well as a top level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really getting a good feeling
of, of what this plant is going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're exposing this plant to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really realized the importance of
the perc test before, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess that's probably because
I've, I've mostly grown in containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my God, I can imagine people listening
who have purchased their land to do
[SPEAKER_01]: medical hemp and it's overly wet and
they're realizing, Oh my God, I didn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: a perc test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and now their choices are either A,
spend several seasons and lots of money
[SPEAKER_01]: rehabbing the land or they've got to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a pretty heavy duty thing
to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the earth moves in
geological time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And investment capital, even less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you've, you've explained to us how
that we can, we can redo these horizons in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before, before we wrap up for the day,
I want to make sure we talk about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: rehabilitate, you know, maybe we'll talk
about rehabbing land a bit, but we all
[SPEAKER_01]: have this experience of having a,
being at the end of the season and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and our, and our pots are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some people will go and
they'll, they'll put them on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in one part of the property and they'll
stack them, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll create all this compaction or
they'll put them in a barn somewhere and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll get like ridiculously dry and,
and all the microbes will die out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of people who cut the
pots and they just leave them all out to
[SPEAKER_01]: nature so they can stay, you know,
ferociously alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so why don't you hit a couple of the,
the, the, the, the challenges that you see
[SPEAKER_01]: most often, uh, that need to be rehabbed
and, and give us an idea of how to go
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'm not a big fan of pots
and rather everybody being raised beds
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can do what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could bio mimic in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls all the organic matter falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an insulation layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's insulating the soil from freezing
like a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in New England, we get four feet of
frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't going to work out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I would say to people is put
your pots all together and just bury them
[SPEAKER_00]: in leaves and hay so that you have that
organic matter rotting around your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping it moist, keeping it warm,
keeping it moist, preventing it from
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it does get frost, that's not the
end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, in New England,
our ground freezes four feet deep and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass comes back in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the forest, the ground never
freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they did an interesting study a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it about they, they basically kind
of cut all the trees down in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they, they measured the
biology and the ups and downs in both the
[SPEAKER_00]: area they cut it down and then the area
where they didn't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that the area that they
didn't touch really never froze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was always some biological
activity, um, even when the snow was piled
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, the snow was
another insulator and they went so far in
[SPEAKER_00]: this experiment as to actually plow the
snow off the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got exposed to freezing and the wind
and it was radically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they lost huge, huge colonies and
diversity in the soil because it froze
[SPEAKER_00]: solid and it didn't have any kind of
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have any kind of rotten rotting,
um, or mulching or, or composting that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I would say take your pots and if
you want to leave them where they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause they're too big to move,
then you want to build a compost pile
[SPEAKER_00]: around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, or, um, again, you don't
want to put a tarp over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to let them dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let them be exposed to the
diversity of the environment because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to help the organisms that
you need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spoil them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep them, you know,
exposed to some of this, but you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect the pots, keep them warm,
keep them alive, um, so that in spring
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you let them dry out, now you've
created all of those cysts and those cysts
[SPEAKER_00]: are a bitch to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had some fun back in my early
days screwing around with a desert
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant and people go, Oh, that's
desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The desert is amazingly fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a desert one day and it's dries
a bone and then the monsoon comes in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you come back the next day and it's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how green it turns in 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works because that soil,
um, system, and the biology are used to
[SPEAKER_00]: these extremes, but yours aren't your,
your soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would take some of this inoculant
and I throw it in water and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: literally float for, for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like sand, silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like, you know, sand and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was coarse and rough and I throw it
in the vial in the test too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could look at the biology in it and
this shit would be floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called Elaine one day and I was
like, Elaine, what the, what is up with
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was, she, you got to give it time
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll, it'll eventually sink and then you
can look at the biology, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just blew my mind that earth could
float on water, but that was the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in your system,
your bacteria and your biology are not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they cyst up, it's going to take a long
time for them to rehydrate and come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that system, start to work for you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is why I'm saying, you know,
protect the pots with hay and straw and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves so that they have that buffer,
but they're not just completely exposed or
[SPEAKER_00]: unexposed to the extremes of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're suggesting that
really what the, the best way to rehab is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually to do preventative because once,
once your hydro runs, your pots have gone
[SPEAKER_01]: cyst and have become hydrophobic,
you might as well break down the pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: start over again because breaking down the
pot and starting over is going to be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier and might even, you know,
make more biological sense as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of trying to undo what has already
been locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the other thing is that if you're
going to go that way, I would highly
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that you compost that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like don't just throw it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a layer of it so that it's being
exposed to the moisture underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let, let the grasses grow up through
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let it, let, give it back to nature in
a responsible, uh, method because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I know guys that, that,
that try to reuse their soil, reuse their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but the nutrients have been stripped
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, unless you want to pay,
you know, 15, 20, 30 bucks to test each
[SPEAKER_00]: pot to see what was stripped out of it by
your cannabis plant, cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's worse than corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks the nutrients right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of you guys in the
past had made these new packs to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your organic matter, um, to make sure the
plant had access to all the things it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's not regenerative because now
you're buying bags of stuff that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from all over the world and
somewhere, someone machines crushing and
[SPEAKER_00]: stripping this earth and creating scars to
hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, silt and clay and biology and
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you prevent it from stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pots, you've stripped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've stripped out everything you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're going to have to replace
those, those minerals, which are expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: to get and expensive to test to find out
which ones you need to replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's finish up with a little bit
of talk about no-till because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think I'm hearing you saying is
that you're not actually, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually believe that the, the no-till
system, um, is regenerative because the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will use the nutrients that is in
the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yet you're not a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm get, I mean, you think I'm hearing of,
of add, you know, adding amendments,
[SPEAKER_01]: top dressing, and then watering them in
because you're saying that these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these amendments are often taken from
other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but what can we do perhaps to widen
the gap between wild craft locally and top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress so that we can keep these mature
systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I love starting the year with a,
an already mature mycelium, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, system in the pot and everything
seems to thrive more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if we were doing no-till and we
didn't want to ship in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic stuff like seabird guano from
islands and stuff, um, like what,
[SPEAKER_01]: how should we think about using no-till
but wild crafting locally?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went down a rabbit hole, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got another hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you can do it in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do this one quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different things going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, um, that mycelium,
all right, first of all, let's start with
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, no-till is soil is fields,
not pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've struggled really hard with trying to
think of a pot as, as no-till as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as, you know, regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if, if, if you can ever not
amend that at some point in your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear you on the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mycelium you're seeing is called
saprophytic fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're part of a whole,
the whole soil food web and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very important purpose and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of that is the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a, that is a fungi that works
directly for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the plant cells and it's pulling
nutrients from outside and bringing them
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the internal side of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, if you till, you lose your
mycelium, you lose your mycorrhizae every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 90 days to colonize, um,
mycorrhizae, which means it takes 90 days
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it up and running fully functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the time you're harvesting your
plant for some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is it that you can get that
colonization to occur in that pot and then
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and hopefully the mycorrhizae spore
out and that they're still there so that
[SPEAKER_00]: next season when you plug in your plant,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know is that's, that's going
to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have yet to see anybody,
you know, do some test studies to see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that mycorrhizae over wintered in
that pot without a host of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's one interesting piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the saprophytic will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll, over winter without a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I get the whole understanding of
like, I like my pot ready to go in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, that's where I go back to
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you build a compost pile on top and
around of that pot, then you've maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: all your microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you, if you can find a,
perhaps a small, um, conifer that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could plant in there so that there was
some root systems that are still moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that there was something still living
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, when it came time to
spring, you'd have to either rip that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing out or cut it so that, um,
you could grow your cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of the only way I can ever
like try to, to think that that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative method to growing in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to continue to bust my head
open on this, to try to figure out a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can tell people, right,
if you do this to your pot, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be fine in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I just haven't had the time and,
and the money to do the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and the testing, um, to really prove
that or, or come up with a method to doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of just shooting from the hip
here with, with this and brainstorming
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's, that's the direction
I'd go is find something that I can put in
[SPEAKER_00]: that pot that's living and mulch it like
it would be in a, in a forest so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, you know, thoroughly freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it freezes for a day or two,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't freeze all the way through like
a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess that would be, that would be
my suggestion for, for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, thank you for ending the show
with a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I, I kind of thought I knew
what the, the no-till litany was I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get from you and you went a
totally surprising direction, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the reasons I was excited to have you
on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so Leighton Morrison, thank you so
much for sharing your vast experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more than that, your passion,
man, because, you know, there are a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of times when you're all times you made
the hair on the back of my neck,
[SPEAKER_01]: stand up just because I could feel how
excited and how, you know, passionate you
[SPEAKER_01]: are about this and, and it really came
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you, you represent a very unique
perspective and, uh, we're all fortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: to have been able to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to talk with you
and I'm looking forward to chopping it up
[SPEAKER_00]: some more with you in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to hear more from Leighton
Morrison, there's a couple of ways you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first way you can do that is when,
uh, Leighton was explaining the different
[SPEAKER_01]: horizons, there is a particular image that
he uses in his slide presentation that is
[SPEAKER_01]: really helpful in understanding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he has provided that to me and we
recorded a, a video a couple of weeks ago
[SPEAKER_01]: at my house and, uh, he goes through it in
a little more detail while you can look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that slide, since this is a podcast and
you can't actually see the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free, feel free to jump over to the
Shaping Fire YouTube channel and check
[SPEAKER_01]: that video out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm posting it the same day that this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, number two, if you want to,
uh, you know, follow along, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and see what Leighton's up to,
or if you want to drop him a message,
