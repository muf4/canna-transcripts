[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like there are people shuffling
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: As she said, my name is Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it feel like 8 o'clock in the
morning still?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here to talk to you today about
cannabis breeding, biotechnology,
[SPEAKER_04]: turkeys, flavors, and taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to do so, I kind of have to tell some
stories, because I don't know if there are
[SPEAKER_04]: any plant breeders in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, hire.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all hired.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people use cannabis in here?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times am I going to raise your
hand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this isn't going to be deep into
plant breeding and informatics.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we want to get into that, I'll bring
Ryan Lee up afterwards, and we can explore
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is more just kind of an overview
of where the industry's going and how
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation is going to be a key segment in
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Previous to this event, we used to go to
hemp cons and NCIA and all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: places, where the biggest innovation from
the standpoint of the conference goer was
[SPEAKER_04]: a new trimmer or some extraction system
that they hijacked from a process that was
[SPEAKER_04]: already fine-tuned in pharma and applied
it to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess my point is there wasn't a
whole lot of innovation going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy LED lights, growth chambers,
all stuff that agriculture and the $1 a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound for conventional basil couldn't
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't spend $20 million capex on a
range of greenhouses if you don't plan to
[SPEAKER_04]: make $20 million in the first few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we're standing on this hill,
looking down at the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to think, what is the largest
segment in the market for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody know?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You must have heard my talk before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's kind of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest area of ever actual
innovation in this space was it isn't in
[SPEAKER_04]: technology per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in a different area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us to understand that area,
we have to think about the cultural
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective on the market and how it's
permeated through almost every sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the cultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I used to play Monopoly in
college on Fridays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, I played it at home with my
brothers and my family.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I went to Rose-Holman for the
first time where I got an undergrad in
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical engineering, the first Friday we
played Monopoly on a land, rolled the
[SPEAKER_04]: dice, land on Indiana Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, that's one auction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of this before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the next person's turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, no, don't you read the
directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here to be an engineer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't read the directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those rules were taught to me by my
family or by my culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an example of where somebody had
taken something that was more complex and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of oversimplified it and made it less
fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what the cannabis industry is
done in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not poking at anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the notion of higher THC is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The notion of holding your hit longer,
you'll get higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these things, those are all
cultural impacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to think that that's not the
best way to look at things, especially if
[SPEAKER_04]: the non-daily user is the biggest market
segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because those people aren't going to want
to feel weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to want to have
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to want to have,
where's my key keys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my phone?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you definitely don't want a mother of
two at a soccer game worrying about other
[SPEAKER_04]: mothers judging her for being high at that
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you innovate a little bit,
you can remove those feelings.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make this a lifestyle drug,
which is essentially where it's going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that cannabis as a plant can
cure anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it definitely could be applied.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a lifestyle drug, which is a huge
segment in pharma, whether it's anxiety
[SPEAKER_04]: or, again, as I said this yesterday,
if it's adult use or medical, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to think about this in the
grander scheme and step back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people don't even realize
that alcohol is one of the best
[SPEAKER_04]: painkillers on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've used it for years to treat pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a bottle that you buy at the
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another cultural impact is the indicative
notion, which I'll get into sooner or
[SPEAKER_04]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But based on that perspective,
the biggest innovation in cannabis in 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years has been THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been this linear growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year, it gets stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether it's correlated or not
correlated, I like to look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 1996, a group did a study.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at cannabis use, and we'll get to
the definition of cannabis shortly,
[SPEAKER_04]: and adverse events.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 1996, about 20% of cannabis users
experienced adverse events.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same study was done eight years later,
six years later, with an N of 10x that
[SPEAKER_04]: study.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% of users experienced adverse events.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you fast forward to the future
today, a lot of people are going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing a dab and getting a panic attack,
that's an adverse event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having heart palpitations, that's an
adverse event.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're essentially overdosing on a
compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more and more studies are coming out
supporting the notion that high THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: high CBD alone isn't as beneficial as the
two together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot like those old racy commercials
where the cop offers you Reese's Crashes
[SPEAKER_03]: into the thing, and you're like,
oh, you got my chocolate and your peanut
[SPEAKER_03]: butter, and you got my peanut butter and
your chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're better together, is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife would argue and say that
chocolate's better by itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The point is, there isn't a lot of
diversity in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we bridge that gap?
[SPEAKER_04]: Technological innovation in the space,
they don't exist, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to change that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this could be the conference
where it becomes more technology focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a new trimmer or an
extractor, as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are innovations that other
industries brought here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be novel plant types.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be resistance to pests and
disease and all of those things that we
[SPEAKER_04]: all are happily working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to the doctor, do they write you a
prescription for poppy?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a poppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take your cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be codeine for cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be morphine for pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clean for anticancer therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many compounds, one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis, today's medical program is,
here's a recommendation for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What chemicals are acting on your element
or your symptom?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times we don't know,
or as this generic indica versitiva thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to trigger anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's this misnomer that cannabis is
just a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a huge disconnect between
anecdotal reports of whether it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, it helped me with my pain,
or maybe Superman.
[SPEAKER_04]: There isn't corroboration on the research
side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to know why that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could be because the market's
homogenous.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: NIDA only offers THC on a lot of levels
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the research is impacted by the
marketplace and the culture because the
[SPEAKER_04]: culture says high THC, THC, THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has been the centric focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas all of us know nowadays CBD seems
to be this booming market of everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: wanting to buy it off Amazon so they can
find that cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But having said that, the way that
regulators look at this is very THC
[SPEAKER_04]: centric.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of see some of the universal
signs or symbols for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And five out of seven have THC right on
the logo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oregon, with their oversupply of 1.3
million pounds, they were very successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They trademarked their pop symbol so at
least they can make their money back
[SPEAKER_04]: licensing that symbol out to other
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have the, I can't deal with the
mayor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like reflecting off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the one without THC on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very forward looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have a product that doesn't
have THC in it, but it's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: product, and it has to have the THC logo
on it, I mean, that doesn't even match the
[SPEAKER_04]: FDA with them like that very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's this whole definition of
cannabis and we need to be careful with
[SPEAKER_04]: that because indicative is a cultural
concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a construct rooted in
anything other than our own culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before I get into the meat,
I just like remind everyone that in the
[SPEAKER_04]: past, it was closets, backdoor deals,
zero regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we're somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future, it's going to be regulated,
whether it's FDA, whether it's us,
[SPEAKER_04]: the DCC, whoever, someone needs to
regulate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all about public safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't to kill the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't to stop the movement,
but it's to make sure that people aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: putting adulterates in e-pens,
which happened recently for some CBD pens
[SPEAKER_04]: that were being spiked with synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to guarantee public safety because at
the end of the day, someone is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have to pick up the Medicare bill for kids
18 to 25, doing dads their whole life and
[SPEAKER_04]: causing some sort of brain harm by
overdosing the THC constantly every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not saying that that's going to happen,
but it's certainly a possibility,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if all you have to do is co-administer
a little CBD to mitigate those harms,
[SPEAKER_04]: why wouldn't you do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you still get all of the benefits and
all of the happiness and all of the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have a safety net there to
protect your brain, which is probably the
[SPEAKER_04]: most valuable organ you have, unless
you're a teenage boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd just like to tell a little story
about a person who came to us back in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2011, 2010, and she was looking for
something to get off of Fexor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fexor, Zoloft, and Paxil, she bounced
around between these anxiety medicines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, she was super stoked when
cannabis became legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was like, oh my gosh, here's an
alternative to a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she goes to the physician, the
physician writes her a recommendation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the recommendation is for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, well, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she says, well, the physician tells
her just don't smoke it, because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, smoking isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she goes to the dispensary,
and she's like, fucking candies,
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolates, woo!
[SPEAKER_04]: We know where this goes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was no CBD pens back there as a
rescue, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: She was painting on the walls with mustard
and calling me and saying, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we couldn't tell her to do anything
but just chill out and take a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she goes back to the dispensary,
because we're all like, well, try flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The animals weren't labeled all that well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still not labeled all that well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, weight percent doesn't really tell
you anything about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have a dosage amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every cultivar there could possibly
imagine, every painting you could possibly
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine on the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, well, what's good for
anxiety?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the budgetary's like, well,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the budgetary says, try an indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, what's an indica?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it has fat leaves, it grows short,
and it's sedative.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she tries an indica, and it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just basically anxiety and anxiousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, the dominant terpenes in the
marketplace, and I'm going kind of fast
[SPEAKER_04]: here to get to the part where it's cool
and innovative.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back then, in 2011, 3 quarters of the
market was mere seen dominant on the type
[SPEAKER_04]: one side in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of innovation has happened between
now, then, and now.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot more chemical diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: SC Labs have tested this the best since
they see the most number of tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was pretty homogenous then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, if you look at the Nature
article from January, about 98% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: products grown in Washington state were
high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 98% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different people types.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's 170 different salad
dressings, but there's only THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you hit all of those different
people types?
[SPEAKER_04]: And in flavor and fragrance, different
panels are decided by how they taste,
[SPEAKER_04]: not by some blind study where you look at
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have mutations.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're taste buds that don't allow them
to taste certain flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a huge segment of the
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're making products for the
masses, you have to look at all these
[SPEAKER_04]: different market segments and create
flavors and effects and things that are
[SPEAKER_04]: targeted, and not just, oh, we're going to
bang this out, high THC, make money,
[SPEAKER_04]: because this race to the bottom is going
to come to an end at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the toolbox for NIDA
and, again, this marketplace, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: limited.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have THC with different dominant
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for CBD, there's only pretty much one
dominant terpene, and that's Miracene.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some exceptions out in the
marketplace, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a homogenous product offering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Samantha was pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She gave up on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said the recoups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was all good until this pretty
guy got on the TV and started talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she had this new hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even my dad called.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, dude, you can sell me your
whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanjay said so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it took, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people got calls from their
parents saying it's cool?
[SPEAKER_04]: See?
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you guys are workers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanjay saved our great family.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then immediately after this,
everybody was like, CBD every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is what people said, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, Samantha was stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, fucking CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she went to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back then, there was only Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like buzz killer, not buzz giver.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you mix Miracene and CBD,
it's just like a deadly combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kill your buzz and make you depressed,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was her experience, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't like being in the cloud all
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: She actually preferred the pharmaceutical
solution for her problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is sad, because any time you can't
help someone, you always feel like you
[SPEAKER_04]: left something on the table and you need
to go back to the drawing boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But during this time, some clients of ours
were working towards something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me to explain that something,
I have to actually explain a way to
[SPEAKER_04]: visualize that something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a hat today that said, chemicals
kill cannabis heals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, isn't the camera
full of chemicals?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a machine gun blast of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be able to see all these chemicals,
whether it's the 17 terpenes or 13
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids that this phytofax report
outlines, we had to do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you got a test report from a
laboratory, that was essentially a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of lines in black and white with numbers
and letters like LOQ and whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary people, they didn't really
glean anything from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the market then would say,
hey, what's the strongest?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the highest THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me buy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a really insightful dispensary owner,
Andre Speciale, she asked specifically for
[SPEAKER_04]: a way to visualize the test results that
could be easy and intuitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we worked on this for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we color coded the terpenes
intuitively so that limonene is yellow,
[SPEAKER_04]: pining is green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically the warm tones on the
terpene profile, they instigate a
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa-like terpene high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just vaporize terpenes,
whether it's limonene, terpenylene,
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, you can totally feel the
effect of them if you have a concentration
[SPEAKER_04]: high enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically in high THC cannabis,
the THC pharmacology overwhelms the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get kind of this just high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you start adding CBD to the mix,
the terpene entourage kind of gets
[SPEAKER_04]: shuffled out and rises to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular example was classic perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I think the laser reflects
off the thing there, so it's pointless.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have flavor and aroma there that's
calculated from the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: The purple bar is mersine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have blue, big carotene, and then the
green is pining.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is indicative of any perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So perps is a category that we define by
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ends the name game.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have Ken's GDP, or purple or
purple, or classic perps, or even a blue
[SPEAKER_04]: dream, they fall in this kind of cassette
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, having said that, we can continue our
journey with Samantha, where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at this OG legend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty indicative OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hybrid of classic OG and classic
bubble cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limonene dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really great OG nose that pops in your
face, explodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a type one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the black circle,
it looks like a donut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Black is THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gray is the CBGA.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it's mostly THC, and it gives her
Frankenstein and sad things, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're in a greenhouse,
and you're having coffee going over,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're smoking type one, you're going
to get that adverse event, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was working for me just as much as I
was working for Samantha here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Lee is probably sick of giving me
hugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that volcano, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they showed that the delivery of THC
to the lungs is higher in a volcano than
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking was recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that explains a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you add a little CBD,
which this is a breeding technique,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the cannabis that breeds type two
in the industry has a ratio of THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: of one to two.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are reasons for this, and it's hard
to uncouple that correlation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we have greater than one THC to
CBD, which allows the THC to overwhelm the
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD contribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're familiar,
but this is my hand gesture of blood serum
[SPEAKER_04]: levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So THC, your smoke heads up, and you're
down fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you add CBD, it mellows the rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It prolongs the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're consuming a type two cannabis
that has two parts THC, the one part CBD,
[SPEAKER_04]: your high will actually last longer than
THC alone because of the pharmacology of
[SPEAKER_04]: the CBD in the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was still a little too edgy for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This taste is indistinguishable from the
type one, but it's a type two.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's novel in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: You smell something and go, damn,
that's a fire-ass energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for someone to go, oh,
it's only 14% THC and 8% CBD, that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: 14%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you consume it, and it's a really
enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still really get all of the relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like getting safely stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this wasn't good enough for her.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually my favorite world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we added more CBD, it essentially
became perfect for Samantha.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the trick with this, to tie into
breeding, is keeping the flavor constant
[SPEAKER_04]: across all these different cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more importantly, how do you develop a
parental set of lines that can breed true
[SPEAKER_04]: so that out of a thousand seeds,
they all have this chemical profile that
[SPEAKER_04]: is predictive of not only the terpene
concentration of flavor and aroma,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also predictive of the cannabinoid
ratio and concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a little bit more tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with any plant or human or dog or
whatever breeding, you must isolate one
[SPEAKER_04]: trait at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to conducting an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing in your grow room and
you change the humidity, the temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: and your nutrients, how do you know what
affected the plant and change your
[SPEAKER_04]: outcome?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same goes for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ryan Lee, actually, I'd like to bring
him up after my talk because he's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: the most knowledgeable as it pertains to
cannabis and cannabis breeding probably in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can describe all of the ins and
outs of whether it's a singular or
[SPEAKER_04]: singular nuclear trait and the informatics
behind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're good at is supplying the
infrastructure to create these novel
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the crux of it is, how do we go from
where we are today in this industry about,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, there's a lot of noise out there and
there's no talk of innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of music,
a lot of weed smoking, a lot of drinking,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not a lot of people talking about,
where are we going to go next year?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we going to protect our margins
moving forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's just, it's like a gravy chain
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, cheesecakes and pork chops
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to isolate a trait, to create parental
lines, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our pet projects are color traits,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's nice is if you take a really,
really great parental, it's purple,
[SPEAKER_04]: purple, and you hybridize it with an olive
green, and then you germinate that class.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get, like, this nice mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when you F to that class,
the purple trait bounces between every
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have 100 plants lined up in a
row and you're walking down, you can see
[SPEAKER_04]: the purple trait on the top side of the
leaf only, on the bottom side of the leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: only, on the pistils only.
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn pink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the flowers are purple and the leaves
are green, and the leaves are purple and
[SPEAKER_04]: the flowers are green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really neat the way the trait
bounces all around, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you want that trait to come back,
you have to pick the plants where you want
[SPEAKER_04]: the trait to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have to sell them and lock that
trait in one piece at a time, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people use males and females to
breed, and it's difficult to get
[SPEAKER_04]: segregation that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, you can talk to us later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's almost counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure any plant breeding projects
in the world that still go about it that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they use ethylene blockers to
create segregation so you have clear
[SPEAKER_04]: populations so you can isolate those
traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the future, obviously, we'll do
haploid lines and things like that and
[SPEAKER_04]: create reducers, which then you can pass
all those traits over really nice and
[SPEAKER_04]: smoothly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to show you some of the
innovations that have happened in the past
[SPEAKER_04]: few years so you can kind of see what the
trajectory of technology in the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: space looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: As shown, these are three OGs with
different cannabinoid concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same, you know, there's virtually
indistinguishing between each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be able to conduct patient panels or
research with these is very, very awesome
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's almost like having that
cannabinoid-less control that GW recently
[SPEAKER_04]: patented.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another series of plants from this
article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article was written with Dr. Ethan
Russo and Kevin Smith.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Pharmacological Foundations of
Cannabis Chemogars and it's published this
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are three lines with same terpene
profile, same flavor, same aroma,
[SPEAKER_04]: same bud structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one on your far left is one-to-one
THCV and THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one in the middle is approximately
one-to-one THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one on the right is one-to-one
CBD, CBDVA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where we're introducing the
propols in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have constant chemical, the flavor and
aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people try these different things,
they get pronounced different experiences
[SPEAKER_04]: that's highly driven by the cannabinoid
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where you start looking at
these different market segments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got the people who want to get
really scone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the OG people.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the soccer moms?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they like?
[SPEAKER_04]: The CBD, CBDV line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guava Jam is essentially this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a one that woke up CBD contest last
year and it gives you an experience
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere between nicotine and caffeine
without the jitters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely different than THC but
it's a pronounced effect, pronounced mood
[SPEAKER_04]: enhancement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these subtle effects and enhancements
are exactly what the masses are looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the type of technology to make
it tasty and flavorful and to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: products that people can try and will open
their minds on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other innovations here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is showing how you breed THC out of a
line using propol CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left is a one-to-one CBDV to CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you move across, you see the gold and
the doughnut getting larger and larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that CBDV, we're breeding
out the THC and replacing it with CBDV.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant on the far right has less than
0.1% THCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's obviously hemp but it's still
producing 10 to 12% cannabinoids and a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of them are turped out depending on which
plants you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, those plants would have this THC
moniker and that universal symbol which
[SPEAKER_04]: makes people think that there's THC in it
but like less than 0.1% is not much THC at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Piney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a series also in the
pharmacological foundations, Pinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left is mostly THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the right is mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle is a one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants are turped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plants in this family and one of
the parentals produces 4.5% pining alone,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pining's pretty harsh though.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start producing flowers for
consumption, I can smell harshness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a joke between everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh man, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people can smell CBD?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's odorless, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember walking in my friend's basement
and I'm like, man, it smells like radon in
[SPEAKER_04]: here, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Midwest joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, radon's odorless but funny to mess
with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This piney cultivar though, it's very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put enough myrcine or cariophiline
or limonine in it, it smooths out the
[SPEAKER_04]: pining a lot so it's more palatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But endurance runners, there's a group of
about 10 ultra runners where I'm from that
[SPEAKER_04]: just love pining one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives them enough of a pain reduction
that they can do their 50 or 100 mile run,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also they claim that the pining makes
them aware of the trail and not excited to
[SPEAKER_04]: jump off the cliff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know already, cannabis is
considered a performance-enhancing drug
[SPEAKER_04]: for ultra runners and long-distance
athletes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's banned because of that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it helps you turn your mind off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mind controls everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a factor here too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some really tasty CBG lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the left you have about 7% CBG and 20%
THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: These all smell like delicious pineapple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the one on the left is
actually a cultivar called happy pineapple
[SPEAKER_04]: that molecular farms produces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you see the light gray in the
doughnut getting larger and larger,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see again breeding out the THC and
replacing it with CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And keeping the flavor, which is osamine,
pining, and beta-carotene, pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they all smell have this nice sweet
osamine, pining flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have very different cannabinoid
concentrations, which results in very
[SPEAKER_04]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you that the CBG also does
what CBG kind of does, where it mitigates
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the adverse events of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It cools it down a little bit so you don't
get that panic attack or worrying about
[SPEAKER_04]: something, said your mom 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then CBG and CBD, which we've done
pretty much the same thing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here, I'm getting ushered
out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got tons and tons of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the whole premise of this conversation
was to educate and get you caught up on
[SPEAKER_04]: innovations happening chemically in the
cannabis plant world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then open the floor to questions and
bring my good friend Ryan Lee up here to
[SPEAKER_04]: help me answer him, since he's way smarter
than me at that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You leverage people who are smarter than
you to get the job done, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I'd just like to remind everyone
that in the past we had new regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future, it's going to be heavily
regulated, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're somewhere in the middle in what
Netro, we're a technology company,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to bridge the gap between the
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's important because
technology is not just about science and
[SPEAKER_04]: data and numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about people and stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our whole goal has always been to find
a problem and then create the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those solutions have to help people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just can't do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh gosh, I got an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's turn into a product and sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, that's not how successful
products are created.
[SPEAKER_04]: Successful products are created.
[SPEAKER_04]: I created by saying, look at all the
people that don't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we create something that they'll
actually like?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we create something that tastes
better?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we create something that's mold and
mildew resistant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And all those great things, which this
plant is so plastic and dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like corn and humans and dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just push it one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before you know it, you have a
Chihuahua plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a St. Bernard plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crazy different, but they all came
from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then creating those genetics to be
stable in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's an asexually propagated clone,
I'm kind of going off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can vary a lot from whether it's
outdoor or greenhouse, indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The chemo type of that genotype will
change depending on the environment
[SPEAKER_04]: because of epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a lot of the seeds that we produce
that are homozygous chemically and
[SPEAKER_04]: morphologically, they actually can endure
different environments and have more
[SPEAKER_04]: stability across those environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the future is going to be homozygous
seed production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we're stuck in this asexual clonal
production world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd just love to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you enjoyed the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this plant can treat everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody agree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Parker, the ICRS, Dr. Izzo-Russo,
everybody says it applications for this
[SPEAKER_04]: plant everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might remind you that the largest
pharmaceutical cannabis company in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world is GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they still get all of their
cannabinoids from plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So innovations in the plant space will
directly impact pharma and vice versa,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have any questions or comments,
I'd love to answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you enjoyed the talk.
I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to walk around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mic only works up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question on the analytical
testing specifically around the volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at testing of those terpenes from
the perspective of the plant itself and
[SPEAKER_02]: the breeding perspective and then the
consumer product, you would think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there would be some change in makeup of
those volatile terpenes through the
[SPEAKER_02]: cure-drive process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any comments around
appropriate time to perform that testing
[SPEAKER_02]: from both plant breeding and then also the
finished product perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it a wet-type sample that should be
submitted for the breeding information and
[SPEAKER_02]: the finished product for the consumer
information or any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously, you wouldn't want to test
the wet product if you're not selling the
[SPEAKER_04]: wet product.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if it were a commodity and you
were pushing that wet product as a fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: frozen thing, then perhaps it makes more
sense to do the wet testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, to get a phytofax report,
it's pre-packaging, like literally moments
[SPEAKER_04]: before packaging so that they can
guarantee the shelf life of that 60 days
[SPEAKER_04]: to be true to the phytofax.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't do the proper packaging,
packaging with seals, then naturally the
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation occurs faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not stored properly, it occurs
faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, terpene profile changes during
the curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were looking to protect some makeup
of those terpenes as an IP that you would
[SPEAKER_02]: generate, could that be on the product
itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess plant IP and patents on the plant
shouldn't be actually tested on the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's cured and dried, or is there
any thoughts around that compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: finished product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there enough variability to see
changes?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not a plant attorney,
so your guess is good, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Beth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're next on the Price is Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm next on the Price is Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have bid on this chair right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: $10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it, $20.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody need $21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to ask you about your
patents, but we'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about the homozygous
nature of these seeds, and there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: artist, Natalie Jeremy-Janko, who did,
are you familiar with her?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I should never have said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natalie Jeremy-Janko.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is an artist who did an experiment
some years ago called Many Trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she took clones of trees and planted
them in a variety of different locations
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically show how it impacts how
things grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain a little bit of the
science behind how stable seed lines can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produce more stability in
different environments?
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, I think that's a question for you,
isn't it?
What question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just to the killing of Conway,
answer any question you want, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: again, say, did I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were asking almost like I was
asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are seeds more robust chemically than
lungs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, how is it that,
because of the variability that can happen
[SPEAKER_00]: in different environments, how is it
possible to have stable seeds that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: more stability?
[SPEAKER_00]: More stable results in different
environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're breeding, we can only
control the genetics of the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And epigenetics, what we're referred to as
this environmental effect that happens
[SPEAKER_05]: across environments, is something that
you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what the genetics of the
plant are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So creating a homozygous seed really
allows us to have that uniformity so we
[SPEAKER_05]: can start exploring these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: An asexual propagation in itself is
stressful on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our studies show that the more stress
you put on that plant, the more it has a
[SPEAKER_04]: tendency.
[SPEAKER_04]: People say, oh, it lost its vigor,
or it's a genetic drift, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times, those asexually
propagating clones have become stressed
[SPEAKER_04]: out, whether they're mothers and they're
root bound.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not the best way to do that
for that plant, because you want all those
[SPEAKER_04]: switches turned on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if your plant is stressed out because
it's been asexually propagated and beaten
[SPEAKER_04]: up and locked down, whatever, it has a
tendency to be more myrcid dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabinoid and the oil concentration
goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way that we've seen to fix
that is to plant those plants in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground during a lengthening season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the spring, under the sun,
you get your circadian rhythm back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your unlimited root growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can snap a lot of the switches
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other ways are to strip it down to the
tissue culture and get that nice vigorous
[SPEAKER_04]: growth back to the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as for the seeds versus clones thing,
it's so notable, the difference between
[SPEAKER_04]: how a seed performs and a clone performs
from the vigorous side, from the
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance to pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite notable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing through the tissue
cultures of these countries in Canada now,
[SPEAKER_05]: the testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We realize that these plants they acquire,
it's like close to my distress disorder.
[SPEAKER_05]: These plants acquire, like Mark's calling
them stress events, but it's often
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria or viruses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they grow and they live with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the tissue cultures they can
do, is bring it back down to the Maristan
[SPEAKER_05]: and eliminate all those external forces of
the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you grow it back, you have a fresh
plant, which is really close to what we
[SPEAKER_05]: have in seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the benefits that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trade-off is with the current
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these seeds are hybrid seeds,
and they're kind of all over the place,
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotypically and chemotypically.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have that uniformity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the selling point, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy 10 seeds and get 10 phenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was someone who was saying
naturally to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really important thing to have,
this phenotype thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically, in regular agriculture,
that's something that's relegated to the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an everyday gardener thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go and they look for plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, in horticulture, producers
produce, and that's all they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't go and look for the variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that our community is
all about, which is great because we have
[SPEAKER_05]: this distributed platform where a lot of
different people are looking for a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different flavors and effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have one person's perspective on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a proper introduction to Ryan Lee,
he was founded by Maristan's many years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: He works directly with Horticulture and BV
through his company, King of Art.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does a lot of the importation into
Canada for seeds and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do, again, through our partnership with
Porter Farm in Canada, this really
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated system where you can't just
bring genetics into the system of licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to document where all their
seeds come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we facilitate genetics into these
companies.
Any other questions?
I have a question.
What do y'all feel about feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to go straight feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the proper term for feminized seeds is
actually gynoecious seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we talk about gynoecious monaceous,
you've probably heard these words.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes from the Greek word for two
houses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we have a gynoecious plant,
there's a male house and a female house of
[SPEAKER_05]: the same species.
[SPEAKER_05]: So gynoecious just means that the breeding
is done through two female plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use a chemical manipulation to
induce pollen on those plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can use that pollen for making the
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And originally, the seeds that came on the
market from Dutch Passion and some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these other early companies, the methods
that they used to generate that seed had
[SPEAKER_05]: all these inherent problems with
intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people were growing plants and having
female plants would be formed with seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, if it was cultivated for
flowers, it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that really tainted the
reputation of what we call feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people really wanted to stay with
these regular male-female crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is actually using males is a
pretty terrible way to select pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: donors for cannabis because the plants
themselves don't express the traits of
[SPEAKER_05]: interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use this kind of grass analogies.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're breeding humans for breast size,
it's pretty easy to choose the females.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you choose the males?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you choose the males that have that
trait for large breasts when they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: express that trait?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're doing female crosses and
similar to what we did in April,
[SPEAKER_05]: we really see that there's this huge gain
that you can get when you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: positive selection for chemistry on both
parentals.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just speeds up your breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also a beautiful thing when
you're screening those plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to go through and eliminate
the males around spending resources and
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now a lot of these companies are
offering these genetic sex tasks where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're paying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you pay $10 for the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you pay $15 to go and have the plant
sexed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just not really an efficient
use of resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of benefits of using the
cannabis process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, that's a trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're feminizing seeds and you grow
100, you have one male.
[SPEAKER_04]: You rove that male.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pick two more females.
[SPEAKER_04]: You feminize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have 1,000 and maybe one male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you pick the best one and feminize
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have 100,000 and only one
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can breed that trait out just the
same as any trait, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you recommend doing that to get to
the guy who's always just?
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, what's used is, as Mark said
earlier, ethylene inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ethylene is the major plant hormone that
controls gender in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same hormone that causes a banana
to ripen or avocados.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put it in a paper bag and you track
those gases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do in cannabis is we use these
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is a silver compound called
silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: You spray it on the plant and that blocks
the ethylene receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Jones is all about colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are the Smurfs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I don't know if you've seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some individuals on the internet
who wouldn't drink a bunch of colloidal
[SPEAKER_05]: silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: People think that it has this health
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it does in low amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you drink too much, you turn blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Smurfs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to Google and tap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to a nerdy school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some schools when people pass out from
drinking, they get on Mars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they use to spray some nitrate on
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they turn their skin brown and they
wake up and have a black face.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you believe you cannot know the gender
from the seed shape how they talk about
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bit of a fallacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seed shape like anything is just another
morphological characteristic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now at this point in time,
you can germinate the seeds and take a DNA
[SPEAKER_05]: sample and find the test that your DNA
means.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're Monsanto, you could use your
seed chipper.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big round of applause for Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
