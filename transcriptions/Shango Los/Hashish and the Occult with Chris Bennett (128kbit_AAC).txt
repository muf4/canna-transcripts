[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, thanks so much for taking a
little bit time with me I know you're busy
[SPEAKER_00]: talking a lot of people because you just
spoke last night on on hash and the occult
[SPEAKER_00]: and Magic and the nexus between them all
and I gotta tell you Ever since I saw you
[SPEAKER_00]: do your bit on hash church several months
ago I'm all like I would really like to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet this guy because while I haven't
researched a lot into the occult I've read
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about the OTO and Alistair Crowley
and and and some of the occult uses of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and That that when you were taught I
was picking up what you're putting down
[SPEAKER_00]: right nice and so I figure I'm probably
not the only one who has read some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Crowley books and Would be interested in
knowing like this little facet of this
[SPEAKER_00]: huge research body that you have so I hope
that you'd like like kind of break it all
[SPEAKER_00]: down for us the kind of the cross section
of hashish and the occult just just give
[SPEAKER_01]: us a little you know probably one of the
foremost books in the western like origins
[SPEAKER_01]: of the western occult tradition is this
13th century document the picatrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a translation of a 10th
century Islamic document the guy had
[SPEAKER_01]: al-keem and it has a recipe for Invoking
the servant of the moon with over a pound
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis resin a pound of resin a pound
of flour Yeah, a pound of resin yeah mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with stags blood and some other herbs And
then you see the spirit and the smoke over
[SPEAKER_01]: it so it goes that far back and right to
the Origins of the western magical
[SPEAKER_01]: tradition in the 16th century we have
grimoires like the Sefer Raziel and the
[SPEAKER_01]: book of Oberon That have recipes for a
cannabis ointment to be used for mirror
[SPEAKER_01]: sprying Right and you know it's evidence
that John Dee was using the same practice
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was nothing new you know and even
before Crowley in the 19th century figures
[SPEAKER_01]: like Helena Blavatsky who you probably
heard of She wrote about her use of
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish and said it she experienced
previous lifetimes on it and figures I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned in my talk yesterday like Pascal
Beverly Randolph or Rosa Prussian and sex
[SPEAKER_01]: magician very influential on Crowley's OTO
and in the OTO itself it's interesting The
[SPEAKER_01]: founder of the OTO or Theodore Ruse he was
actually a opera singer at one time in
[SPEAKER_01]: this opera by Wagner Richard Wagner called
Parsifal and The foremost Wagner an
[SPEAKER_01]: autobiographer who knew Wagner He says
that Wagner was inspired to make the opera
[SPEAKER_01]: itself after being turned on to Indian
hemp extract by Arthur Schopenhauer the
[SPEAKER_01]: famous philosopher right so it's already
kind of an element of you can feel it
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbling bubbling you know and so Crowley
was later Initiated into the OTO and
[SPEAKER_01]: became the Grand Master and they said that
something he had published Revealed one of
[SPEAKER_01]: their great secrets you know and it's
interesting because around that same time
[SPEAKER_01]: he published on the psychology of hashish
kind of a scientific essay on how Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: was affecting the mind and I think that
you know Crowley said it really well He
[SPEAKER_01]: says you know what hashish is doing is
bringing up the subconscious into the
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious and I think that's really the
pivotal aspect of Cannabis' role in magic
[SPEAKER_00]: and alchemy and stuff like that and to go
deeper on that same point then so are you
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that they're like okay we have
the hash and it isn't really about let's
[SPEAKER_00]: party because we're wealthy and we you
know we're in the party class but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like no no no no but because we were
occultists meaning we want to dive deep
[SPEAKER_00]: into the human psyche and we're using
hashish as a tool absolutely you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: was never like Crowley made it quite clear
he didn't think that cannabis alone would
[SPEAKER_01]: bring somebody to these higher levels of
consciousness that it took a good focused
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of work and you know magic was a
technique of also doing that in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with Cannabis so and you ought
to remember too in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: instances wasn't these weren't people that
were using cannabis all the time this was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was used specifically for
mirror scrying these are ceremonies yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah ritual magic so they weren't
like really used to the cannabis high like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people are today and in some
cases you know I was talking you about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoroastrian examples of these guys like
Ardu Veeraf and Vishtaspa they were
[SPEAKER_01]: ingesting very potent extracts which is
not like casually smoking a joint with
[SPEAKER_01]: some friends you know what I mean these
type of potions they can knock you right
[SPEAKER_00]: out you know and you can have a full-on
visionary experience well right I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people don't realize that you know
we smoke hash and we smoke flour but back
[SPEAKER_00]: in these days people would take balls of
hash and you know the hash eaters right
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah they would eat hash and at that level
it's kind of psychedelic absolutely you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I talked about Lewis Alfahan's
Kahagne yesterday another figure from the
[SPEAKER_01]: 19th century and his book sanctuary of
spiritualism was stories of people
[SPEAKER_01]: ingesting three grams of hash each strong
coffee and then they would record their
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences and these experiences are very
otherworldly I had never heard it is it
[SPEAKER_00]: called mirror scrying mirror scrying yeah
so I had never heard of that until your
[SPEAKER_00]: talk last night and so am I correct it
would be like you you you would get really
[SPEAKER_00]: high and in touch with your you know bring
up the unconscious using the hash and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you essentially stare into it until your
mind fills that yeah yeah that's right
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's exactly right same with
crystal gazing you know holy crystal ball
[SPEAKER_01]: actually same technique and John Dee who I
mentioned yesterday used both the
[SPEAKER_01]: blackened mirrors for mirrors growing and
crystal balls so they're kind of one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same really but you could even use
like in some of the age literature people
[SPEAKER_01]: just stare into a cup you know and any
sort of reflective surface you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean something that can give suggestions
back to your mind to play with yeah so I
[SPEAKER_00]: was curious so so were they what we would
call dealing were these were they like
[SPEAKER_00]: importing the hash and then also selling
or were they were that like below them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were the higher class so they
were just buying it and then you like for
[SPEAKER_01]: their magic totally I'm Crowley you know
for a big part of the time he was using it
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't illegal so he was using extracts
he was getting through a pharmacist and
[SPEAKER_01]: there were pharmacists that he was
involved with that were also it's funny
[SPEAKER_01]: it's funny to think the golden dawn as
well as well as his mescaline extracts he
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting them from Park Davis and you
know visited Park Davis and you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: went to the company and you know purchased
it right there and checked out their
[SPEAKER_01]: factory and that type of stuff and in the
OTO you know in Martin stars the unknown
[SPEAKER_01]: God which is like a history of the first
California Lodge of the OTO guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the in the OTO are growing cannabis
indica and this is after prohibition so
[SPEAKER_01]: they were still continuing to use cannabis
you know after it had been illegal and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it and supply it themselves right
well they knew they had a good thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: that's for sure so you know cocaine
certainly comes up in the Crowley books
[SPEAKER_00]: and in retrospect his reputation is just
peppered with you know you know cocaine
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rumors of him eating babies you
know people the kind of trash people talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about Satanist really that's not really
what it's about was he pretty much just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a freelance do all the drugs
kind of guy or did he have a special place
[SPEAKER_01]: for hash well you know he had a special
place for cannabis you know he
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledged in his writings that he'd
struggle with both addiction under cocaine
[SPEAKER_01]: and heroin particularly which he suffered
with tell his death you know you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that a lot of heroin use was
medical and Crowley's use of heroin was
[SPEAKER_01]: often medical is prescribed by doctors
they would prescribe for asthma and other
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments and stuff like that so he became
addicted through pharmaceutical use it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not like he was like on the street heroin
right or something like that is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical drugs and had become a
little too accustomed to sad story it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: common modern story to modern story as
well right and he really struggled with it
[SPEAKER_01]: he wrote about that struggle he thought
that cannabis and mescaline were
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly the drugs for loosening the
girders of the soul this is a term he
[SPEAKER_01]: borrowed from the Chaldean oracles of
zoroaster particularly the translation
[SPEAKER_01]: done by dr. Wynn Westcott the founder of
the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn who
[SPEAKER_01]: also wrote about the use of cannabis for
magical purposes so you know he considered
[SPEAKER_01]: them more magical substances than cocaine
or heroin for sure he wasn't down on
[SPEAKER_01]: cocaine but he made a really good comment
one time about like how you kind of kill a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant when you extract the active chemical
out of it he thought there was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the coca that somebody
would chew in Peru and you know run
[SPEAKER_01]: through the mountains then cocaine which
is super processed yeah which is super
[SPEAKER_01]: processed and also between you know raw
opium and heroin and he thought that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know in its natural form with all its
natural alkaloids and stuff like that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant was still kind of like a living
entity but extracted like that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: killed the plant it's kind of like
old-school whole plant medicine yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so so you we know that Crowley Crowley
wrote about hash and then you've mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple other folks have who have written
about hash are those books you know do
[SPEAKER_00]: they age well are they are they still
relevant and interesting to read nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: or do we know so much more that they're
they're kind of outdated well cruelly
[SPEAKER_01]: psychology hashish I think is worth a read
especially if you're into like yoga
[SPEAKER_01]: meditation because it uses a lot of the
states of consciousness in yoga as an
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy for the hashish intoxication and
different levels of intoxication so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's pretty pretty readable and
there's definitely I would say a growing
[SPEAKER_01]: scene around Crowley and OTO magic right
now there seems to be a real Renaissance
[SPEAKER_01]: of that type of stuff maybe due to the
popularity of the strange angel TV series
[SPEAKER_01]: you know strange angel based on rocket
scientists Jack Parson who has a crater
[SPEAKER_01]: named on him on the moon named after him
on the moon he was also a cannabis user
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote about it you know and referred to it
in one of his poems you know and did
[SPEAKER_01]: mescaline in the desert for magic rituals
with L Ron Hubbard before his break off
[SPEAKER_01]: into Scientology so yeah pretty
interesting history for sure right on cool
[SPEAKER_00]: before I let you go I wanted you to give a
plug to it you have a new book out right
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's right Lieber 420 cannabis
magical herbs in the occult you can find
[SPEAKER_01]: it on Amazon or if you google Lieber 420
you can find some interviews about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing and if you look in the
first comment there's gonna be linked
[SPEAKER_00]: there so that makes it super easy so Chris
Bennett thank you so much for your time
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice to hang out with you right on
All right.
All right.
