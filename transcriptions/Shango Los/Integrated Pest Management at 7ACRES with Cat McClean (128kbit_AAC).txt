[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good morning to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go So Katherine, thank you so much
for sharing some of your time with me You
[SPEAKER_02]: know the reason why I'm so excited to talk
to you was that yesterday on the tour here
[SPEAKER_02]: at seven acres You know you were the one
of the first people that I met and and you
[SPEAKER_02]: were surrounded by beneficial insects and
and I'm like my people right and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: as you you know gave me your part of the
tour I realized That you were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: something that a lot of other folks in
cannabis Say they do but in practice they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't and that's integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for many folks You'll ask somebody,
you know what their strategies are for IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll say we spray which is just
like one thing or you say What's your
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated pest management?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh we use beneficial bugs
and that's just one thing But when I came
[SPEAKER_02]: here you're responsible for millions and
millions of dollars of plants and and you
[SPEAKER_02]: showed me a whole array of strategies that
you use to keep the pest pressure down and
[SPEAKER_02]: You integrate them and and I'm like,
oh my gosh, this is legit integrated pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management and so I'm really glad that you
had a little time this morning so that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you could lay out the strategy to
give folks an idea of what it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: scaled and Done with a proper budget,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So so would you please start with you
know, kind of just walk us through your
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy for keeping pest pressure Low
here at seven acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will talk about my job all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great So we do a very integrated approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work with production Sanitation our
own department and our focus is more on
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention and not reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've found over the years that the
best way to keep our press pressure down
[SPEAKER_01]: is To not have them in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we track We have our scouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They track everything So if there's a
plant alive in our facility, one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: trained IPM staff is looking at that plant
once a week It's very intensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we we track Everything that could be
weird looking or oh, what is this and we
[SPEAKER_01]: do it so often So we can react quickly to
any issues that may arise and I can you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Call one of our suppliers and say I
need X and I have it next week and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see anything the week after we also
work with sanitation, so they're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal job in this facility and that
is actually the key to a successful IPM
[SPEAKER_01]: program is the cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not seeing any recurrence or very
minimal reoccurrence of pests in rooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: we work together very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you just switched your
spray to on turnover, but it is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please keep that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do formal monitoring with sticky
cards in all our rooms and our beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects is actually our soldiers on the
ground that are really helping us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very intensive program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We receive our bugs on one day and the
next day they are throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any given week for insects we're
applying 350 to 400,000 in a flower room
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will hunt out all the little bad
guys and keep them at a very very low
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, which is amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start at the beginning and I'll
poke a little bit at each of those,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, you mentioned your
scouting staff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to see, it was amazing to
find out that all of these analytics in
[SPEAKER_02]: your scouting team, everybody's all
connected by computers and spreadsheets
[SPEAKER_02]: and when folks are scouting and they find
something wrong with a plant, that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is marked and it's put on a spreadsheet
and on a map of the room so you know
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly where it is so then you can
monitor the plants around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fully involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want, my question is though,
is you had all this big color code of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the different things that the scouts are
looking for and some of those things I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't even know what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you give us an idea of the variety
of things that the scouts are scouting
[SPEAKER_02]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So primarily they're looking for pest
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite easy to see, fun fact about
humans is we can see more shades of green
[SPEAKER_01]: than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're confronted in a room with
that many plants, it seems like a daunting
[SPEAKER_01]: task but once you do it a few times,
you actually, oh, that doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll look and see, okay,
no, it's nothing or it could be pest
[SPEAKER_01]: damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for bud rot like mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at root structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we see a plant and the leaves might
be a little off color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pulling down the root bags and
taking a look and saying, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what, is there damage on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at the whole stock,
all the leaves, everything, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a lot but they look for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are they looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much anything that doesn't belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've been in the rooms a few
times, you get to, even though every
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is different, you get to know
generally what cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see something, that doesn't
belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we jump in and figure out what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look for physical damage,
harm to the buds, pests, any form material
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't belong in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spreadsheet that you showed me where
you were marking off the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, they had that long list on the
right-hand side with color coding.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different categories do you think
there were for things that the scouts had
[SPEAKER_02]: to check off?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to guess, I'm guessing there's
maybe like 14 or 15 categories of the
[SPEAKER_02]: types of damage they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anything that could damage the
product, the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also want to recognize,
okay, is this an isolated incident or is
[SPEAKER_01]: this spreading?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we find reoccurring instances,
we have a number code as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can look at that map and say,
okay, well, we found this on this side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the room and the same thing the next week
on this side of the room that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by staff movement in and out of the
rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we pinpoint something and then we
start seeing it all around, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, this is something that is spreading
from this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go in and make the decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to affect our crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we cut the loss and get rid of the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there a way that we can treat this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I just do a hotspot treatment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bombard this area with persimilis
or swirski or lace wings, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even before the scouts are going in and
going down this very specific list of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they might tick off,
I'm assuming that just because everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: was in such heavy gear, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That that is probably step one is just to
make sure that the people are not bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: in stuff from the outside, then they're
not moving it from room to room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you give us a brief understanding
of how the gear we wear and the magic
[SPEAKER_02]: things we're all stepping on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a little context for what that
stuff's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so everything is controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a research facility type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wear your street clothes in,
but then you are issued a clean uniform
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an outside company that wanders
them and brings them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you change into that in our change
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have dedicated shoes for zone two
where all the grow rooms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going into the rooms, if we have a
very set order that you can go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our nursery and our vegetative rooms
where all the production crops are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from is a very set order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go from one to another to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have to go backwards,
you're going out, you're taking a shower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting a new uniform into every
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hair net is worn at all times in zone
two, even in the hallways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have we use isopropyl alcohol 70
percent to clean our gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like in every room,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as you showed me around every room,
it's like present your hands, present your
[SPEAKER_02]: hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first, I mean, after at the second
room, like, oh, no, I did that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: other room like and they're like,
no, let's let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going in and out, we have boot baths
for your shoes, even though they're
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated to zone two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's where there's all kinds of
operations and debris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's they just changed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's a stir back that's in there
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just is just to wipe the bottom of
your shoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is a room that may have a
potential problem in it, it's restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more so, our tolerance is actually
kind of akin to ornamental crop
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses in that if we can isolate an
issue to a room, it's a very low
[SPEAKER_01]: occurrence and we will find it in another
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the staff going in there have even more
procedures to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're exiting that room,
they're taking off their hair net and
[SPEAKER_01]: their gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exit the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We encourage them to not interact with
other staff members in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have to go into another room,
shower and change your uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that's what I was
thinking, too, is I really enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that you don't use Tyvek suits
because like, you know, I tour in Tyvek
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time and that stuff gets used once
and it's gone and ends up in a landfill
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the solution here where I
didn't see any Tyvek, but everyone was
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing seven, eight, eight acres,
like, I guess they'd consider like golf
[SPEAKER_02]: shirts, long sleeve golf shirts and what
are essentially like sweatpants or like
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like scrub pants with the pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and you just send those off and it
had to be washed and come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that because, you know,
there's already enough environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: degradation from our industry from the
light usage and dupe tubes and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being able to at least get rid
of Tyvek, at least we're going in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right direction, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about my favorite part,
the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to the bugs, you know,
I look at deploying beneficial insects and
[SPEAKER_02]: predatory mites in two different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first flavor is preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a problem today,
but we don't want to have a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got what you were calling
hotspot treatment where, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to bombard this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your general bugs for
prevention that you go for and because you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to play defense for particular types
of pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: We generally use beneficial insects that
are polyphagic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they eat a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do green lacewing larva for
primarily aphids, but I mean, they eat
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's something and it comes
across them, they're going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have two sachets that are breeding
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll both extend the life of the mites
that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use swirski and californicus for
whitefly and spider mites respectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sachets are cool and they have on the
carrier there's a fungus and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually two kinds of mites in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have feeder mites that the swirski
eat and little holes and they crawl out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'll breed and have eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually later on today I'll be ripping
open some of ours and seeing if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get about three weeks out of them in
the flower rooms, which is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good to point out though,
when you get the sachets, rookies
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes will receive the sachets and
they're ripping them open.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, if you just look for movement,
you might be seeing a feeder mite you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need actually a microscope of some
sort or even a really good hand loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need about 60 to 80 times
magnification to see the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: because they are very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in size, but once you see the
difference between them, it's very obvious
[SPEAKER_01]: that that is not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do soil applications to deal with
larval stages of fungus mass primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do nematodes and schematists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't pronounce the first ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radiolalaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is your primary defense team,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting those in on a regular
schedule constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And heavily because, what do they say,
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
[SPEAKER_02]: cure or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes, and you may not have run
into it in this facility yet, but
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes things fall apart, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got a hot spot and you've got
an invader.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk us through how your system would
show up in your system and then how you
[SPEAKER_02]: would respond to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would find the damage first.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your scouts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the scouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes even the groom staff,
they spend a lot of time in the crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a highlight, actually, of everybody's
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come down to our station and they go,
we found something weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our reaction is pest dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our reaction to say, aphids is going to
be vastly different from thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on the life cycle of the
pest, how quickly it can multiply,
[SPEAKER_01]: what stage of development the plant is
currently at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cooling down and that's going to
slow their life cycle down, I might just
[SPEAKER_01]: go do a beneficial application as a hot
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will reallocate some from another
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run a little extra everywhere,
so we have that leeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I will call a supplier and say,
hey, I need a parasitic wasp next week
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it will be a cull of the
plant if the pressure on the plant is bad
[SPEAKER_01]: enough or if it's a certain type of pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the very quick breeding
pests like whiteflies or aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: their life cycle, if you look at it,
it's the definition of exponential growth
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is very hard to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is better just to put a plastic bag
over that plant and cut it down and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes an insecticidal soap we will
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try not to spray as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe almost never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last time we did a spray was
like four months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a cull on a case by case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's something like a thrip or a
spider mite and it's one plant in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to heavily defoliate that
plant and then I'm going to put as many
[SPEAKER_01]: predators as I can on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all around it and then we will watch
it over the next two weeks and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that it hasn't recurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's multiple cases in a room,
I'm going to status that room and people
[SPEAKER_01]: going in and out are very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way it won't spread to the rest
of the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you had wasps in one of the rooms
when I was on tour yesterday because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only ever seen them in books in
theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got lots of different types of wasps
on Vashon Island where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that not all of them are
stinging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all wasps are threats, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most are our friends and pollinator
allies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I was going through
beneficial insects and learning for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time five or six years ago and I saw
that there were wasps, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: who the hell is going to let wasps go in
there and grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you read about them,
you're like, wow, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you run into, when you're getting the
staff used to coexisting with wasps in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room, did you have to convince anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an explanation, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you hear wasp and what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that we use are parasitic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we need to, those actually wasps are
great for reaction and less so for
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for them to survive and be viable
as a beneficial insect in your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, it's better just not to use
it and use a mite instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have to bring them in,
you let everybody know these are specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have stingers as you know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not a bumblebee or a wasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're attacking the, if it's like an
aphid, they're going to attack that aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they're doing is they're
injecting their eggs in there and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: hatches and they're not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to fly at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do get stuck on our sticky cards,
but it's one of those, they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an issue, just try to get one
in there because they're top notch as a
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know at Seven Acres, you have a blend
of cultivators, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks have cultivated cannabis in the
past and they're straight up heritage
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, but also there's some people that
you bring in and you train them up over
[SPEAKER_02]: the course of a couple years to be really
good cultivator folk on the team,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there, and I know I didn't warn you
about this ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any particular incorrect
expectation that you get from the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have already got growing experience
about doing integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're finding is pretty common and
you often need to train out of folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spraying is your preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the go-to and it's been a go-to
for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a different approach in that we
will have some and we will use it if we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to, but we want the cleanest product
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for spraying, it's very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It disrupts all our operations,
especially at this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The team, some of them are okay,
but I would much rather not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one is a big one and it's a lot
of, so integrated pest management,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in cannabis is very,
it's a new concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of trying to explain,
oh yeah, you are finding these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a cricket or something in a
hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to know about that because
then the next couple of days I'm crawling
[SPEAKER_01]: around on the floor looking for the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other big ones is you're
not ever going to be pest free,
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is wholly unrealistic, but you take
measures to keep it at such a level that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's manageable for you and it's not going
to cause any kind of economic loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more vigilant you are tracking
that type of, those types of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, part of my pummel, nip it in the
butt before it gets to a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to be able to get rid
of all of them, but keep them lonely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep them very lonely and they don't
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chances are, you know, our lace wing might
come up and just eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Catherine, thank you so much for
your time and your joy about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed your part of the tour
yesterday and I knew that as soon as I met
[SPEAKER_02]: you, I'm like, oh, I want to talk to her
some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
