[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite kind of people are
open-hearted, active learners.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people who generally are kind to
others, try to not be a jerk, and are
[SPEAKER_01]: really engaged with the world and learning
new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the reasons I fell in love
with the autoflower breeding community a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This oft-maligned and ridiculed subgenre
of cannabis cultivation are some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite underdogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days, they were laughed and
trolled right off the popular message
[SPEAKER_01]: boards until they eventually formed their
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout the years of being hassled,
they just kept sharing genetics and best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices with each other, slowly doing
the difficult grunt work on autoflower
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that will make all the future
autoflower breeders look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern autoflowers are pretty much just
starting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some winners in the past,
but now that Ruderalis has been tamed,
[SPEAKER_01]: now is the time when talented growers will
really start building up the library of
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflower terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have been listening to my show for
a while, you probably noticed that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: turned on to the power of autoflowers
about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was attracted to autoflowers because
they were a perfect solution for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend to cannabis patients who have
weather not as perfect for growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as California.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Pacific Northwest where I live,
through the northern climates of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest, and the short summer cold
northeast, we all want to grow under the
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine, but our summers don't stay hot
enough and our real summer weather rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts to the middle of October when we'd
normally harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an autoflower, you can start it
outdoors the last week in May and harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: it mid-September, fully ripe and packed
with terps and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular plants won't finish most places
until at least mid-October, if at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early October cold and rain makes for a
lot of disappointing growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: With autoflowers, you are harvested,
hung to dry, and often in jars well before
[SPEAKER_01]: the rain starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I discovered autoflowers for
myself, I dug in deeply to learn as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as I could and then programmed a whole
year of autoflower content in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few podcast episodes, put together
a half dozen live panels, and a pair of
[SPEAKER_01]: live events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was even invited to write a jacket
endorsement for the new Jeff Loewenfels
[SPEAKER_01]: book on autoflowers that came out that
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercialization hasn't really come to
autoflowers yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have a very mixed reputation
and home growing is still in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But patients have adopted them and they
are remaking patient home growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today's show is an attempt to get the
early days of autoflower history up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: present on record from the perspective of
a person who was present from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a complete history because no
one could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't cover modern commercial hemp
varieties like the work of Oregon CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the show today,
you will have a really well fleshed out
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of the last 12 years of
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years of THC autoflowers being grown by
home cultivators and the basics of what
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding autoflowers is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you used CBG dominant cannabis
flower, tincture or other preparations in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last six months?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo asked me to let you know
that he and others are conducting a study
[SPEAKER_01]: to determine the benefits and drawbacks to
kanabajiral and they would love your
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes
and can be anonymous if you wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study is available at bit.ly
[SPEAKER_01]: and the link is in the notes for this
episode on shapingfire.com too.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Dan Jimmy, more commonly
known in the underground as Full Duplex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan is founder and breeder at Mandalorian
Genetics, an award winning and
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally well respected line of
autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also co-founder of autoflower.net,
the center of the autoflower breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation universe since 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're gonna take you back to 2008 in
the autoflower world and walk us back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, welcome to the show, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad that you made the time
here during the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to have this chat with
you for a while and I'm glad we finally
[SPEAKER_01]: found the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get going by starting talking
about the legacy, the legacy autoflower
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that existed prior to 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, as we'll talk later,
2010 seemed to be a real changing time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but prior to 2010 it was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about those early cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, around 2009 and 2010 we started
to see the emergence of autoflowering
[SPEAKER_00]: strains hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember looking at seed banks like
Attitude Seed Bank back in the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing these things were called
autoflowers and that they were light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only bad thing about that was is they
weren't very potent and they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of terpene content and they just
weren't robust plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some smaller cultivars, quick and fast to
grow, I think they were definitely very
[SPEAKER_00]: early in their infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say not a lot of terpene
profile, do you mean that there just
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't a lot there at all or just that it
was unpleasant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a combination of both,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the smell that was emitted from
the flower wasn't like the gas that we
[SPEAKER_00]: look for today or the other terpene
profiles that, you know, produce bakery
[SPEAKER_00]: smells or sweets and things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just the smoke was a little
harsh because it was still, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: early root or alice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't had a lot of selection done to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did do was flower and unseemly
or a seemingly quick time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where did these root or alice genetics
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: From my memory and being around back then
watching them emerge and majority of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was coming from the European market,
Spain and other EU territories where they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been working with them, you know,
prior to 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowrider, I think everybody remembers
Lowrider 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Snowrider and Mossy's Purple
Gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a few other companies out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dynafem had the Roadrunner Auto
and very early on exploration of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense that the root or alice
genetics would show up in Europe first
[SPEAKER_01]: considering the plants originally came
from Siberia and Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are so close as far as
traffic routes go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how those seeds would easily be
discovered in Russia then make their way
[SPEAKER_01]: into Europe for people to start playing
with then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it odd to think about how these same
cultivars, these pre-2010 cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: to one group of people who are visionary
breeders, they're like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: this can change everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, over the next X amount of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're also the same cultivars
that gave autoflowers such a terrible
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even though all the flowers have
gotten so much better, there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have that knee-jerk response
that, oh, autoflowers suck, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad yield, bad smells and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was definitely true
pre-2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, these same cultivars inspired a
bunch of people and then turned off a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was truly a catch-22.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you said there was right
on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people saw a huge potential for
these and they may not have known at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time what that potential was, but they
decided to give the plant a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are the folks that,
you know, got that impression stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: their head and then they didn't want to
either mess with it anymore or give the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar an opportunity to change by
assisting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been assisting the
cannabis plant in whole for centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there was a group that
snatched a hold of that new potential and
[SPEAKER_00]: really became, like you said, a visionary
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people stuck in their ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the LED versus HID
lighting debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's new tech and old tech
and you see people using a hybrid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what a pain in the ass too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as far as breeding goes,
we'll talk more about the breeding in the
[SPEAKER_01]: third set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just quickly, you know, breeding
autoflowers is not as simple as breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: regular photo periods where you just like,
you know, male meet female, boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've chucked some pollen and now you've
got new seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with the autoflowers,
the ruteralis genetics were so janky with
[SPEAKER_01]: their low yields and smells to,
you know, to dress that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were crossing it into flowers that
had a better reputation and more
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes that people liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, you're taking something that is
janky and poor smell and hitting it
[SPEAKER_01]: against something that you potentially
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, gosh, that takes a lot more work to
breed out those attributes that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take some time, especially if
you're, you know, what I like to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: building a new cultivar from the ground up
with ruteralis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get your hands on true
ruteralis these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that want to start a project
to where they take their favorite photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period strain and they want to make it an
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does involve a few years worth of work
to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those early days, was there just
essentially one ruteralis cultivar that
[SPEAKER_01]: people were handing around to hit their
favorite plants with or were there several
[SPEAKER_01]: to choose from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier on, there were several to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the painstaking work had been
taken out of it with the arrival of
[SPEAKER_00]: lowrider and lowrider 2, the purple rider
or purple gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour 60 was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big one back in that early time
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that sub work had
been done to where the autoflowering or
[SPEAKER_00]: day neutral trait was dominant in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sure owe a lot of credit to those
cultivators, breeders early on who did all
[SPEAKER_01]: that like really annoying work to
stabilize the, you know, the autoflower
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive trait, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like it would not be nearly as
much fun if you had to do all that work
[SPEAKER_01]: just to make your own autoflower nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were definitely pioneers in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'll touch back on like Dutch
Passion and Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they saw the potential very
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put in a lot of work behind the
scenes and, you know, I come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've talked about this, we may talk
about it a little more as I came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Forum days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there wasn't a Instagram out
there or Cannibuzz or any of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms that we see today to where we
could just openly share about what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how were autoflower breeders finding
each other back pre 2010?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can, I started delving into autos in
2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when, you know, you just kind
of peruse these forums that were out there
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly at the time for me was ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would find other people grow in
these autoflowers and you would have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, key item search or key term
search to be able to locate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of how we were finding
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're through the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we found each other, you know,
you start developing the relationships and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were, we're going to be talking more
about autoflower network here in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but talk a little bit about how rough
it was to be an autoflower person on
[SPEAKER_01]: these, on these breeder sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we were the joke,
the butt of all the jokes, the never taken
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously anytime that you would go into
say, just a generalistic forum about
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding a set of nutrients or
understanding a soil type or a grow medium
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute that you mentioned that you
were growing an auto cultivar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, radio silence, or you got,
you know, or you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got laughed at, you got told you're
growing ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it was kind of, you know,
it was getting bullied for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of better term back in those
early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we kind of had to,
uh, you know, rely on each other and rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that was a drag and we're really
grateful, um, that we have so many more
[SPEAKER_01]: resources now and, and let's, so let's,
let's, let's talk about how that turning
[SPEAKER_01]: that corner happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for anybody who's been
following this, there's something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like magic happened there around 2010,
2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of things in the autoflower
scene happened at once and they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: going in the direction of stronger auto
flowers and a stronger auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so what do you think happened there in
2010, um, that really started to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, push the threshold and,
and turn the corner to, to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, you know, present blossoming of the
auto flower scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll take it back to community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, everybody that was joining up on these
forums, they initially started out in one
[SPEAKER_00]: place and then one thing leads to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either get banned or you move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, around 2010, we started finding
each other at a new forum, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed an influx and what we
decided to do was basically have one sole
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated thread to autoflowering
cannabis, because we were searching and
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting for a sub forum or a place that we
could go in as the community at large,
[SPEAKER_00]: who all had the same love for the specific
cultivar cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could share the stuff that to all
make us understand it and grow it better,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the main forums, it was getting
lost in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was, you know, a few posts
here, a few posts there, a section here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't one simple central
resource for all of us to get together and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade ideas with and have a virtual smoke
sesh, if you will, and share about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think around 20, I know around 2010,
there was a, um, a thread formed and roll
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I noticed a lot of people
starting to migrate to and see a need for,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, better information, more in depth and
play places to talk about experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than just, Oh my God, this plant
flowers without a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste very good, but we can
grow a lot of weed quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this, so, so right after this
period, when you started seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: people come together, um, on the roll it
up, is this when you and your co-founders
[SPEAKER_01]: decided now is the time to create your own
home with autoflower.net, the autoflower
[SPEAKER_01]: network?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had brought over the forum,
call or not the forum, but excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thread called the art of the auto and
roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a place where it was
centralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was speaking about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after working in there for a few
months, I got, um, approached by,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a breeder by the name of Mossy and a
gentleman from Canada, um, to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: create our own home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had begged admin and roll it up
multiple, multiple times just to give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: sub form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't looking for a dedicated forum,
um, our main page splash page on their
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanted a place where we can make
it easier for people to find each other
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having to combing comb through,
you know, Google search results or even a
[SPEAKER_00]: really poor search engine on a forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got approached and we started
spitting ideas and what we wanted it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gentleman from Canada got the
server space and knew a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew some backend work as far as server
maintenance and building, and Mossy had
[SPEAKER_00]: the information and experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was one of the earlier, what I like to
call independent breeders that weren't big
[SPEAKER_00]: name like Dutch passion and dine with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she had really put the work into
early root or Alice and really working it
[SPEAKER_00]: geared towards med and improving terpium
profiles to where, you know, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a good medication for better
circulation for nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she played a huge key role and
she's kind of a silent person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to talk about, you know,
talk about her as much as I possibly can,
[SPEAKER_00]: because she was a mentor a to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think she left a huge impact as she
had one of the first colored auto fly auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cannabis varieties out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is where was she living or still?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's still in Spain, Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how much Spain comes up
right around this time with the change in
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that, um, you know,
Spain was at the forefront of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the new, the new wave of auto flower
genetics into this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a huge gravitational pull
towards that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Spain's has, um, different laws than
what we do, and especially at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a, as a hub for a lot
of this auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what my experience has been in,
you know, kind of growing up in this
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, for lack of better term as seeing
like a lot of the stuff is European based,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of it's Spain based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's interesting too, because,
um, you know, people, there's one set of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who talk about the fantastic
heritage genetics that come from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then you've got other people
who talk about these trashy European
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that like, you know,
the both are probably true, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just, just like most truths have got
a little bit of this and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there's all of this,
this, uh, this new amazing work that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of Spain at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's also other people putting
out stuff that had not really hit the mark
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of some of those folks that were
bringing their seeds over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, there was good and good and
bad stuff coming out of Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like there's probably good and bad
stuff coming out of everywhere right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, you know, do you remember some
of those names coming out of Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who, who were the first reliable people
doing stuff in Spain around, around this
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010 time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the 2010 time, um, again,
Dutch Passion, Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hadn't seen some of our newer big
brands that come out of Spain quite yet at
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, because I think with, we'll give an
example of one of the cultivars was Think
[SPEAKER_00]: Different by Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the largest autoflower I had ever
seen within a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they were working on it well
before obviously the 2010 mark or coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into the 2011 mark, but it was called
Think Different and it was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, guys, went from getting a few ounces
per plant and to getting a pound per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in the proper conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, I think set off like this
emergency flare of like, there's some huge
[SPEAKER_00]: potential here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it helped shift some people who
are on the fence to really take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant and start working at it as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some people made some huge,
you know, changing decisions to grab a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the resurgence of Spanish autoflower
genetics, or maybe not resurgence,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the explosion of Spanish autoflower
genetics and with people around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, being able to see that happening
between the various forums, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of the threads, but then also the
beginning of autoflower network,
[SPEAKER_01]: did Spain start to, do you attract
attention for being a leader and start to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, attract brain power towards it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we'll kind of fade into the
beginning of autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a forum up, we have an
informational board.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people coming from all over the
world to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, harvested a lot of people
from the older threads, the older message
[SPEAKER_00]: boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it gave a gateway for people
to come in and start to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed, um, after we get
everything up and running, I have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a hiatus and I come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back, I see this,
this new brand that A, at first the
[SPEAKER_00]: hillbilly and me didn't know how to
pronounce, pronounce the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after seeing it enough, I had to do my
research and that was Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so I've, um, was, was Mitch in
Spain or was, was Mitch going to Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've never been clear about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always thought, I always thought
Mephisto was an American brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, then, but then people keep on
telling me like, oh, when Mitch went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain, like, did he come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's, what's the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from what I know, Mitch left to go to
Spain from where I am not a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent certain on that part of the
backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that he went to Spain to
really put in the work to build up the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephisto brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: For so many people that really seems to
have been like Mitch is part of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people background story, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I, when I talk to people,
early heads who are into auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them, you know, get to a point in
their story where, and then I got a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds from Mitch, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems that, um, uh, you know,
Mitch going to Spain with the connections
[SPEAKER_01]: that he already had solidified and him
deciding that he was going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he wanted to, he wanted to learn
in that scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to be a part of the best
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, you know, I don't want to
put words in his mouth because I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: had the opportunity to interview him,
but, but, um, you know, someone goes to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hotspot because they want to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can imagine that, um, he got so
excited that that's where a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: people got turned on to was like through
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I agree, you know,
and once his genetics started popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the forums and started popping up,
um, on the auto flower network,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it really gained him a lot of
credibility for what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so to answer your other question
about it being a state side company,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it really was a state side
company ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a way to get that flowing to
the state side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and maybe, maybe I just thought it
was a U S company because there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many of his seeds here and,
um, there is such a huge, um, following
[SPEAKER_01]: for him, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are, there are a handful of
good auto flower, uh, breeders putting out
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds now, no doubt, but I would say for,
for, you know, most folks, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mephisto is, you know, has been the top of
the mountain for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People wanted those seeds and,
and they were often sold out, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, makes everybody want them more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, in the last few years,
certainly there, there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: really excellent, you know, other people
breeding, including yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think that, um, Mephisto
deserves a lot of, um, respect for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for being some of the first folks to,
you know, um, really stabilize mass
[SPEAKER_01]: produce and get out these new auto flower,
uh, um, cultivars, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it in a savvy, cool way with
creative packaging and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging names and they, you know,
the whole, the whole package where it made
[SPEAKER_01]: it really easy to become like a fan boy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a different, it was
definitely a different approach that none
[SPEAKER_00]: of us had seen before, because I don't
know if you purchase seeds back around
[SPEAKER_00]: that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they had a, they may have came in
a snazzy like matchbox style, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: booklet with a glass vial in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, they may have some cultivar
information on the back, expected cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: times and expressions, but there was never
really a, um, marketing angle that what
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw with Mephisto, it was definitely
different than we had seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's kind of like,
that kind of brings it all together,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got, we've got all these new
genetics being developed in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now that the, you know, the actual
auto flower, you know, the recessive Rudy
[SPEAKER_01]: has been stabilized so that people could
just use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't have to do six or
seven years of, of, you know, breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: work to isolate that before even trying to
make their flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could just take somebody else's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then build their flavors on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these great, uh, all this,
all these great seeds coming out of Spain
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, and then, you know, uh,
Mitch and folks like Mitch going to Spain
[SPEAKER_01]: and spreading that information around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then auto flower network creating this
community where auto flower breeders could
[SPEAKER_01]: feel at home and share best practices
internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, boom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that is, that is the
turning point where the entire modern auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower scene come from, comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I definitely think that it was
a, you know, a trispoke thing where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like these three massive things came to a
head and it just kind of supernovaed from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, they started to get better
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivars were becoming better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually variety, you know,
it wasn't just short plant one and short
[SPEAKER_00]: plant three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually had some, you know,
real variety starting to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you were talking about
laying the foundation of the origin of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like we've talked about
earlier in this, it's a very gangly and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, runty style plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now for somebody to be able to
just give you picks and choices and
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions that you want, you could
really see how the foundation and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, let's go ahead and take our
first short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Dan Jimmy of
Mandalorian genetics and the auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxygen is an essential plant nutrient and
keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaia's brand of ultra fine nano bubble
systems will help your garden thrive in
[SPEAKER_01]: ways you may not have considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter if you grow in soil,
hydroponics or aquaponics, Gaia's ultra
[SPEAKER_01]: fine nano bubble systems will increase
your dissolved oxygen and increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often, the first sign of inadequate oxygen
supply to the roots is wilting of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant under warm conditions and high light
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insufficient oxygen results in an
accumulation of toxins and an insufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of water and mineral absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: If oxygen starvation continues,
mineral deficiencies will begin to show,
[SPEAKER_01]: roots die back, and plants will become
stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy roots supplied with sufficient
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions
[SPEAKER_01]: selectively from the surrounding solution
as required.
[SPEAKER_01]: In studies, this has shown a 30% increase
in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do ultra fine oxygen bubbles
allow your plants to thrive, but they will
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your drip lines and irrigation pipes
and plumbing clean too, because algae,
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium and other invasive species only
survive in low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Gaia system only costs about $2
per day to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaia ultra fine oxygen nanobubblers are
also great for making compost teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: wild crafted nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller bubbles of truly dissolved
oxygen allow more microbes to reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Gaia's website at h205.com to learn
more about using dissolved oxygen and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to purchase this simple yet amazing
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's h205.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry, and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_01]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.

[SPEAKER_01]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_01]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continued to refuse outside
investment that would change their company
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_01]: program, and their minimum starting wage
is 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive and pass testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Dan Jimmy of
Mandalorian genetics and the auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
this threshold moment in like 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011 time where we had this combination
of, you know, auto flowers becoming really
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized in Spain, people going to Spain
because they wanted to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: People then sending their seeds all around
the world and then people getting to know
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and best practices through the
auto flower network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all kind of came together at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, over these last,
you know, nine years or so since then,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen yields increase, terpene
profiles better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the plants are getting more
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious, Dan, what you are
seeing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you're a breeder's breeder,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you not only breed really excellent
auto flower plants that people enjoy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and are great for parents,
patients, and they look pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not only that, but you're also like,
you know, you help run auto flower network
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're a nerd, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are into the details of a lot of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping that you can give me a
good kind of overview of what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the different veins of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, as we know,
breeders work on different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the parts that interest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not involved enough in the auto
flower breeding scene to know what these
[SPEAKER_01]: other buckets are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just hand you the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why don't you just tell us what you
are seeing evolve here in the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let's say six years and where
you see people working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feel free to name drop if you want,
but mostly I want us all to have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what's being worked on and what's
novel in auto flowers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, you know, quickly the
things I can see is a potency increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: true terpene profile changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biggest thing is the
overall structure and flower to leaf ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: are the biggest three shifts I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently I've seen, you know,
in the earlier days, you see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was probably based off the low
rider or low rider to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it could have been done from the
sour 60 stuff we saw earlier, or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: road runners from dynathem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, you can see, even though it was
from these different brands and different
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, you could see some similarities
between those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is you see a lot
of the ruderalis, you know, still coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant size has increased, but we're
still seeing a lot of the morphology from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: May that be high leaf ratio, long extended
leaves from the main stem on your main
[SPEAKER_00]: fans up until now, where you actually can
tell a difference between a cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: through some breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've become more stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people that have put in the
most work are seeing more of a homozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cultivar expression per
tentative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I've seen that has
shifted is it used to be commonplace to
[SPEAKER_00]: get regular seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you got out of flowers back in
the early days, it was regular seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were very, very few feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a big milestone for
Mitch as well, was getting out mass
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of feminized seeds for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in the market, it's really,
really hard to find regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you seem to find is feminized out
of flowers, which is fine and dandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great because there's multiple
benefits and we can talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think those are the biggest things
that I've seen shift as well as potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I personally took my whistle
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several 18 to 25 percent THC
cultivars that are coming out where back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day you were lucky to see 13
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's been a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that comes with the selective
breeding that's been going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: People moving more away from the
traditional Ruderalis and just seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the day neutral trait rather than
getting to the out of flower trait
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that little insight you tossed in
there about the different strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders will have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some folks are taking hype strains
and just hitting it with the Rudy and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting something out, which, you know,
may be a faster, you know, Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may not be, I don't know,
finished, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, yes, you successfully made the
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but there's something extra to it to,
I don't know, sculpt the terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it's more than the hype name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whereas other folks are not looking to
reproduce the hype name and they're coming
[SPEAKER_01]: at it from a different direction,
you know, independently, not trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate something else, but instead to
create something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that that neither I'm
not saying that just hitting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hype strain with, you know, Ruderalis is
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that because I have grown a
lot of fun stuff that way, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm pointing out is that it's a
different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a, you know, it's a very specific
breeding strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just a different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you know, you can have
several cooks in one kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have one dish they got to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody gets to that point
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even we get this even in
regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got people who are they're taking
their Uber mail and they're hitting the
[SPEAKER_01]: time the 10 hot strains that they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing, you know, all 10 of
those versus this one Uber mail versus
[SPEAKER_01]: people who every project they've got has
got different mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so as you are as you were seeing these
these different attributes come out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, when did you start to see that
period where people were starting to start
[SPEAKER_01]: to be picked up more at retail?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like like no doubt when they started
making so many feminized autoflower seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got picked up really quickly by the
by the patient market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there really isn't a better
patient home grow plant than a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the easiest of easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, you know, I teach that
to the patients that I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, you need a safe place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your safest place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't necessarily mean that
that's where when people when when
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflower breeders used to like more
successfully actually get money for their
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's one thing trading with your
friends because the market isn't there for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the day that comes that
people start buying the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you when do you think that
started?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I bought my my first autoflower
seeds all the way back back in 2009 when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first got when I got involved with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from the Attitude Seed Bank that
you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still had some options available,
but it wasn't as widespread as today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I keep repeating Dutch Passion
and Dynafem, but those two are so stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: my memory from just the wow factor seeing
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several other great brands
that I know I'm forgetting to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I want to say Nirvana was
another location you could find them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you could buy them as early as
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the larger influx came
probably 12, 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the forum started getting more
momentum and, you know, Mephisto was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting momentum and then the market was
kind of driving itself that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could be off a little bit with those
dates as far as like the mass boom of when
[SPEAKER_00]: everything took off for that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from my memory and if my memory serves
me right, you know, I know it was
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in between 2011 and 2020 that it
really, really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could buy them back as early as
2009 on Attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the Ruderalis taste,
to what degree do you think the Ruderalis
[SPEAKER_01]: taste is still prevalent in all of the
auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does seem to be different from
breeder to breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is influencing how much
you're tasting the grassy Rudy in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's breeder selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is, you know, dependent upon
what they're looking for as a result part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, what the parent inputs were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I spoke about this earlier about
the higher leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruderalis is known to have high leafy
content in between its buds, therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you more chlorophyll, which in
turn, if it's not dried and cured
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, gives you a lot more of that
grass hay taste to the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with the improvement of,
you know, the calyx to leaf ratios on
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, we're seeing a lot of that
dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what's happening when
people are doing selective breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: an outside source, maybe another photo
period or something of that nature where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not continuance of the Rudy gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put you on the spot here,
which is probably not fair, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask you to name drop some of the
breeders that you think are doing good
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to preempt this by saying that,
you know, I recommend that everybody go to
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you're interested in
growing autoflowers or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in breeding them, that is the
place to go because that is where I went
[SPEAKER_01]: to find the seeds that were being made by
talented people that may not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: have the commercial push behind them yet,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the autoflower for sale scene is
still very young.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're still buying from a lot of
individuals either via mail or at a
[SPEAKER_01]: convention or a big smoke sesh or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a really great place to buy
is to go and look at the plants and read
[SPEAKER_01]: the threads and find out the person who
you dig their style and then buy direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no question also that there
are a couple really good seed banks now
[SPEAKER_01]: that are bringing people together to
represent them, to take some of the sales
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the sales stress off of the
breeders themselves, because just because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a breeder does not mean that you
are a great marketer of your own stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you got to have respect for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all that being said, and my
encouraging people to hunt out breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: that are maybe less commercial,
why don't you plug a couple of folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: you appreciate their work for people who
are looking to start with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a good first autoflower
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few that come to the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want a good first experience,
there's a company out there called Night
[SPEAKER_00]: Owl Seeds, which is run by Das.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has done some phenomenal work,
has been trained by one of the best to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce autofelms and his stuff sells out
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the hardest, one of the
hardest cultivar lineups to get your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they come up for sale, they
immediately sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely think that that's a good place
that people should start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend, Brother Mendel's
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based out of the middle of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not so much on in the seed banks,
but if you search them out on Facebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, you'll find some beautiful,
beautiful worked cultivars from these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're autofelms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with some, I'm working with
some of them myself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really has a passion behind it,
like Das and myself, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of have that same visionary style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a friend out here in Eastern
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an up and coming breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Fire Buds Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend of mine, actually have been
mentoring him for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trade some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some really good work coming out
from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are, I'd say up in my top three,
of what you can find locally that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, approaching it in a different style
to make a better plant for the community
[SPEAKER_00]: at whole.
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I've just seen a lot
of their stuff expanding with the green
[SPEAKER_00]: wave coming, and it's nice to see that
happen with guys that are passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and really put the time into work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're a humble dude,
but I will also say that, plug your
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandalorian genetics, because I love
growing purple plants, and you do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, lots of candy smells, and reliable
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have grown a lot of them here on
Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say we, I mean folks who are
patients on the island who are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with their medical certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been so kind as to donate seeds
to our local Vimea meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so patients have been able to get some
of your seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really nice to see if so many
people have a good first time experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with auto flowers, especially here in the
Pacific Northwest, where you often have
[SPEAKER_01]: summers like we did this summer,
where nothing photo period finished,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the weather was so bad,
and nights got cold so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by all means, oh, and your stuff wins
awards too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll trash on awards a different day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is something to be said when your
stuff's winning awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mandalorian is well to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like what you said, though,
about the auto flower scene being lifted
[SPEAKER_01]: up by the green rush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that auto flowers are really
the right place at the right time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're so much more home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And auto flowers are so convenient for
newbie home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feminized seeds are convenient for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people still prefer the reg
seeds, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so many people, when ease is their
number one thing, a feminized auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: is the top of the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is cool to see some other people
helping push the auto flower tide forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's talk a little bit about the
auto flower cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I unfortunately missed the auto flower
cup the last time I had the opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: two years ago, because I was actually
running a panel at Cultivation Classic on
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't get to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have to tell me all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who's behind the auto flower cup,
and what have we seen so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 2019 cup was down in the Grants
Pass, Oregon area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was put together by a gentleman of the
name of James Hastings.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, I wasn't too familiar with him
before the word started buzzing around
[SPEAKER_00]: that this cup was going to be put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put the cup together for five days
down in Oregon on a campground that was
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis friendly, which was really,
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the things that I take from
that experience were, one, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time that I'd been around that kind
of event.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like, everybody's there for the
same minded goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's there to share their cannabis
cultivation and exchange information and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like bringing the forum alive,
because I got to meet a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only known screen names for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their personalities outside of that
screen name was just an amazing way to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were the same way on the forum
because they all cared about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an experience like,
it'll be one of those ones for me to go
[SPEAKER_00]: down like, I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met so many great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have been a little bit better
planned for events over five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just being honest, we're pretty
much, we're like free to roam anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: down there because it's absolutely
gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lakes, there were hiking
trails, all kinds of stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it came down time for like,
you know, competition and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: people were doing their testing and,
you know, it was basically people's
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we entered into it without all
the hype, I think, that you sometimes see
[SPEAKER_00]: behind larger competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice, like a communal thing to
where people that had been putting in all
[SPEAKER_00]: this work for all this time and talking to
each other, we were able to come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: show our best and just have a good time
over a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really long time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like even a three-day event feels
long by day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a five day, when you add,
you know, the campground and the forest
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, we're in Oregon,
so there were probably mushies everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how, you know, a good summertime
campout is going to be even more than the
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a, it actually sounds more
like an auto flower rainbow gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, to be completely honest with
you, you know, everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed the hikes and the fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just kind of like this powwow
with a award ceremony at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason it was done for
five days is a lot of this stuff wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've seen different framework as
far as these competitions go where the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers sent out way ahead of time and
people have weeks to mull over the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is where the one spot
where it was lacking was because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything had to be tested over those
five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what gave it its length.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it could have been done a
little sooner as far as testing because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on your amount of
entries, that's a lot of cannabis to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through without having some kind of like
entrees effect or, you know, overlap of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give some love to Jeff Lowenfels
about his auto flower book too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, one of the challenges
the auto flower community has is just
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching outside of the auto flower
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so insular and we, you know,
we trade genetics and we trade stories and
[SPEAKER_01]: we trade best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of it is kind of like inward
focusing, which kind of slows the
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion of the scene, which may be for
the better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it makes that, you know,
primarily authentic, very interested
[SPEAKER_01]: people get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, if we want the scene
to grow and if we want people to buy auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower seeds from the people putting in
the work, the word's got to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, so anybody who doesn't
know, Jeff Lowenfels is known as Lord of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put out a seminal series of books
all about living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard of teaming with
microbes, teaming with nutrition and
[SPEAKER_01]: teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they are a baseline of
understanding well, growing anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but certainly growing cannabis in
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't read them, you should check
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jeff got all turned on to auto flowers
living up in Alaska and just generally
[SPEAKER_01]: being a, you know, 40 plus year gardening
nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he put out this book on auto
flowers and it was an interesting book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us, Dan, about the
interesting direction that Jeff took it
[SPEAKER_01]: and who his book ended up actually being
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in a nutshell, ended up being
the introduction for people to give an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower try for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I have to laugh because,
you know, I was excited about the book
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out and, you know, somebody with
Jeff's caliber stepping into the limelight
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that you were talking
about, we have been, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shadows with for so long was
amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you talked about how like
it's so much, you know, inclusive with the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, you know, done a couple
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, like you said, we haven't really got
out there until somebody like Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two, it's also created this weird bond
amongst the breeders and the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: take it passionately to kind of watch out
for one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jeff's exposure to the auto flower
approach, I think was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he joked with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him I was buying the book and I was
honored enough to have a few pictures in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was awesome to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, I had to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept telling me, he's like,
no, Dan, he's like, this book isn't for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it's not for people who already
understand the cultivation of the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for your aunt or your uncle or your
crazy cousin who wants to get in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing some homegrown and take an
easier approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think Jeff hit the nail
on the head with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read through it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's made he's made a nice
introductory way of people to know what an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower is, see the basic mechanics of
the plant and what to do with it when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just with Jeff, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, you know, you stepping out
into the limelight with the several
[SPEAKER_00]: different seminars that you have done to
discuss auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you between Jeff and yourself,
you have given the auto flower community
[SPEAKER_00]: that outward shining light that,
hey, these guys are over here doing
[SPEAKER_00]: miraculous things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think you guys should love it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think your approach with the live
seminars and the shaping fire recordings
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have done about the auto flowers
is really given a broader spectrum of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do and what they can do
for either a commercial setting or the
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown and patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, thanks for saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I think that Jeff and I come from
the same place where we are both like
[SPEAKER_01]: giddy and excited about auto flowers and
what it can do for home growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we you know, neither of us are
breeders, but we're so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to talk to people about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, he he wrote a book about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was how he, you know, voiced himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I I programmed all of twenty
nineteen with like auto flower events that
[SPEAKER_01]: were free for folks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what I was able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in the end, we all want the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want we want the breeders to get the
recognition that they deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the hard work that they're putting in
and these beautiful plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: designing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure that people who
have any kind of interest in growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis have can grow cannabis so they
know how to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, hell, we all want
cannabis to be in gardens as commonly as
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way we can do that is if
we've got, you know, breeders breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know, like like Jeff and I and
you, telling people that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, there's nothing like
throwing events to be able to meet new
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like I met so many great people,
you know, like like like, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: at Indo Expo, I was giving a talk on on
auto flowers and why people should try
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and Daz was there, you know,
and like, you know, I had heard about Daz
[SPEAKER_01]: Mephisto and followed him and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he came up after the after the
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's all like, hey, man, nice to meet
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it wasn't my best
performance, but it was you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was cool to turn people on to stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was nice to meet people who I look
up to in the scene like Daz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good, good folks who are doing
good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's that's part of what
makes auto flowers so good is because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has been so ignored for so long
that really there aren't a lot of assholes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are really nice to each other
because we've all been on the the edge
[SPEAKER_01]: edges for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the second part I was talking
about earlier is just kind of it's formed
[SPEAKER_00]: a bond between all of us to where,
yeah, I haven't I've met a few that were a
[SPEAKER_00]: little persnickety, but I've never met
like that elitist mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, you've experienced this and
you've worked with them in this long and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can both avoid that by doing this at
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's almost like the forums have
shifted into real life, because one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main mindsets that we wanted to create on
the auto flower network was a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: better term, a safe place where you come
in and share that knowledge and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get, you know, barked at by 15,
20 other people telling you you're stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: and that all the flowers are shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a place and it was
amazing to watch the morphology of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, because after that tone was set and
the site started to gain its momentum,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the admin didn't have to step in the
general population by going, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: room for that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not here for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool to hear you see that come
out in real life, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the auto flower network,
while I don't spend a lot of time there
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't breed, I love just going
and reading threads to learn best growing
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, for the jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the folks there are really
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we come back, we're going to talk
about breeding with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not going to go into it heavy
duty science approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I do want to talk about why
breeding auto flowers is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the unexpected challenges and and
mostly why why we need to make sure we
[SPEAKER_01]: have respect for these auto flower
breeders, because because this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Dan Jimmy of
Mandalorian Genetics and the Auto Flower
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you certainly don't have the time for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not ready to hire somebody full
time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend blunt branding at
Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten Nelson and her team are focused on
improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they leave responsibility for
improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_01]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.

growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlaski and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,

[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up

product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_01]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Dan Jimmy of
Mandalorian Genetics and the Auto Flower
[SPEAKER_01]: Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to bring this show on home,
what we're going to talk about next is the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual breeding of the auto flowers,
because it is not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've made seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I get a male plant I like and a
female plant I like, and I put them near
[SPEAKER_01]: each other or I apply some pollen with a
paintbrush and, ooh, I've made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just fun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel closer to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started listening to breeders
talk about breeding auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is that for the
passionate people I know in the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: community for auto flowers, they ain't no
thing to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is just expected to get
something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love them for it because I get to
pop their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a good thing for growing
growers to know what's behind the secret
[SPEAKER_01]: sauce so they can properly value these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Dan, why don't you walk us through
what the breeding of an auto flower looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll approach it in two different
ways, and we'll keep it at a high level
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can get a generalistic
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did mention, and I'll start with the
simplicity first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did mention about you take your
favorite cultivar and male and then
[SPEAKER_00]: female, put them beside each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get seeds from that run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And auto flower to auto flower is pretty
much going to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are somebody who is wanting to
experience pollen chucking to see how this
[SPEAKER_00]: takes place, if you have a 100% auto
flower female and 100% auto flower male,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you let them pollinate each other,
you will get 100% auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that said, you're going to get a
lot of genetic variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect all kinds of different
phenotypical expressions showing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a high level, and if you just want
to experience that process and be
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and make your own seeds,
that's one way you can approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the more in-depth side of it,
and it's the side that you were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about with the complexity levels,
is I think the more current breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to it is taking a photo period,
male or female, and introducing it to an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you do so, you have a lot of
work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is you have
generational selections that have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: place in order for you to make that plant
a true auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the earlier auto flowers
that were done this way were done with the
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation of bringing out the auto
flowering trait first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking earlier, the hype
strains, you want to get that fast
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cookies out there or the fast
flowering GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quickest way to do that is make
your initial parental selections and then
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreed looking for the auto flower trait
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking more to change the
morphology and get rid of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ruderalis, I think there's a lot more of a
selection process that has to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that selection process,
I'll cover that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your initial cross is going to give you
your F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those F1 seeds are going to be primarily
dominant in the photoperiod lines genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very rare for you to see
a fully auto flowering expression out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that first round of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you ask yourself, well,
what do I do to make that show up?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best option there is to inbreed that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is you take a male
and a female from that first generation
[SPEAKER_00]: and inbreed them together, giving you your
F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the F2 generation, you're going to
start seeing mom similarities from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may even see some auto flowering
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that, I will caution you back to
what we were talking about, breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly for just the auto flowering trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your end goal, start looking at
the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find one that is going to go
full auto flower and one that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stalls out from the auto flower,
it'll grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start to pre flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into what I call bud set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it needs 12-12 to finish its life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I think that would be a
good selection for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just hunting something that's
going to come out in an auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion, that would be my next round to
select from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to kind of incorporate
what you really liked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod mom, but you want just the
auto flowering genetic from the father or
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa, I think you need to start
really digging into your seed count at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the F2, look for something that's doing
the stall on both sexes, both male,
[SPEAKER_00]: female, and then push that to the third
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the third generation, you could
probably start seeing a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a balance between auto flowering and some
that still may be photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start picking at that
point based upon your terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower densities, your expressions of
leaf color, whatever tickles your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then making your F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: By F4, if you select in that manner,
you should see really close to 100% auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more time intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more sifting through seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a good possibility if you pick
up that nature or if you pick up that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, that you're going to have to go
through quite a few seeds to find what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want if you want to represent both parents
truthfully, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it takes to F4 just to get all of
the seeds to be auto flower, do we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go further than that to also lock down
some of the individual traits or like
[SPEAKER_01]: taste traits, shall we say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be selecting for both at the same
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be selecting for both the auto
flower traits and the yield and potency
[SPEAKER_01]: traits at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you need to choose which ones first?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could do it all at the same
time if you're taking good notes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing you need a big sift too.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm asking the question, I'm all like,
oh, you can choose for both if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're trying to do this with 20
seeds, you're going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: limited than if you're trying to do this
with 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was talking about
earlier, having that sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you're wanting to do a true
photo to autocross, have your end goal and
[SPEAKER_00]: have your mindset where you want to be at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can definitely do that sifting and
hunt out the multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see one that goes to pre-flower and
stalls, but it has the leaf structure you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a balance on each side that you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant itself looks balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some nice symmetry in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you might have color from the
other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, OK, I want the color too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could do that as part of your
sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what's creating the
more modern day autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what a lot more the
approach is, rather than seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: new stuff come out that's, yeah,
it's autoflower, but it still kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like ruteralis, but it's had a
different photoparent that worked as in
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, needing to work something to f4
or further is definitely further if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to have a lot of sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you're going to be doing a
lot of cycles and selecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a fair assumption to say that a lot
more of the autoflower folks are
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating indoor breeding over the
winters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with a lot of the photo period
stuff, people can just grow outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: during the summer and get work done enough
that over a couple seasons, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: develop something really good for the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you need to get to f4 before all of
your seeds are even showing the autoflower
[SPEAKER_01]: trait, that tells me that to get anything
done in your lifetime, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be growing in multiple tents
indoors at the same time as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching for expressions under the sun
during the summer and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the one key thing that we
need as breeders is the indoor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separated space especially, because I
mean, yes, pollen is highly volatile,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are easy steps to contain and
control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take around the clock,
year-round work, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did ask in the earlier question,
and I didn't touch on it, but I'd like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you asked about continuing the F
generations for stabilization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to answer that question is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work that I have done is in
the neighborhoods of f6, f7, f8,
[SPEAKER_00]: and f9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really around f5 or f6,
I'm starting to see that balance across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do you have the years of work
or the timeframe of work just to get what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want, then you have to stabilize it to
a point where it's become that same or
[SPEAKER_00]: close to same cultivaral expression across
the 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's not like Pokemon and you
open it up and there's 15 different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to steal that one from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure you had a meme on
that at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those different animals together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, dude, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now that people are getting
an idea of what it would take,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that people are falling into at
least two categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one category of folks who,
they just want to understand auto flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to grow some,
and they want to sound cool talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: their friends about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's another basket,
which are people who are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I want to try breeding some auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this idea I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got these tastes I want to bring out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you tell, what are the steps
that you would tell somebody to do if they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to get involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that there's probably a
thread on auto flower net that's dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are people using as the
ruderalis input nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that there's some kind of
stabilized option that most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: working with that's hard to screw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a majority of the people I think
are using the predefined auto flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that have been worked for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people are going
back to pure ruderalis for their
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation because that takes a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a whole lot of work because
you're not only just hunting the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, you're hunting the auto flower
trade from the original ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're also dealing with is all of
the other genetic recessive traits of low
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, bad yield, funky growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they are wanting to learn about it,
I definitely think get out there and find
[SPEAKER_00]: some regular seeds and put them side by
side to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to get into the depth,
I would get out there and I would look for
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable breeders and especially
independent breeders because the
[SPEAKER_00]: independent breeders tend to have more
regulars, which I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: before, which are really, really hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a lot of people out there
offering regular auto flowers these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have a foundation without the
complexity of understanding how to
[SPEAKER_00]: feminize a seed, you need to have a male
counterpart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to plug Heart Rock Mountain right
now because that's where I've been... His
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and your seeds are the stuff that
I've been getting that's regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually kind of an interesting
upside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of the Dragonfly Earth
Medicine regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the moment, most of their people
are shying away from making feminine
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're putting out lots of auto
flowers, but they're all regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can find a seed breeder
who's playing with auto flowers that's
[SPEAKER_01]: also Dragonfly certified, it's like
hitting a gold rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Heart Rock Mountain farms,
their Lion's Claw is one of the first ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I personally came across that truly
hits like funk and gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's just the stuff that I've
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've probably only grown 45 or 50 auto
flower cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you find gas is kind of still
missing in auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't come across... I come across the
sweets and the candies and the bubble gums
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cheeses and the northern cheese
hazes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't found a ton of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally haven't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few different cultivars and I
got one that smells like acetone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first chemical smelling
auto flower that I had ever personally
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've obviously been to a few different
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends that have been growing
auto cultivars for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, the floral, the berries,
the fruits, the candies, are really coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the more modern day auto is
leaning that way because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting...
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders that are working with them
are... The ones that are taking their time
[SPEAKER_00]: are in search of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think we're going to start
seeing more of a gassy... Because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that I've been approached and
asked the most, honestly, by people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are interested in growing these in large
scale is, so where are the terpenes at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the gas at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that fuel smell because that's
what the public wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even think even the home grower
wants that for a nostalgic reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a very common nose profile
that we often associate to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting there, but I don't think
it's full-fledged hammered there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still have some work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that you're right on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's use that to transition here
to kind of a wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see the auto flower scene
going right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the major trends that you think
are going to play themselves out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out over the next couple of years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is just the uprise in the home
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of a bunch of different groups,
a bunch of different forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see as each new state is going
legal, either medicinally or adding
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational to their medicinal sort of
legalities, a lot of home growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: really starting to pick it up because they
can literally put a two by four tent in
[SPEAKER_00]: their closet with an LED and get at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back in the day, we would grow
them in PC cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean like computer cases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just take a large computer
case, got the internals, rig up some
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent lights inside of it and let it
go to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing the plant evolve from that into
the home grow, I definitely think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see a huge influx there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm already seeing it based upon
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, if you are the other
platforms, you really see the home growers
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbing a hold of the auto flower,
especially now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states are legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second wave and what I'm really
seeing is supplemental for farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in out talks specifically to
our climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our climate in this northern section is
similar to the one that's over in Maine
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of central US, Michigan and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing farmers use them to
supplement either their veg space during
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter because they're an all outdoor
facility and they veg their moms over the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do their cuttings and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're producing a yield during the
same time they're flowering out or not
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering out, excuse me, vegging out
their next year's crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor facilities are filling their mother
rooms with auto flowers while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for their clones to take and get
ready for the bloom room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adding another layer of revenue for
the company with extremely low overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you and I know, and Jeff speaks
about it in the book, they don't need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll caveat that there are a few out
there as the selective breeding is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place that they do need some food,
they need a little bit more attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that's with any kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm seeing that wave hit the large
scale farm market too from coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting to see how they're
being used as a tool and some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it as flower and a lot of them are
doing it for extracts, maybe hash rosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe for cartridges, for edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of different options happening
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm seeing those two direct avenues
really starting to move through with the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto wave, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to see folks who
ordinarily would not be into auto flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly warm up to them and start growing
in them when they realize that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: start your auto flowers early in May that
they'll finish in the same time of year
[SPEAKER_01]: that a light dep would and so you actually
have flower to bring to the market that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh and usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even just if you're doing outdoors
on a less quality part of your property
[SPEAKER_01]: because they actually, being from Siberia,
a lot of these plants really like to be
[SPEAKER_01]: abused and have stones in the soil and
just be kind of ganky soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then other folks who are doing indoor,
they realize that, oh, wow, we can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: autos in our mother room or in our veg
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are light independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're vegging out and you're holding your
mothers at either 18.6 or 24, any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: higher variation and these guys are just
going through their mechanics and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just need a little bit of water along the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that as they are increasingly
picked up by, I don't know, let's call
[SPEAKER_01]: them commercial tastemakers, as the bigger
players are bringing out auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: early season offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the last vestiges of auto
flower taboo will go away and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be part of the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be like regs, light dep and
auto flowers and they're all going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said a minute ago,
it's slowly changing one mind at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people that were so hell bent about
it's ditch weed, oh, it's just that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's low rider to actually
watching them grow and then they see it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so yeah, it's not the same thing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a person who is a
disbeliever and say, here, here's 50
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, grow them, let me know what you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that usually helps turn the
mind around and, you know, providing
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and COAs, you know, that really
helps too because, you know, your
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial taste makers love to see
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they see numbers and everything
lines up to their model, I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: more apt to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate that sometimes it takes that
depth of transition, but sometimes it just
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people need a little bit more proof,
but they're slowly coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To use your example, you give somebody 50
seeds and they look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will look at auto flowers all with
new eyes because they'll see a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenos, some of which they'll
like, they'll see the increased
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency versus what it was like before
2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll smoke it and go like,
damn though, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since, you know, it's,
it's a misnomer that potency is the end
[SPEAKER_01]: all anyway, you know, like THC potency and
a lot, you know, you can get stuff in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mid teens with good terpene profiles that
just give you a fantastic buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people who are demanding,
you know, you know, 28, 29, 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're missing the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and since auto flowers don't do those
kinds of numbers, if you're, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cozy up to auto flowers,
it's also teaches you that you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of THC potency numbers either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I agree with you and thank
you so much for saying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had stuff that's been in the lower
percentage, you know, from a, a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period plant that, you know, it might
have, it had, you know, just enough
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the right amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was enough synergy there to melt my
face off to where like you smoke a 31% and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like, oh, you know, it's,
it's, there's something else going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there over than just potency or even
trichrome coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the other thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that was one of the,
that's one of the biggest reps that autos
[SPEAKER_00]: get is, oh, they lack trichromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that at a beneficial point for
hash making, but like, I also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that that's fully translated into
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, since you mentioned hash,
one of the things that I personally like
[SPEAKER_01]: about auto flowers is in my experience,
they don't nug up the same way that many
[SPEAKER_01]: photo periods do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're, they're a little looser
and I think they hash great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, because the, the internal trichomes
are so much easier to get cold and to
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, drop off and leave the
actual material without having to beat it
[SPEAKER_01]: all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that auto flowers are great for
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I, I've got some experience or,
you know, had some really good experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: with returns on, you know, either ice
water hash or even dry ice hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot better breakage because I
think exactly what is happening is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you said is you, they don't get super
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some out there that do,
but a majority don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more surface area of good
trichrome heads that you can actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: into rather than having to pulverize it
and release a lot of the chlorophyll too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Dan, thank you so much for joining
me, especially on this like quiet and
[SPEAKER_01]: sleepy Sunday morning after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you sharing your time
and your experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, honestly, you know,
I knew I wanted to do this show about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the, the history of auto flowers so
that we could, you know, get this into the
[SPEAKER_01]: history books before it's, uh,
either lost or become more before some big
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower company, you know,
commoditizes the story and claims that
[SPEAKER_01]: they invented auto flowers, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's not, there's not a lot of
people who were there at the early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, luckily you were, and,
uh, you know, your involvement with auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower dot net gave you a, um,
you know, gives you a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, thanks for taking your time to
share that with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, thanks for just generally
being a dude with good share who
[SPEAKER_01]: represents the auto flower community
positively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you tremendously for having me
on this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, love what you do and the
involvement with the community and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how we first met with your Vimeo
events over on the island and seeing your
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion to the people, as well as the
plant and spreading good knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I held you in high regard and
especially the guests that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your time this morning
and bringing me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to follow up on this stuff
that we've been talking about today,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, here's a whole bunch of avenues for
you to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, first and foremost, um, I recommend
that you follow, uh, Dan Jimmy's
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, which is, um, unendingly
interesting and has beautiful flower
[SPEAKER_01]: photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on Instagram at Mandalorian
underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, also, uh, you want to probably
want to check out auto flower.net,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the forum where you're going to
learn all about your best practices and up
[SPEAKER_01]: and coming breeders and see great photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as you get into auto flower
growing and breeding, if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, that is a fabulous community to
be a member of very warm, uh, very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low amount of trolls, just a really
great heartfelt community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you want to, uh, uh, get more of
Dan Jimmy, um, you can, you can enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube video that is on, um, my Shango
Los YouTube channel of Dan before he was
[SPEAKER_01]: using his, uh, his, his, his government
name, I guess, uh, of, of Dan Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he, he did a special video with
another friend of ours, uh, Sebring,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, um, all about, um, giving seeds away
to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and you know, for those of you
who listen to this show, um, the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: focused breeding and patient focus growing
is very important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these two guys both, um, both,
uh, make seeds to give away and also
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate other people giving away their
seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you can, you can find that,
uh, giveaway growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of the video is called giveaway
seeds on, uh, on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can also listen to earlier shaping
fire episodes that had to do with auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was, uh, episode 47,
uh, which was, uh, the very first shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire alive that was at a cultivation
classic in, uh, Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my guests for that are Jeff
Lowenfels, who wrote the book we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about earlier, and Seth Crawford,
who is a, um, an auto flower breeder from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Oregon CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they focus on making auto flowers for
the hemp market, but the two of them
[SPEAKER_01]: together on, on stage not only was,
uh, insightful for, uh, both, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growers and home growers,
but they're also both funny as hell dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a good presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can find the video version of that
on YouTube or you can just listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire episode 47 and audio only
because it works either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you can also check out
episode, uh, shaping fire 53, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: all about, uh, recruiting new cannabis
gardeners with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my interview with Jeff
Lowenfels about his book and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and about how we, uh, you know,
through things like his book, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to expand the auto flower scene,
which I got to admit, I'm very proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me to, uh, to write a testimonial
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my first, first book I'm on the
jacket cover on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you also on the shaping fire,
um, YouTube channel, you can see my own
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation on why auto flowers are
useful to patients, uh, recorded,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, one version of it in Portland,
uh, Indo Expo and another version,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Indo Expo, Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are both on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, if you, if you want to,
uh, get direct links to any of this or
[SPEAKER_01]: links to a heart rock mountain farm that I
mentioned, or the Fisto genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we mentioned, um, all of those links
