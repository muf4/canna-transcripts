[SPEAKER_01]: So this next question, you know,
this is definitely a hot topic around here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Humboldt where we're talking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, in this time of transition,
folks are getting their licenses and so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going full on adult use rec.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other people who either
haven't gotten their licenses yet or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still getting their action
together to apply for their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're noticing is that some of
those people who have grabbed the brass
[SPEAKER_01]: ring and they've got their license,
they're starting to turn in and snitch on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other people who are in the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have not gotten their license yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you're known as your old
school heritage OG grower, but also you're
[SPEAKER_01]: a community builder, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, what do you feel about what's
going on with people throwing other people
[SPEAKER_01]: under the bus simply because they haven't
gotten their license yet, but at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, a lot of them aren't
supposed to be growing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a challenging conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a concept of, we talked about
earlier, scarcity and abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing is you're seeing
people who are basically snitching,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not from our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the new wave of people that come
in and they're doing normal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them, normal business is to snuff
out the black market around you because
[SPEAKER_00]: those are competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they cut into your margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have shareholders, you have
investors that need to be paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very impersonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the way we know it in American
capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that so many of us that
are in cannabis really were in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in a communal business where you
all basically shared resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you needed product, you could buy from
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically would create each other's
little safety and security blanket and
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the- You shared the risk too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shared the risk too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also made sure that, you know,
you weren't looking over your neighbor's
[SPEAKER_00]: fence trying to rat him out for what he
did because you didn't want him to rat you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you worked on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of need each other and we also
would prefer if we didn't cause each other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're really seeing is I think
that the majority of people that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: after with the customer, what do you call
it, complaint driven response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you contact the sheriff's department.
[SPEAKER_00]: You contact the BCC and say, look,
this is some unethical operators that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's primarily all the new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they don't have a connection
to the old game, they don't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: emotional situation that precludes them
from making these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's chewing up all these people that
are trying to move forward, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed down because they lack the capital
and they lack so many of the little pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to move expeditiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I just, I don't look at it
as we're really enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people don't understand
the level of a competitor that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if you looked at your neighbor
and thought that he was stealing profit
[SPEAKER_00]: from you, you should take a good look down
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Nabisco comes in and they're
going to steal all of it from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could not rat him out,
your neighbor out, you might find that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were valuable asset to help you when
you had problems, that you were somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could share genetic ideas with,
that you could work with creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with how do we function and
utilize each other's skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in our area, Humboldt
County, other counties like Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the communities like Humboldt,
where it was so much more group related,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the way we've learned how to function
and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the way we need to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would discourage people from
snitching on their neighbors and let the
[SPEAKER_00]: system do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ratting doesn't help anybody in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it does is removes all the smart
people around you, except you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: not that big either if you have the time
to get on the phone and rat out your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not busy enough on your job
and you have time to snitch, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go back to working on your job and
find where your missing profit is because
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighbor's not stealing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a friend in Temecula hit me up
and a neighbor ratted him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a misdemeanor charge for it
because he had excess plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it did not have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, this is hate and discontent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's people saying, because they're
encouraging the hotlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the hotlines where you can call
and no repercussions if it's a bad tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such police state shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not a good way to cultivate
relationships with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't ever agree with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fundamentally people are trying to
support their children just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were, snitching to me is if
your neighbor is kidnapping children and
[SPEAKER_00]: women and putting them in the basement,
that's not snitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's community service because they're
going to get your children next or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get your neighbor's children
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be your wife in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just called protecting yourself
from sociopaths in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities always did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not when someone's working on
something and you're like, I had to do all
[SPEAKER_00]: this because it's anger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's anger driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how dare you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to punish you because I feel
punished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that is just, you're not even
in cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so far off of the cannabis concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well be selling anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on commoditized business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, once you do that,
you're no longer in the world I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, oh, they're definitely
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are definitely using the phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
