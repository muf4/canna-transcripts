[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Tyler Marquardt and I am here
today via Shango Lose and Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to show you how to make bubble
hash using a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of more on a way of entry level or in
a position in which maybe you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to every single tool that these
multi-million dollar facilities have that
[SPEAKER_01]: you may see on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think this is an important way to help
people kind of get into the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: get into the hash making and just making
hash for yourself as a medical patient or
[SPEAKER_01]: just a home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different tools out there
and ways to make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it by hand, you can make it
by using the machine and this way is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to show you an efficient way to
bring that home and we'll be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: really high quality hash at your disposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we're going to be talking about
the different types of tools we use,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be talking about the
different types of material, all the steps
[SPEAKER_01]: that go into the production of this hash
using this machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 20 gallon washing machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an older model that I gifted
Shango years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using it every year for
probably the last five years to make hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've seen other videos where we've
used it with the material that's come out
[SPEAKER_01]: and so this is a great machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already in the last, they handle
up to about 900 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably put about 1,000 grams of
material in there and they would still put
[SPEAKER_01]: out a high quality product but nonetheless
you can get these used for a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred dollars off of Craigslist,
you can get them new offline for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred dollars as well, probably up to
500 bucks with shipping and what not.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of these days here the price has
changed pretty quickly but 20 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: machines are great to go with if you're
running some bigger outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more than a couple thousand
grams of material and you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: through it in a couple days, this is a
great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't produce that much material
all at once and you're getting it over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, there are also five gallon machines
that are available too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're smaller, they work just as well,
they're efficient and they get you a good
[SPEAKER_01]: material to start with to get your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also can do hand washing too by using
a power drill or just a spatula and
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the material around with your
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people actually will get into
this later, prefer that method because it
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you what you would consider a much
higher quality product because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: less agitation and you're getting the most
ripe trichomes off the head of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to get the highest
quality and the most material all at once,
[SPEAKER_01]: the machine is the best option to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another tool that's super important that
you need is going to be a garbage can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will say, okay, garbage cans
are not the ideal, you need to use food
[SPEAKER_01]: grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, ideally using food grade everything
would be the optimal thing to do but
[SPEAKER_01]: again, not everybody has access to food
grade quality materials and they still
[SPEAKER_01]: want to try to make hash and is this going
to give you a tainted product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time it may degrade and leach but if
you're running the first few times and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot, it's not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing it for years and we're
still running marathons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you always want to try to lean
towards the best practices and refine your
[SPEAKER_01]: technique as you go along using better
tools but if you're in a position and a
[SPEAKER_01]: limited budget, if you're a medical
patient like myself, you may not have a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of money to invest all at once and
thousands of dollars of equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a great option and way to go to
get where you need to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The garbage can is an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can work your way up to food grade
tubs and stainless steel is also another
[SPEAKER_01]: great option as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, stainless steel is expensive but
you can go to restaurant stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: use restaurant stores and find equipment
there as well too for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need a dull knife or a
straight blade, anything that has a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: inches that you can use to scrape a
material off with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a ceramic blade, not very sharp
which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to cut the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often like to use two so that when I do
scrape, I can scrape off using that and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also sometimes a large spoon is a
great option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great option to help scoop out and
or shave off any of the stuff that you got
[SPEAKER_01]: on your knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pizza box is also going to be helpful if
you can access that or cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza boxes are really easy to use because
they're convenient, they have a lid,
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps material out from getting in and
the cardboard itself will help absorb some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the water that is left over in the
bubble hash as it's drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I like to slip a little piece of
parchment paper in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can label it with the different screen
sizes and separate your pulls or your runs
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the size of the micron of the
screen and that helps you kind of organize
[SPEAKER_01]: it to find out which section maybe is the
best for you, works the best for your
[SPEAKER_01]: application of what you're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are obviously readily available,
found at your local pizza place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to pay a couple bucks to
grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can use them and they're easy to
get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, parchment paper, I like to
use the unbleached brown stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to work really well, haven't had any
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that we use is a
frisbee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to look into a
frisbee or a garbage clan lid depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of the material you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like this 20 gallon garbage
lid will help as well too if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: larger bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pancake spatula, so if you've ever seen
a pancake spatula before, we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: one right now, but basically it is a
spatula that has some holes in it and that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help push material around or flatten
down material when you're first putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course there's the Buckner
funnel and the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Buckner funnel you can go on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two other videos that talk about
and walk through that use of that
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you could afford one, freeze dryers
are also a wonderful option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's a multi-thousand dollar
investment and they also have a tendency
[SPEAKER_01]: to malfunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no real insurance programs on
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is kind of approach to what
hash making in a way of basic utility and
[SPEAKER_01]: tools that you may be able to find readily
available in any grocery store or any
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe not the most advanced
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably a ton of other videos
out there that can talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just gonna help you get
started and get going and get you
[SPEAKER_01]: processing your material at home so that
you can have really high quality hash that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know goes from farm to table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in our case farm to bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all we need to procure a set
of bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bags were donated to us by our
friends over at the Press Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a wonderful job with all different
types of accessories or bags and rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need anything please go ahead
and check out their website which is
[SPEAKER_01]: thepressclub.co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again that's thepressclub.co.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find these bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are called the Press Club wash bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in a variety of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in a variety of different
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy one bag, you can buy an
eight bag set, and you can buy I believe a
[SPEAKER_01]: three bag set as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each bag has its own micron size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts at 220 and it goes down to 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other increments in the middle
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those basically separate the size of
the trichome head that the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the plant grows it produces
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't all develop at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They develop at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you may have different sized
trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also are multiple different types
of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other trichomes have smaller heads that
will be removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have glandular trichomes, sessile
trichomes, and cystilis trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to avoid collecting cystilis
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want the glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mostly what we're trying to
procure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those bags are the essential part of
the component.
[SPEAKER_01]: To what you're looking for to make bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, our shooting the video,
the eight bag set on the Press Club site
[SPEAKER_01]: is $299.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a washing machine, let's say,
roughly costs $300 or $500.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you're looking at $299 for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a few hundred dollars investment
already into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that you can utilize
these tools to the best technology that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So preferred material to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could either do fresh frozen or you
could do dry material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh frozen is when you chop the plant
down at harvest and you immediately put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a freezer and you let that material
freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take it and you put it into
the machine and you start washing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really great way to capture
monoterpenes and other volatile organic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that would evaporate or at room
temperature and you may not have in a long
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people prefer this method because of
the quality of the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end quality of the end product also
has a different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually is a little lighter in color
and has a slightly different consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: With dried material that's cured,
that material will have a different flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also have a different color to the
end material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be slightly darker as well too
because the trichomes develop over time
[SPEAKER_01]: and they convert as well as the terpenes
will change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy Canole talks a lot about this and
I urge you to go out there and look into
[SPEAKER_01]: the videos that he has as well too because
he's spoken a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We very much appreciate your contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the hash community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have dry material you're going
to be looking at somewhere maybe between
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 15 percent return on your harvest
from the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is dependent on the quality of the
material you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the higher the quality of the material
the better the hash that's going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important to know that not every
single plant washes or runs through the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine and provides an end quality
product really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some do much better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote an article called Breeding to
Sieve on the Presco website on their blog
[SPEAKER_01]: and it really kind of gets more in depth
into what makes a good hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've found that some plants just really
wash better over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hold their quality over longer than
other plants and you know it just has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be something that you do over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you practice the better you're
going to find the nuances of this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: washes really well because of this
characteristic or this plant doesn't wash
[SPEAKER_01]: so well because it gets too sticky and the
resin sticks to the bag and you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of practices involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like anything you want to get good at
anything you got to practice it and do it
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same thing goes with making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more practice you have the more errors
you'll make the more you'll learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: those errors and the more successes you'll
have the more you learn from those
[SPEAKER_01]: successes you'll combine those two
informations and you'll be able to move on
[SPEAKER_01]: and really make the best quality product
you can for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there also is this other way to really
kind of know before because you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to maybe take your whole crop and say
let's wash it and you really get a poor
[SPEAKER_01]: return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do what's called the jar tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a simple method where you take a
mason jar fill it with ice and water take
[SPEAKER_01]: about 10 grams of flour at harvest put it
in there cap it give it a good shake and
[SPEAKER_01]: wait a couple seconds like shake it for 30
seconds shake your for a minute and then
[SPEAKER_01]: let the trichome heads fall to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the collection at the bottom
and again this is something that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do over and over and over again to
gauge what is good and what is average and
[SPEAKER_01]: what is below average.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the jar tech really helps you
analyze what the plant is able to do and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you when you have when you're looking
to procure a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the jar tech is a great option to
really kind of field test what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing before you invest your whole crop
into washing and dumping it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation where it just didn't return
because it just wasn't that type of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or it was it didn't come out the way you
wanted to do that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely check into that trichome
development is super important when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to process material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really going to want to look into
the get what's called the loop or a
[SPEAKER_01]: magnifying glass or something that can let
you look at the trichome head up close and
[SPEAKER_01]: really see it over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you track during the last few weeks of
your plants growth and you watch those
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads expand they'll get to a
point where they'll stop expanding and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty much when they're ready that
that's when the plant is pretty much ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to harvest is when that bulbous head is at
its fullest potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to go too far you want it
at it's like the top of the bell curve and
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple people talk about this Frenchy
Canole talked about this Swami talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: this and this is when you shake a plant
you can smell it or when you walk past it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very vibrant and smell and that's
because the trichome heads are ripe and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're falling off and they're opening
and releasing the terpenes that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and the other volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning these techniques when you're
harvesting learning these techniques when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're processing learning these
techniques when you go to wash all really
[SPEAKER_01]: help to add up to an end quality product
that really just gives you better material
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again practice practice practice research
practice and then you'll make your
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and you'll refine them and
you'll end up really really really
[SPEAKER_01]: enthused with what's what's happening at
the at the back end of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the a lot of the harvest timing
and a lot of the processing is also very
[SPEAKER_01]: individual to the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I prefer and what Shango likes and
what other people like is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might like something very lethargic and
so I like to let my plants go a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shango might like something that's very
uplifting and energetic so he might like
[SPEAKER_01]: to harvest his plants a little bit earlier
right in the middle at the high peak of
[SPEAKER_01]: moderation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning your plant is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And learning when you like to harvest your
plants is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are obviously conditions when
you have to chop and drop because of
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions, law enforcement,
whatever the reason being you may have to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust what you like to do to the
conditions around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general if you're repeating the
process every year and you're you're only
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a few plants at home under your
medical license or under the legal state
[SPEAKER_01]: laws then you can refine your process and
learn or you can acquire material from
[SPEAKER_01]: other people and process that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning your harvest times,
learning your plants, learning what plants
[SPEAKER_01]: wash really well all really help you
advance faster through the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storing that material is also important so
the more you touch the more you process
[SPEAKER_01]: the more it moves around the more it bangs
around it's gonna bang up the the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material and it may knock off the trichome
head it may crush break it open and open
[SPEAKER_01]: those volatiles organic compounds and the
cannabinoids onto the leaf surface so they
[SPEAKER_01]: won't be able to be acquired because when
we wash and we sieve we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect the trichome head as an individual
head and then collect a lot of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that there isn't any plant
material or any any other material that is
[SPEAKER_01]: left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we have all those things dialed in
and of course you know it takes time to
[SPEAKER_01]: practice this you're gonna have to go
through some harvests and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have to figure out what you're gonna you
know what works for you but once you get
[SPEAKER_01]: all that down it's really gonna become
more of like tying your shoes and a
[SPEAKER_01]: walk-through process of getting getting
that end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting out now with using the machine
we've already preloaded this machine
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just easier so what you would
normally do is you would come in you put a
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of ice at the bottom cover it up
this machine can handle up to a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of material you can use less
material just add less water and so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: only have let's say 300 grams of material
you're gonna use a little bit less than
[SPEAKER_01]: half the machine so here we don't have as
much material today we don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand grams that we're gonna be putting
into this machine so we're using less
[SPEAKER_01]: water you can see the the water
condensating on the outside here and not
[SPEAKER_01]: up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our water level stops here with the ice
and the water and but we start here with
[SPEAKER_01]: the ice at the bottom so you start with
the ice layer at the bottom that goes in
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you layer your cannabis on the
top of that and then you layer another ice
[SPEAKER_01]: layer on top of that as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you don't have to do it this way you
can just put the ice in there you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: the material in there and you can just add
water and and you can do it that way but
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of helps keep the the ice on the
top will help keep the material down and
[SPEAKER_01]: help rehydrate it while you're adding your
water so that it kind of moves through the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine a lot easier and flows and the
trichome heads break off with the water
[SPEAKER_01]: application as opposed to breaking off of
a mechanical operation from the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different types of ice cubes
that you can use of course you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: find what's readily available for you if
you have the space at home to make your
[SPEAKER_01]: own ice you and you have filter filters to
filter your water to do that it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: that's you know great you can save a lot
of money by making your own ice and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up and you can quality control
that aspect of the input.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the really important things to
remember when you start using the ice in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water is you want to make sure it's
filtered you don't want to use any water
[SPEAKER_01]: that is out of the tap that you haven't
tested because there's heavy metals there
[SPEAKER_01]: can be sulfur for instance on the island
here there's a lot of sulfur in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're unable to use that tap water
because it leaves a sulfur taste in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end product and we want to try to avoid
that so ideally using distilled water or
[SPEAKER_01]: RO filtered water or even just regular
filtered water I mean if you wanted to you
[SPEAKER_01]: could use a Brita filter but you're gonna
have to do a lot of Brita filtering into
[SPEAKER_01]: other containers to get the amount of
water that you need to do the wash but
[SPEAKER_01]: water quality is super important ice water
quality is really important so when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start making your ice the quality of the
water going into that is super important
[SPEAKER_01]: you always want to use distilled or RO
water if you can if you have access to it
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't get your well water tested
and see where it's at you know if it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: high in mineral content it's not high in
sulfur or anything that has a distinct
[SPEAKER_01]: smell or taste to it when you drink it
then go ahead and use it try and do a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple runs and see what the hash comes
out like if it comes out okay then then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's good if it doesn't then you
got to stick with procuring distilled
[SPEAKER_01]: water or RO water so now that you have the
ice in your water your ice is layered your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is layered your ice is layered on
top you can add your water that water is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fill all the way up to the top of
the ice there and you're gonna let that
[SPEAKER_01]: material sit in this for probably anywhere
between 15 to 30 minutes again that's
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the the material how dry it
is going in if it's fresh frozen obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't need to sit in the water for 30
minutes because it's already full of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's frozen and cold so you can avoid
that but for the most times you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: want to let the plant sit and and soak in
the machine for roughly about 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: some people like to freeze the material
ahead of time that's awesome if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer space to do that it's not
imperative it does help the trichome heads
[SPEAKER_01]: break off and it makes the process of
rehydrating and keeping it cold faster but
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have to be done you can just
use room temperature flour it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: fine now the runtime is also something
that is dependent on what you want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant material itself and how much
time you have you can run the plant the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine for up to 10 minutes and just
thrash everything around and try and get
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in one bout but we found that
if you run it in lesser increments you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pull higher quality material out of it at
a better rate so the most ripe trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to fall off around the first few
times that you're doing your first wash
[SPEAKER_01]: and the second wash so the first wash you
may only want to run for one minute or 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds or three minutes that's up to you
it's something that you need to decide
[SPEAKER_01]: what you want to do if you want the super
most ripe trichomes run it for a minute
[SPEAKER_01]: see what comes out running your second
wash for three minutes see what comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: and then adapt from there and go on and
try to make your your corrections that way
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking for just getting more
food grade quality where you're you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it and it's not super important
that it 's very clean and unadulterated
[SPEAKER_01]: with plant material then go ahead and just
run a longer wash on your first few runs
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to get as much material out of it
as you can again practice right find what
[SPEAKER_01]: works for you in the situation that you're
doing for the thing that you want to do so
[SPEAKER_01]: once you've acquired your bags to wash
with you're gonna have your garbage can
[SPEAKER_01]: here and you're gonna need to layer them
into the can you're gonna start with the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest bag the number 45 then you're gonna
go up to your 73 then your 90 then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go to your 120 160 190 220 again
however many bags you buy is dependent on
[SPEAKER_01]: how much you can afford and what you want
to run and then you'll also find out which
[SPEAKER_01]: bags you want to use over time different
bags will pull different trichome heads
[SPEAKER_01]: and different plants produce different
size trichome heads so again it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: practice kind of thing and you'll have to
go through a bunch of different material
[SPEAKER_01]: to find out but once you get your bags
you're gonna take them like I said put the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest number at the bottom put that bag
in first put it around you'll have these
[SPEAKER_01]: little tie things to come in here and
cinch it in and that will help keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: taut to the the can when you run the water
so it doesn't pull the bag into the the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole can that would not be an ideal
situation so here we would take this put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in also before you put your bags in
here you're gonna want to pre-wash them go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and just take a hose you can use
regular water for this not a huge deal but
[SPEAKER_01]: just go ahead wash them out you may want
to kind of fold them up a little bit put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in some water wash them sometimes
from manufacturing they come with a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: loose threads so you may get some fibers
that come off you know it's not a big deal
[SPEAKER_01]: get in there wash them get a little
pre-wash go ahead let them dry out and
[SPEAKER_01]: then go ahead and put them in stacked with
45 at the bottom some folks will use the
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 bag I'm not a big fan of the 25 bag
personally it's some it's just it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it the material is not there it
doesn't it's not my personal opinion it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not worth it but if you want to go ahead
and use that low of a bag that's cool use
[SPEAKER_01]: it see what it how it works for you but
yeah 25 45 73 so they all come in
[SPEAKER_01]: different companies make different size
bag numbers one of the things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: also want to remember too when you buy
your bags is to match the diameter of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag to the opening of the container that
you're using so this container is a 20
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon container because these are
specific 20 gallon bags that the Presco
[SPEAKER_01]: makes Presco also makes them in five
gallons 10 gallons you got the 20s here
[SPEAKER_01]: and they go up to 30s as well to 33s other
companies like the bubble bags they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have their biggest bag I think is a
20 33 bag which works in a 33 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: container and for both 20 and 33 gallons
size but the press club has made more
[SPEAKER_01]: specific bags for different applications
so again check your bag size with the
[SPEAKER_01]: website that you order it from and check
the size of the container that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using and make sure they match not super
inconvenient to have to go out and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: another one but you know it's next 25
bucks that you don't have to spend so once
[SPEAKER_01]: you get your bags here you're gonna layer
them in I don't usually bring them under
[SPEAKER_01]: the handle here because it stretches them
out you really don't want to stretch or
[SPEAKER_01]: pull on the bags really hard because it'll
kind of move the they're all in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: mesh form right so you have squares tiny
little squares throughout the bag which is
[SPEAKER_01]: what is used in the sieving process so if
you tighten and loosen it changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter of the the hole in the bag and so
you want to kind of keep it loose and but
[SPEAKER_01]: you also don't want it to fall in when the
water comes out of the machine and and
[SPEAKER_01]: fills the bag so again there's a practice
curve there that you need to learn and
[SPEAKER_01]: once you get that curve down it becomes
substantially easier so that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: end here that we have for the putting the
bags in and we'll get back to making a run
[SPEAKER_01]: on the machine here all right we're back
and just gonna run over a few things here
[SPEAKER_01]: before we come to the end I didn't mention
sprayers before and sprayers are important
[SPEAKER_01]: part of kind of collecting the hash after
you pull the bag you definitely want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a good sprayer you can use a hand
sprayer that you would you know like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hand pump sprayer that would you would
maybe use to use it for cleaning agents or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that that does work it's
it's you know if you have arthritis it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the option you want to use if you
struggle with repetitive motion it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the option you want to use but again if
you if it's the only thing you can find in
[SPEAKER_01]: your area for the time you can totally do
that even if you can't find a sprayer you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use a one gallon jug put your couple
fingers over the hole and kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: pour and let it run around and push all
the material down that's going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: most basic way to do it you can step up to
like a pesticide sprayer so you could go
[SPEAKER_01]: to Home Depot or you go to Lowe's or any
hardware store and look for like a 10
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pesticide sprayer excuse me a 10
gallon pesticide sprayer again you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to contaminate it with
pesticide you're not going to want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: it for Korean natural farming inputs or
JDAM or anything else label it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: words hash making only put a label maker
sticker on it draw a star on it whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is you got to do but basically only use
that for hash making so that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated with any other inputs or
anything like that that hand pump sprayer
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get from Home Depot it's like
a 10 gallon hand pump sprayer comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: the wand that's a good option to use for
home it's cheap it's probably about 25 30
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks at most and it's going to do a
decent job at getting the trichomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are stuck to the side of the walls of the
bag down to the bottom a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the who are doing commercial production
like to use sump pumps in a an exterior 30
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon garbage can that is then run
through a hose and you just end up using
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these and then you spray down into
the container and that really pushes down
[SPEAKER_01]: we unfortunately are unable to use this at
the location we're at today because the
[SPEAKER_01]: water is high in sulfur coming out of the
tap so it would contaminate our hash and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of give it that sulfurated flavor so
we try to avoid that and we just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to set up to run the pump here at
this time so again this is a video
[SPEAKER_01]: designed specifically for entry level
people or those people who are in areas
[SPEAKER_01]: where you just don't have resources to the
things that would make the perfect setup
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you just got to do what you got
to do to get through to figure it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how it is so make sure you have a
really good sprayer that's super important
[SPEAKER_01]: to help collect all the trichomes it
really will just get you that maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and return from everything and
you'll be able to be more satisfied with
[SPEAKER_01]: your end results on that for just a very
low input cost purchase so yeah so once
[SPEAKER_01]: you pull the bags out you're going to
scrape them you're going to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: everything put it on the parchment paper
put it on a drying screen or put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza box or on a piece of cardboard
anything that's going to kind of let the
[SPEAKER_01]: water move out of it and and go away from
the hash so that it can dry quickly so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't particularly want to heat the hash
that's going to really cause some
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation you're going to lose some
terpenes it may convert some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids if you're heating it over
time but yeah so basically look into when
[SPEAKER_01]: you pull out everything get it onto the
parchment paper get it on the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: screen get it in front of a fan or put it
into the bookner funnel and use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: help remove the water out of it or you can
go ahead if you do have the funds to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of a vacuum or a freeze dryer the
freeze dryer will be the best option to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you remove the water as fast as
possible and get you the highest quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product at the end so now that you've got
the process set up you're either going to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose your air dry your bookner funnel
air dry which is another air drying
[SPEAKER_01]: technique or the freeze dryer you're going
to go into storage once your hash is dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've determined that it's ready to
store you're going to want to either put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a jar of some sort a glass jar
with a lid that can see and or put it into
[SPEAKER_01]: some cellophane tie it up into a little
ball and tighten it basically you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep air and moisture out and some folks
will even put in some of those moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer packs those will go in there they
work sometimes if you want to use those as
[SPEAKER_01]: well I think they impart a personally I
think they impart a flavor onto the the
[SPEAKER_01]: material when you use them I avoid them
but that doesn't mean that other people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like to use them and they're not
successful with them they are in their
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes and that's totally cool alright
[SPEAKER_01]: so some final thoughts here on the end of
our day making hash I just want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that everybody knows that this
process is kind of a gold in gold out
[SPEAKER_01]: process and that means using really high
quality material will yield you really
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality hash as long as you do a good
job sieving it so if you start with lower
[SPEAKER_01]: quality material you're going to
definitely end up with a lower quality end
[SPEAKER_01]: product but that's the whole goal is get
better at growing or get better at
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing better material and then you will
also probably get better at sieving hash
[SPEAKER_01]: over time because it will be easier your
results will be better and you'll feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better about what you're actually doing so
that's really important and be patient
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you're doing it is a long
monotonous process that you have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitive over and over again if you're
only growing once a year then maybe it is
[SPEAKER_01]: only once a year outdoor material that
you're using you're only gonna be maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: making hash once or twice a year then so
if not if you're growing indoors you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have more practice or if you have
the ability to grow auto flowers outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can use those to practice with
too that will just help refine your
[SPEAKER_01]: technique to get better for the full terms
or the indoor or whatever it is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: deciding to do with your your production
method also if you're looking for more
[SPEAKER_01]: information about how to do this because
this is a very casual video and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting you the basics of what's
going on go on to social media sites like
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram or Facebook take a look at
people out there there's a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously Frenchy Canole rest in peace
Frenchy he was one of the best hash makers
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world and he you know has a ton of
information on his Instagram page his wife
[SPEAKER_01]: met Madame Canole and his apprentice
cherry blossom Bell are also putting on
[SPEAKER_01]: classes all over the United States they
were just did a class in California and
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they're a great resource as well
too to pass on the tradition of hashish
[SPEAKER_01]: making and temple ball production there's
also other people like Jendo she's an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing hash maker she's up in the
northeast and she is will answer your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and help you get on the right
pathway to making better hash resin ranch
[SPEAKER_01]: in California is another great person to
take a look at there's a variety people
[SPEAKER_01]: out there but also be respectful because
Jendo and resin ranch will just likely
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly tell you to fuck off if you are
being very impolite or pushy remember
[SPEAKER_01]: these people have thousands of people
following them and they can't get to every
[SPEAKER_01]: single question every day but if you're
patient and you wait or if you go through
[SPEAKER_01]: their scrolls and watch go through their
posts and you go through their timelines
[SPEAKER_01]: you can find the bits and pieces of
information that they they give out for
[SPEAKER_01]: free and and you'll be able to be more
successful faster in your production and
[SPEAKER_01]: your hash making so be respectful be
patient and have a good time and as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: making all the hash because that's the
real end goal is to enjoy what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing make a great hash product and and
then enjoy that when you're when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: finished with it so if you have any other
questions throw them down in the the
[SPEAKER_01]: comment section there I'll do my best to
jump on and answer them when I can I
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate you hanging out with us here
today with this and video get help you get
[SPEAKER_01]: off the ground and get started my name is
Tyler Marquardt and hope to see you spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: some hash with you sometime soon cheers
you
