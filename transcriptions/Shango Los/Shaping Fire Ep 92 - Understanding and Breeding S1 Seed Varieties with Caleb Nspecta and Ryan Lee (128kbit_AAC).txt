[SPEAKER_01]: People grow cannabis for all sorts of
reasons and in all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most licensed commercial outfits are
looking for consistency, where every seed
[SPEAKER_01]: expresses itself in the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many home growers are looking for that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, most cannabis breeders and many
home growers pop cannabis seeds to find
[SPEAKER_01]: variety, atypical plant morphology,
and rare expressions of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our complex cannabis scene,
some are trying to syphiline down to one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant type, while other folks are trying
to open up the wild cannabis genome to
[SPEAKER_01]: find the outer edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are fabulous and important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode sits in the middle of
these two worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: S1 seed types are about catching the
lightning in the bottle for one popular
[SPEAKER_01]: plant variety, but also, when looking at
the snapshot of a gene pool, being excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about everything that is possible in that
one small gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the unexpected stuff.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guests today are Caleb Inspector and
Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan Lee is a professional cannabis
researcher and plant breeder specializing
[SPEAKER_01]: in cultivar design and the inheritance of
the therapeutic compounds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: His background training is in neuroscience
and studying the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: with a strong focus on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: His post-grad work at the University of
British Columbia was in plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan is founder of Chimera Genetic
Resource Management and the Chimavar
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera is essentially a seed bank and a
cannabis germplasm firm operating in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe for nearly 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimavar Corporation is based in Canada
and focuses on breeding specialty cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, laboratory analytics,
cultivation consulting, cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, licensing and importation for
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score seeds from his breeding
projects via Instagram at Breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan recently appeared on Shaping Fire
Episode 64 about feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: female-only breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 74 about tissue culture and
micropropagation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb Inspector is founder and breeder at
CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb and his family have lived in
Humboldt County for over a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family has cultivated exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensemia in Humboldt, Mendocino and
Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb's seeds are available at HumboldtCSI
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb also appears on Shaping Fire Episode
49 about feminized cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're gonna talk about S1 seeds,
what they are, their advantages and
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges and a bit on how to make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, fellas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start by digging into what an S1 is
to get us all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with you, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you give us an explanation from
the scientific perspective of what an S1
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So an S1 is really a designation or a
label that we give to a generation of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: S1 seeds come from the mating of one
particular plant to itself and the
[SPEAKER_04]: resulting generation of seeds is what we
called S1 or self one generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really what we mean when we say
S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're referring to a population that is
created through mating one particular
[SPEAKER_04]: plant to itself with no outside genetic
influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we say mating it to itself,
we're talking about like female only
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding where we're going to cause male
flowers on that same plant and so it is
[SPEAKER_01]: self pollinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we create a self fertilization
event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are probably gonna want to
go back and listen to the other episode
[SPEAKER_04]: that we did on S1s to kind of get a bit of
a basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you'll take two cuttings.
[SPEAKER_04]: of the same plant and one plant will be
treated with a hormone blocker to induce
[SPEAKER_04]: male flowers on an otherwise female plant
and so we actually have two individual
[SPEAKER_04]: specimens but genetically they're the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them we treat with a hormone recipe
that induces the formation of male flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: on that particular female genetic plant
and those male flowers are able to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen and then we use the pollen from
that plant to transfer to the female
[SPEAKER_04]: version of that same clone, the untreated
version, the plant that we didn't put any
[SPEAKER_04]: hormones on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will naturally develop female flowers
and when we bring the pollen from the male
[SPEAKER_04]: version of that plant or the male,
the stamina version I guess we should call
[SPEAKER_04]: it of that plant and we fertilize the
pistolet version, we end up with a
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of seed that is created only
from the genetic type of that one
[SPEAKER_04]: individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will talk more about the attributes
of these S1 seeds in a moment but Caleb,
[SPEAKER_01]: another way to focus on what is an S1
other than just talking about it from a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic perspective is to focus on why we
bother to make them and you're the most
[SPEAKER_01]: prolific maker of S1s that I'm aware of in
the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you make S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are these attractive to you to produce
and share with the community?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think first is preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult keeping clones alive for
years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had clones for certain individuals
for over 20 years but it's not fun taking
[SPEAKER_02]: care of a huge library of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially for that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so preservation is always the main
target.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then basically breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally like to breed with S1
selections and then move on to S2s,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can really narrow down certain
traits by utilizing the S1 seeds to make
[SPEAKER_02]: new, more stable hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the two main reasons that
I like to create them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being one of the few folks who are putting
S1s, especially S1s often into the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that you're used to
answering the question like, what's an S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most seed buyers are comfortable
with seeing F1, F2, F3, even if they might
[SPEAKER_01]: not be F3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are at least aware of that
notation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But S1s is still pretty unfamiliar to most
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are at a table or when you are
explaining it to somebody, do you find
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are scared or skittish of it
just because it's got an atypical
[SPEAKER_01]: notation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you find that people are pretty easy
to just pick up S1s because they like the
[SPEAKER_01]: description of the cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think this is a topic we'll be
getting to here shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, of course, think an S1 is
more or less the same as the plant it's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll touch on that, I'm sure,
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people tend to want those S1s over
hybrids because they're looking for a pure
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of the cut they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not always the case of what
they're going to get from S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like the people who come to
you and they're holding these seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they pretty much fall into two categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who know what S1s are are excited
to get them because they're special and
[SPEAKER_01]: they put breeding power in their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people who don't know what S1s
are that may be a little more unsure
[SPEAKER_01]: because they want seeds that are going to
work for them and they only know what F1s
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a certain amount of,
I don't know, constant press the air
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces or you need to provide them once
you figure out what kind of a cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of the people who come to me
already have a fairly decent idea of what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking for, what they're trying
to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all, but definitely most it seems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a, if I could just jump in
here, I think we have a real interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: thing in the cannabis seed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you go and buy flower seeds
or vegetable seeds, you can expect that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're buying the seeds and when you grow
them, they're all going to look the same
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're all going to look like the
plant on the front of the package.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that just doesn't happen in cannabis,
partly because of the history of
[SPEAKER_04]: hybridization that we've really gone
through in the past 30, 40 years with this
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, but also partly because of the
plant's natural native mating cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I get people to kind of
understand, I try to get people to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that cannabis is very,
the mating system of cannabis is very much
[SPEAKER_04]: like the mating system of humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you look at any given human
family, you have a male that has sexual
[SPEAKER_04]: relations with a female and that creates a
generation of offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you look around the world and we
look at this practice all over the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were pretty sure you know, we can
understand pretty conclusively that the
[SPEAKER_04]: family that's created from the mom and the
dad might look like the mom and the dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're not reproductions of either
the mom or the dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we compare that practice to
the way that we, you know, breed plants
[SPEAKER_04]: for agriculture, the expectation is when
you cross two plants together,
[SPEAKER_04]: that all of the plants will come up
looking the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that there's a lot of
confusion in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know there's a lot of confusion in
this seed market and there's a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage of people that even if they
understand that an S1 is the product of
[SPEAKER_04]: one clone self-fertilizing or
self-fertilizing and producing seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: people believe that by crossing the same
clone to itself, that all of the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to end up looking like that same
plant, that same clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a total fallacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're buying, you know,
legend OG seeds from Caleb and you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that all the plants are going to end up
looking and smelling like the legend OG,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're really mistaken.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we talk about, when Caleb
talks about preservation, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important to clarify that when you breed,
when you, when you create an S1 seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes, the entire generation as a collection
has all of the traits within that
[SPEAKER_04]: generation that were present in the parent
plant, but the individual plants in that
[SPEAKER_04]: population may or may not have that trait,
those traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just a simple reality of the
way that meiosis and recombination works.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not always going to get all the
traits when we have, we have traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what's called a segregating
generation and people can look that up,
[SPEAKER_04]: but a segregating generation is
essentially a generation of plant breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: where traits recombine with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the expectation of a lot of
people is that when they see seeds that
[SPEAKER_04]: come from a plant that looked like a
legend, sorry, legend OG, that all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants will be clones of that legend OG
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're buying say, I don't know
the package size that Caleb sells his S1s
[SPEAKER_04]: in, but if you're buying, you know,
seeds of say five S1 seeds and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: expecting to see a plant that looks like
the parent, in all ways, you're probably
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be, you're probably not going to
find what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think I'll leave it there and
we can expand on that as we go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk more about those
attributes of S1 seeds in just a moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to do it now, but I'm not going
to take that bait because I want to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you said at the beginning of
this where you were comparing S1 seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: the expectations of growers to the,
you know, to the commercial ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious, you know, there are so
many expectations and even vocabulary that
[SPEAKER_01]: we use in the cannabis scene that seems
absurd to the more formalized and
[SPEAKER_01]: established agriculture market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the rest of the ag market use S1
seeds or are those so R&D that those are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a middle step before you get
to the seeds that you release to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public in the regular ag market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like are we people in cannabis,
some of the only folks that are messing
[SPEAKER_01]: around with S1 seeds at the retail level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting, it's an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I not knowing enough of the other,
the way that other plants operate or the
[SPEAKER_04]: markets for other plant plants operate,
I can't really answer conclusively.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you for sure, like in the
agricultural market, if you're buying like
[SPEAKER_04]: tomato seed or like rye or wheat,
or like some type of grain that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: planting by the thousand acres,
they're not producing them by self seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that case, the self seed is more of a
step, um, like a breeding step that
[SPEAKER_04]: probably wouldn't be released
commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, kind of touching upon what
we had just said about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: selling five packs or 10 packs,
so S1 seed, I really see Caleb doing
[SPEAKER_04]: something as a service to the,
to the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't consider S1 seeds or
the production of S1 seeds as like a real
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding project that, that we would,
that like a plant breeder would
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily take a huge amount of pride
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in a lot of cases, what we're doing
is getting a plant from the marketplace or
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant that the community has decided is
valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, that happens as these,
the elite clones call them raised,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they kind of, they're kind of like
the cream of the crop, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody has say 10 really great
plants, but the best ones get shared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they get shared and shared
again, the ones that remain and continue
[SPEAKER_04]: to be shared are really the best of the
best, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if Caleb acquires one of those
plants and he decides to make S1 seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's really not doing a lot of actual
breeding work, but he's providing a
[SPEAKER_04]: service to the community in allowing the
reproduction and like he said,
[SPEAKER_04]: the preservation of that plant in a seed
form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I would argue, you know, at,
again, like at five seeds in a pack,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not really doing a huge service to
the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think that like, if,
if someone is really serious about a seed
[SPEAKER_04]: line and they truly want to, like say I
want to, say I don't have legend seed in
[SPEAKER_04]: my, in my stable and I want to buy legend
OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Caleb or some other self that he's
created that I don't have in my stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, when I grow self seeds,
I really don't look at like less than 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I said, the, the traits that
we see in the parents in some plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: they disappear and kind of like an either
or fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and you might have a valuable trait
in one of the offspring, but it might be
[SPEAKER_04]: missing another valuable trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, let's talk again,
legend OG, legend OG has got her,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a hybrid of two plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a relatively interesting scent
profile on one side of the parentage and
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that scent is dominant, but the
other side of the parentage contributed
[SPEAKER_04]: like a not very desirable smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you, when you shuffle those genes
and you grow the next generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: 75% of them are going to have the trait
that you want that, that delicious smell,
[SPEAKER_04]: but 25% of the plants are not going to
have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we've only looked at one
trait, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we factor in like,
say let's say that there's a yield
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristic or a powdery mildew
resistance characteristic that is
[SPEAKER_04]: recessive and it only occurs in 25% of the
plants when, when it's bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you have to multiply that 25%
probability by the 75% of the plants that
[SPEAKER_04]: have the smell profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that out of like,
you know, those four plants that we
[SPEAKER_04]: already started with, we're already down
to like one potential plant out of four.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to have the two traits that
we're really looking at, that we're really
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in following or breeding for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like part of the S1 growing process
is really, like you said, Shango,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, this is part of the work that's done
behind the scenes and really doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: usually make it to the market in other
crop species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's really like, we're kind of
working out the traits and trying to get
[SPEAKER_04]: them all alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way that when we release them to the
public, the public gets exactly what they
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, my argument is that
Caleb's really doing a service to the
[SPEAKER_04]: community by taking some of these held,
tightly held plants, making, segregating
[SPEAKER_04]: generations of the genetics in those
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, making self seeds from
those plants and then sharing those far
[SPEAKER_04]: and wide, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that kind of democratizes the
breeding process and opens up I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of the, some of the elite germplasm
that exists in the species and it
[SPEAKER_04]: distributes it around the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's probably quite a
different mentality that happens in other
[SPEAKER_04]: crop species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I look at selling self seeds
as both as the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're kind of selling seeds that are like
a relatively high dollar value,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it didn't have a ton of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That went into it, but on the flip side,
you're really offering something to the
[SPEAKER_04]: community that they couldn't get
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that it's fair that if
somebody really wanted to work a seed line
[SPEAKER_04]: and say, Caleb is selling 10 seeds for a
hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you want to grow 50 seeds,
I would come and buy five packs of those
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and grow them all together,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then, like we were talking about
that preservation step that exists within
[SPEAKER_04]: the entire S1 population, you have like a
relatively decent size snapshot of that
[SPEAKER_04]: variation within 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better if you have a hundred seeds,
but 50 is certainly much, much better than
[SPEAKER_04]: five seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit rambly, but I don't know
if that- No, not rambly at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually really like what you said
about the democratization of these
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasms, these genetics, because it is
true, like nobody can argue that Caleb has
[SPEAKER_01]: got plants that have been desired by
breeders for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably misquote you Caleb,
so I'm sorry in advance, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've heard you talk on the last
time you were on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you were talking about the old
family purple kush that has been in your
[SPEAKER_01]: family for, I think we could actually
literally say generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's like this old particular
purple kush cut that has these attributes
[SPEAKER_01]: that people have not only loved as far as
a flower that people wanted to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also it had attributes that people
wanted to use as solid breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost nobody has set up a situation
where you have where you're able to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: such a library and there are all sorts of
new breeders and hell, even old breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: that just don't have really awesome access
to genetics who are all like, I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, I want to breed the best thing that
I can breed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to get my hands on 25,
30 year old or longer purple kush so that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can breed it to the cool thing that I've
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're taking the care to actually
kind of like an archivist to make it into
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, capture the variety of the genetics
and then put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that sets up for this question for
you, Caleb, is that what Ryan suggested
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing a lot more archiving
than breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of thought in my head,
I'm like, I bet you there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: selection in there that you're not
actually trying to add anything to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe you're selecting which plants to
run with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to kind of put this together
in one messy question and just drop it on
[SPEAKER_01]: your lap, dude, which is how do you see
the work that you're doing in S1s like
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of it is you found this
particular cut in the scene and you
[SPEAKER_01]: verified it and you want to capture its
potential for a lot of people and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore you make the S1s or are you
actually, I'll just say forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is true or not,
but it's just what I'm going to use for
[SPEAKER_01]: the example where maybe you found a few
forbidden fruits that you liked and then
[SPEAKER_01]: backcross them into each other to kind of
make a CSI humble version of forbidden
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit and then you're making that an S1
because in your mind it is a perfected
[SPEAKER_01]: forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, my friend, is my messy question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, I definitely 100% agree
with Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always looked at making S1s as far as
the retail level goes as just a service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pretend I'm any kind of breeder on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just providing a service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, realistically, I make the S1s for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make them, one, to preserve,
make sure you have something in the fridge
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer for a later date, but also the S1s
to me are a first step in any type of
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized breeding project program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding or making S1s isn't, like Ryan
said, it's not breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just making that first step and what
I like to do past S1s is, like he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to grow out at least 100 of them if
I can and select my favorites out of there
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I can go a bunch of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make pure S2s where I select one cut
and pollinate it with itself or I can take
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple few different sister cuts and
cross them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can always back cross to the mom with
some of those S1s, but in my experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that really produces what
I'm genuinely looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that ties into that forbidden fruit
example you made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could make S1s a forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could grow out 100 of them, pick my
favorites, breed them together this way,
[SPEAKER_02]: that way, the other, and make something
that's no longer just the forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my bread selected, my version of
forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: S1s are so variable that you can give it
to a dozen different breeders and each one
[SPEAKER_02]: will end up with a different thing at the
finish line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that touched entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like you to take it a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a little guess that this is of
the same variety, but would you tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: story of Lemon Tree Lemon Party?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, so I originally got a lemon
tree cut and I grew it out and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't think this is lemon
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a bit of research on it and I
found out that it had zero the attributes
[SPEAKER_02]: of, well, not zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say zero because it had that
extremely pungent lemon tree type smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the plant didn't grow anything like
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of tracked down what that
cut was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also tracked down the original
lemon tree cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I acquired the lemon tree cut and
grew it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's a completely different
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had this original, the first lemon
tree cut I had gotten, but you could you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to call it lemon tree because
it's not the lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we kind of changed its name
to Lemon Party, you know, because on its
[SPEAKER_02]: own, it's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always kind of looked at it as a
hybrid of lemon tree, but it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: either an S1 of lemon tree or a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not at all the story that I
thought it was going to be, but I'm glad I
[SPEAKER_01]: asked you anyway, because it was still a
good story, but then I thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be an S1 story, but it is more
like receiving a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the one you thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is probably a good place to
ask you, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that you are hardcore
into searching out the actual cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, making sure that you've got a
verified lineage accurate cut is an
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate priority to you and which makes
sense since you are a bit of an archivist
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to preserve these particular
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that you run into times like
you just described where you really want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be the right cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person told you it was the right cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evidence is looking like it very well
could be the right cut, but then when you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it, it ain't the right cut and like
kind of like how do you struggle with
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: To like know if you want to go forward
with this being the cut or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I always try to get, you know,
cuts as close to the original source as I
[SPEAKER_02]: can, if not just the original source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if you can't, then yeah,
it gets a little tricky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was just going to say just with,
you know, like with the lemon party,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the cut, you know, stands alone and on
its own merits, then definitely worth
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it doesn't and it doesn't,
well, it doesn't line up with what the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: is or should be that you were looking for,
those kind of need to just get filtered
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you, when you go to original
sources for these cuts, do you find that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, you've been doing this
long enough, you're OG enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: people know you enough where the sources
of the cut, like the original breeder or
[SPEAKER_01]: finder, depending on the nature of the
cut, that they're all like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, like I'm happy to provide it to you
so you know it's the actual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you find that like people really
want to hold that more often than not,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're happy that people are selling
cuts that aren't actually the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because it creates artificial scarcity for
their original cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just have so much kick ass stuff
to trade that you always have something
[SPEAKER_01]: they want and people always give up the
cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could say all the above
because no two, no two scenarios are the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much every different scenario
you described, yeah, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that can fall into each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of the scarcity one
where people start trading one cut even
[SPEAKER_02]: though it's not the right cut or the
original cut as the same type of name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a perfect, well not a perfect
example, but an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was originally a wedding cake
around the Bay Area and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it circulated for a couple few years,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Jungle Boys ran some of,
you know, Just Blazen's hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the Cushman or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they named their keeper cut wedding
cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this cut of wedding cake that had
circulated the Bay Area and beyond,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all of a sudden it's not the
popular wedding cake because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the wedding cake from the Jungle Boys and
Jade Beasley, you know, got circulated en
[SPEAKER_02]: masse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now all of a sudden that's the most
popular wedding cake and it's not even the
[SPEAKER_02]: original wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do in that kind of scenario
where you've had a wedding cake for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 10 or 12 years and yet there's a
brand new wedding cake that's not even the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cake, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really strange in that case,
the influence of the marketing aspect on
[SPEAKER_01]: how the lineage will be taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do they say?
[SPEAKER_01]: The winners write the history,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, big time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ryan, I want to, talk about the
inherent weaknesses that there may be in
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s right before we go to break here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come back for set two,
we're gonna go more in depth into the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic variety that's held within a group
of S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am more focused on, like, as a breeder
or as a grower, are there any inherent
[SPEAKER_01]: weaknesses to S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes them less than desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could just be that the answer is
no, because we'll talk more about intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and things like that in the second
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are there any, you know, since this
first set is kind of like getting people
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with S1s, are there any
immediately red flags to S1s that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would flag as a geneticist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because mostly what we've said so far are
that S1s are pretty kick ass and they meet
[SPEAKER_01]: a very particular need of breeders and
then, you know, nerdy people like me that
[SPEAKER_01]: just like to see different expressions of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are uniquely aware of what's under
the hood of an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything we want to say
that is dangerous about an S1,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to pull it out right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, another interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that there, I mean,
I don't think that we can look at all S1
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and say these seeds are going to
have this set of problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really have to take it on a case by
case basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, S1, making S1s, sorry, crossing a
plant to itself is the most severe form of
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding that we can do in any species.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, part of what keeps us safe as
humans is the fact that we have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: sex with a member of the opposite sex in
order to have offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that process, just because we've
evolved to have males and females,
[SPEAKER_04]: that process, it kind of prevents
inbreeding or at least it's a mating
[SPEAKER_04]: system that's designed and one of the
consequences is that it inhibits
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding because we're always breeding
to someone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the opposite, what we're doing
here is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're reducing it, we're removing any
genetic contribution from any other
[SPEAKER_04]: individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're subjecting that one,
the genetic variation that exists within
[SPEAKER_04]: that one individual, we're subjecting that
tiny little gene pool to a step of
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding that by definition removes 25%
of the variation in any subsequent sex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a very severe form of
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore, if the parent that we used
in that inbreeding step has any genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: weaknesses, those genetic weaknesses are
going to express themselves in the S1
[SPEAKER_04]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like doubling down on one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, you're putting all your
chips on this one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually couldn't have said it better
and I've never actually thought of it in
[SPEAKER_04]: those terms, but it really is genetic
doubling down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've identified, and in a sense,
Shango, what we're trying to do is double
[SPEAKER_04]: down on any given trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using a legend OG, the individual we were
talking about before, that plant's got a
[SPEAKER_04]: spike a little that's kind of,
it's much higher than your normal OG or
[SPEAKER_04]: gassy type plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that gives it like a little bit of
an interesting kick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by selfing it, or by selfing that
individual and removing any genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: combination or contribution from any other
plant, we're hoping that in the next
[SPEAKER_04]: generation, we might find an individual
that has even higher levels of little law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what you're doing with
an S1 is like, when you have a rare trait,
[SPEAKER_04]: say it's like something visual that
everybody can understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say you get a plant with these bright
fuchsia pistols and no other plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: even in the immediate family, like none of
the brothers or none of the sisters of
[SPEAKER_04]: that family have these same pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to, if you like that
trait and you say, hey, I want all of my
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in the next generation to have pink
pistols, the question becomes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which plant do I hybridize the pink pistol
plant with in order for all the plants in
[SPEAKER_04]: the next generation to produce pink
pistols, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may sound kind of trite,
but the obvious answer is you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: breed it with a plant that also has pink
pistols, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if there are no other pink pistol
plants within that population,
[SPEAKER_04]: the most likely plant to contribute that
same genetic trait is that very plant
[SPEAKER_04]: itself, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're hoping is that by mating
the plant itself to itself, that all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants in the next generation are
gonna have that trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they don't all have that trait,
at least we can start making some
[SPEAKER_04]: conclusions or hypotheses about how that
trait is inherited based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: representation of that trait in the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of got away from inherent
weaknesses, but I think it's just to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that the weaknesses that exist
in a potential S1 seed lot are really a
[SPEAKER_04]: result of the technique, the breeding
technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not something that we can say
all S1 seeds are gonna have these specific
[SPEAKER_04]: set of problems because the specific set
of problems that might arise are a result
[SPEAKER_04]: of what is hidden in the genetic
background of the plants that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: mating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me of leveraged
investing, whether it be stocks or
[SPEAKER_01]: bitcoins or whatever, where when things go
good, because you're leveraged,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when things go bad, because you're
leveraged, they go really, really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: because there is an exponential doubling
down on whatever that thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing in this case where if the
breeder has done their work and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using a good cut to begin with,
it can become a great cut because you are
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that plant to itself and doubling
down on those attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a messy lineage and it doesn't
go well, well, it's just gonna be a
[SPEAKER_01]: fricking wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not necessarily gonna be a
fricking wreck, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The population as a whole might be a
fricking wreck, but we might find those
[SPEAKER_04]: one or two or three individuals that
are... In plant breeding, it's all about
[SPEAKER_04]: raising the mean level of performance of
the plant on any set of traits over
[SPEAKER_04]: generations, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we've got a plant that say,
let's call it an eight and a half on a
[SPEAKER_04]: scale of 10, and we breed it and we make
S1s of it, and then we grow 100 of the
[SPEAKER_04]: next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If 95% of those plants are a six or a
five, it doesn't really matter if five of
[SPEAKER_04]: those plants are a nine and a half or a
95, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we found some plants that are better
than the one that we started with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can kind of say, oh, well,
it was worth it going through all that
[SPEAKER_04]: garbage to have to find these ones that
were even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if we're selling that seed lot to
customers at a finished product,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're gonna be pissed off that only 5%
of the plants are suitable and are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually better performing than the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: that we got them from, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's kind of where we fall back
into that discussion about is selling S1
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds a finished product or is it a
service to the community, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I also didn't wanna create the impression
that that's what Caleb is doing is just
[SPEAKER_04]: pumping out S1s for money.
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes S1s as he's doing other steps in
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you follow his Instagram where he
shows his work, you can very clearly see
[SPEAKER_04]: that making pollen in the, you know,
making, let's go and I'll use like the OG
[SPEAKER_04]: example again, that Legend OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's making Legend OG S1 seeds,
he creates pollen from that Legend S1 or
[SPEAKER_04]: that treated Legends plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time as he fertilizes that
plant, the Legend, he also fertilizes a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of other things that are part of his
breeding projects, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And those seeds don't necessarily get sold
for seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in a way, the community is
renumerating Caleb for doing that work and
[SPEAKER_04]: creating the S1s and sharing them
throughout the global gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that function of making S1 seeds kind
of pays for a little bit of the R&D costs
[SPEAKER_04]: for him to move along his breeding
program, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because breeding is, you know,
it's not like if you're growing weed to
[SPEAKER_04]: make money, you're pumping out crop after
crop of clones, you're getting like a high
[SPEAKER_04]: dollar value for your crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're taking that same space and
dedicating to breeding, and like we just
[SPEAKER_04]: said in this example, you end up with 95%
of the plants are below par.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not really making the best use or
the best financial use of that like crop
[SPEAKER_04]: footprint, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be making more money if you were
growing clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because you're doing this work as a
breeder, you kind of in a sense,
[SPEAKER_04]: waste your space or you don't optimize
your space in the hopes that something
[SPEAKER_04]: better is going to come forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really do find, I feel that,
you know, making these S1s in the market
[SPEAKER_04]: that he has access to all these things,
all these popular plants is really like
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a service to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this description of,
you know, these seeds that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediary step that he uses as a
breeder on his way to his own crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's sharing his intermediate step.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me a lot of, I grew up in a
family of professional carpenters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would often have tools that did
really cool things in woodworking that a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend had made.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend designed and woodworked a tool
for woodworking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then would like sell it to like
friends at the bar or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this pool of people around that
particular woodworker would have this tool
[SPEAKER_01]: that the craftsman made to make their
craft better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of ways that feels like what
Caleb's S1s are is like, hey, here's this
[SPEAKER_01]: tool I made to make my crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to hoard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to keep it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to offer this tool into
the community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking us into commercial, Caleb,
we're talking about you right in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this ring true to you at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you picking up what we're putting down
or are your motivations actually like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different and we're actually
missing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, you're pretty accurate on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I pretty much put everything I
make right back in to breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, a lot of the stuff I do makes
zero dollars and costs a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it definitely rings true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guests today are Caleb and Specta and Ryan
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please support them and let them know
you heard about them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to

[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_01]: other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014 and as the
[SPEAKER_01]: market has diversified into psilocybin and
other plant medicines, Green Light has
[SPEAKER_01]: been right there evolving with their
diverse clients to provide legal expertise
[SPEAKER_01]: with a high level of legal acumen,
creative strategy and precision that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_01]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a loss suit or because you
[SPEAKER_01]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner or simply because you wanna stay
[SPEAKER_01]: legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their work
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_01]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.

[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_01]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each phenom in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics
to my friends and listeners who grew up
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow automatic flowering cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome Automatics became a trusted and
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years as Mandalorian Genetics and recently
changed their name to Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that has changed is the
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score Gnome Automatics seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: the website too.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand-built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guests
today are Ryan Lee and Caleb Inspecta.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this second set is all about
the attributes of these S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We touched on it a bit during set one,
but, you know, the goal is to dig into it
[SPEAKER_01]: much more now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the break, you know,
Ryan and I were talking about whether or
[SPEAKER_01]: not he makes S1s because I was under the
assumption that he didn't, but he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh no, I make S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we're actually going
to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Ryan, you know, I've never seen any of
your S1s, but now that we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: during the first set about how making S1s
doesn't necessarily need to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial retail project, that making S1s
is often a intermediary step when
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, like making your own tools as an
artisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of puts it in a new light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just kind of like ask you that
question generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let you hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you make S1s as part of your breeding
projects and what's your personal use for
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to me, it's really become a crucial
part of breeding projects because for many
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons, but for one reason, it really
allows you to get a look at the gene
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions within the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can understand how those genes in
that one plant are inherited.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do we see the, do we like,
for example, if we're looking at the scent
[SPEAKER_04]: of a plant, if we have a plant that we've
isolated from a population and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: special, we create a self-population from
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can look at that
self-population and say, hey, did that
[SPEAKER_04]: very interesting scent profile from the
parents reappear in the population?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it appears in the entire
population, that's kind of the best case
[SPEAKER_04]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not often the way that it works,
but if all of the plants, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: show a given trait, show that trait,
it's reproduced, then we know that that
[SPEAKER_04]: trait is what we call true breeding or
homozygous in the population or in that
[SPEAKER_04]: parental plant and in the population that
was created from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what that tells us is that if we
want to cross that population or any plant
[SPEAKER_04]: from that population to an unrelated gene
pool or an unrelated plant, we know that
[SPEAKER_04]: the gene responsible for the smell is
going to go along for the cross,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's kind of like, you can think of
it like playing cards, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: those playing cards that people collect
for baseball cards or hockey cards or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, it has all the statistics of the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can kind of think of like the
first generation when we identify the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, that's kind of like getting the
picture at the top of the playing card,
[SPEAKER_04]: but without any of the information,
like the details of the statistics of that
[SPEAKER_04]: player, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we do the self generation and
we start growing out the offspring and
[SPEAKER_04]: taking notes about the different
individuals in that offspring,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can learn a whole lot about the
individual plant that was self.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we can understand about the
cannabinoid ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, is this plant a pure THC plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can kind of stay in that pure
THC category, because I think that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the listeners are coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even within a plant that is pure THC,
it can produce low intermediate or high
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might have like a plant that is
like a 23, 24% plant that has one copy of
[SPEAKER_04]: the high cannabinoid production genes and
one intermediate copy of the, sorry,
[SPEAKER_04]: one copy of the intermediate cannabinoid
production genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, just by selfing the
generation, we can start to learn about
[SPEAKER_04]: the different genes that are within the
individual that we've selected from our
[SPEAKER_04]: population, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we talk about preservation,
if I'm growing a new, let's just use the
[SPEAKER_04]: land race example, because that's an easy
one for people to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get some seeds from Thailand,
I grow at a hundred, I find a very special
[SPEAKER_04]: individual, or sorry, the first thing I'll
do is I'm growing, if I'm growing a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred plants, you'll throw away the
obvious dogs, the plants that are just
[SPEAKER_04]: terrible for whatever set of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like to do that chemically in the
first generation of a wild population,
[SPEAKER_04]: because those dog or weird plants that are
kind of ugly and underperforming,
[SPEAKER_04]: they may have rare cannabinoid genes in
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we're looking for a rare gene,
just that one trait enough is enough to
[SPEAKER_04]: select the individual, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But typically when you're growing the
family, you will let all the plants breed
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your first true, I call it like
raw gene capture or gene preservation,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're trying to essentially
capture everything that exists within the
[SPEAKER_04]: population that you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second step is selection, where we
actually go through that population and we
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the female plants, and we start
selecting those plants based on any given
[SPEAKER_04]: set of traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: One type of breeding that you can do is
take that selected female individual that
[SPEAKER_04]: has all the open pollinated seeds from all
the different fertilizers or the different
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen donors in that population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like half selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's selected by the female, but it's
really unselected by the pollen donors
[SPEAKER_04]: that hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that female plant has a really special
trait that we want to examine,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't want any of those other pollen
contributors in the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in that case, you take that
individual plant and you do create S1 seed
[SPEAKER_04]: from that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you've preserved not the entire
genes of the entire population,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you've preserved the genetic
recombination of the genetic history of
[SPEAKER_04]: that one specific plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see those things as, you know,
that's kind of the two ranges of any
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding project with selfing being the
most inbreeding step.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you found a very rare,
unusual plant that doesn't resemble
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else in the population,
you don't really want to cross it back to
[SPEAKER_04]: anything else in the population,
because there's a pretty good chance that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to lose that trait in
subsequent generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way to really keep it pure or
to ensure that you're crossing that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: with another plant that has the same trait
is to breed it, like I said before,
[SPEAKER_04]: to breed it with itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really allows you to examine the
heterozygosity or the homozygosity of that
[SPEAKER_04]: one specific plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Caleb, you had something about
homozygosity and heterozygosity that you
[SPEAKER_04]: really wanted to talk about with regard to
S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that's a good
opportunity now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I was just curious what your
opinion are on utilizing S1s and then
[SPEAKER_02]: further generations like S2s in making
lines that are much more the correct term,
[SPEAKER_02]: homozygos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think probably the best thing to do
is I'll make a diagram that we could put
[SPEAKER_04]: up on Instagram when this episode airs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But essentially,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be hard for some people that
don't understand what a Punnett square is,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're going to introduce the concept
of a Punnett square.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a Punnett square is a way of
symbolically looking at the hypothetical
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosomes of an individual plant,
or sorry, in the genetic combinations that
[SPEAKER_04]: come when crossing two individual plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the result, what you'll be able to see
in the diagram that I show is that when we
[SPEAKER_04]: mate one plant to itself, any trait that
is heterozygous, which means, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: we all have to remember, every person that
is listening to this chromosome,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have 23 sets of chromosomes,
one set of chromosome you inherited from
[SPEAKER_04]: your mother and one set you inherited from
your father.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for any trait, eye color,
height, hair color, blood type,
[SPEAKER_04]: one piece of the genetic information was
inherited from your mother and one piece
[SPEAKER_04]: of the genetic information was inherited
from your father.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those two pieces of genetic information is
on opposite chromosome for any trait,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can either be the same or they can be
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you have blue eyes, for example,
you have two copies of the same blue eyed
[SPEAKER_04]: gene on each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have brown eyes, you could either
have two copies of the brown eyed trait or
[SPEAKER_04]: you could have one copy of the brown eyed
trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the cannabis plant world,
selfing a plant and looking at the ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: of just one given trait in the offspring
tells us whether our parental plant was
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous or heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the plant, for example, let's go back
to our pink pistol plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, pink pistol plant maybe is not a
great one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll use it anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you use a pink pistol plant and we
self that plant, if all of the offspring
[SPEAKER_04]: from that self cross have pink pistols,
we can say that the trait responsible for
[SPEAKER_04]: the pink pistols in the parent was
homozygous.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, the parent had two copies
of that pink pistol gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we had another, I guess we'd use
the pink pistols plants again in another
[SPEAKER_04]: example, if we had a pink pistol plant and
we crossed it to itself and in the
[SPEAKER_04]: offspring, only 50% of the offspring had
that pink pistol trait, we would know that
[SPEAKER_04]: that parental plant has more than one set
of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the offspring we would see say
three individuals with pink pistols and
[SPEAKER_04]: one individual with call it purple
pistols.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by looking at self populations,
we can essentially examine the degree of
[SPEAKER_04]: heterozygosity of a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing that we know, and I'll show
this in the diagram that we post,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that every generation of selfing
produces 25% greater homozygosity,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means we're increasing the
inbreeding at every generation by 25% and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're actually purging 25% of the genetic
variation if we only look at one
[SPEAKER_04]: individual going down that S1,
S2, S3 line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if what you were saying, Caleb,
you might have a plant, and that legend OG
[SPEAKER_04]: plant might be a good example.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original plant has little in the
flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you self legend, I think it's one in
three come back with the desired scent
[SPEAKER_04]: profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you select that individual
plant and breed it again, you can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: get to a condition where all the plants
have the desired scent profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because we've removed through
inbreeding the heterozygosity at that one
[SPEAKER_04]: specific genetic spot on the chromosome,
which is what we call a genetic locus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, like serially in lines,
we can start inbreeding very heavily for
[SPEAKER_04]: specific traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is when we do that with
cannabis, which is also an obligate
[SPEAKER_04]: out-crosser like humans are, we kind of
run into this problem that the royal
[SPEAKER_04]: families around the world have run into
through inbreeding is that while sure
[SPEAKER_04]: you're keeping the blood blue and pure,
and in our case, we might actually be
[SPEAKER_04]: selecting for things that we like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always in plant breeding,
there's always this concept of like the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic neighbors of the trait that we
like, they come along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if those genetic neighbors are like
below average or like negative traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can actually be doing genetic
damage to the population as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we keep, when we get down
to say S1, at S1, you won't just look at,
[SPEAKER_04]: say we grow 100 S1 seeds and we find five
plants that are special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually what I'll do is I'll take the best
plant, well, depending on the project,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take the best plant and I'll
fertilize itself, I'll do a set F1 seed
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the best plant, but I'll also take
that plant pollen and I'll fertilize the
[SPEAKER_04]: siblings, the sisters, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I have the time and the space or
the project is really important,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll actually self all those individual
sisters as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now from S1 down to S3,
we don't just follow one, the population
[SPEAKER_04]: from one individual, we'll follow
populations from each of the individuals,
[SPEAKER_04]: always looking to make sure that the
traits that are important to us come along
[SPEAKER_04]: for the ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're also gonna see that some of
those families that we've created have bad
[SPEAKER_04]: traits and we wanna throw those ones away,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a factor of inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we start inbreeding, we have
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to take precautionary measures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a follow-up on that,
Caleb, or should I move on?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I agree, especially with
breeding into the S2, S3 populations to
[SPEAKER_02]: really lock down those certain traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you ever get a finished
product because they get so bad to inbred
[SPEAKER_02]: that just because you've locked down the
traits you want, you don't get a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of an excellent growing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vigor goes down exponentially,
it seems, with each self-degeneration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's absolutely the case,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same royal trouble,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but it's an important step that we
have to get to because, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's go back 50 years and look what
happened when we started getting cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: from all over the world, people in
California and elsewhere, but California
[SPEAKER_04]: was kind of the hot spot because you could
grow a lot of these different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One year, you'd get some lumbo from
Columbia and you'd grow that out and it
[SPEAKER_04]: would be awesome and you'd start growing
that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next year, somebody would show up
with some tie bud and you'd keep some
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds of that and you'd be like,
okay, well, let's cross the tie into the
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on and on and on, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so over generations and generations,
we had all these relatively pure
[SPEAKER_04]: populations that were geographically
isolated all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they came to California for this
big kind of shuffle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're in this phase where we've
really raised the level of quality from
[SPEAKER_04]: back then, but we're still stuck in the
shuffle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we need to get to really move to
that next level of breeding where you have
[SPEAKER_04]: lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: When this happened with corn and they
started really not domesticating corn,
[SPEAKER_04]: but really call it industrializing and
getting the academic institutions all over
[SPEAKER_04]: the world involved in producing bigger,
better, badder corn so that we can feed
[SPEAKER_04]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went through this same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow in all these families from all
over the world and you'd start inbreeding
[SPEAKER_04]: them because you want to keep your
breeding populations pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them would start having these
bad, deleterious traits would show up,
[SPEAKER_04]: negative traits would show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of those things where the
only way out is through, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you inbreed and you inbreed and
the line goes to crap, but sometimes you
[SPEAKER_04]: can actually inbreed it and you can remove
the crap and all of a sudden you've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: line that's true breeding and it's
actually really quite good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we also have to remember cannabis
as an obligate out-crosser.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things about that obligate
out-crossing mating system that cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and humans have is that we never really
get rid of genetic variation, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as everybody around the world,
I'm talking humans, is breeding and having
[SPEAKER_04]: kids, we don't have, if you look at the
human population as a whole, we don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: one true breeding type.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have all these different variations
existing all over the world, all these
[SPEAKER_04]: different versions of genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as the humans keep breeding,
those things never go away, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the opposite is true for
inbreeding species.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we take a human population or say we
take like a hundred human populations and
[SPEAKER_04]: we start inbreeding them, which is,
you know, ethical and unthinkable in our
[SPEAKER_04]: society.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, from a purely academic
point of view, if we were to start to
[SPEAKER_04]: mating and inbreeding families,
what would happen is all these bad traits
[SPEAKER_04]: would show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all this stuff that these genetic
weaknesses, disease, and all the sorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff would show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But theoretically, if we did those
inbreedings in large enough populations,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'd find genetic individuals from those
populations that didn't have any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: bad alleles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just because of their genetic lottery
and their genetic history, they only ended
[SPEAKER_04]: up with the good genes and not the bad
genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you then take those individuals and
cross them together, now you've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: population that is highly inbred,
but has gotten rid of all the crap,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so corn went through this 150 years
ago or a hundred years ago, more like 150
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago when they really started
developing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, the only way out is
through, you have to weed your way through
[SPEAKER_04]: all the crap and inbreed and accept that
you're going to get all this junk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the idea is to brush away the junk and
in between, in the mix, is like the
[SPEAKER_04]: diamonds are there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we blow all the dust and the crap away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we've got the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we start crossing the diamonds
together, now we've got diamonds
[SPEAKER_04]: reproducing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're a long way from there with
cannabis, but that is theoretically one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the ways to get through this is where we
take all of these diverse populations with
[SPEAKER_04]: all this heterozygosity that we've built
into them, one, by cannabis' breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: strategy, but also two, the way that we've
been crossing Colombian to Thai to Afghani
[SPEAKER_04]: to white widow to OG to sour diesel,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's always crossing in the next new
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's really stopping and saying,
okay, let's not introduce new stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go down and find these individual
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the last 15 years, we're starting
to see this and the freak show guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: high grade mutants, I mean, they're one
example of this where they said,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, we're not going to go out crossing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to inbreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they inbreed it based on one leaf
morphology, but they created something
[SPEAKER_04]: totally new, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole new kind of variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it a variety because it reproduces
from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trait reproduces went through from
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a way, DJ Short did the same thing,
you know, back 50, 20 or 25 years ago with
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry that he kind of said,
he kind of said, I'm not going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: across.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only going to inbreed in my little
pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and arguably what came out is
like a little bit on, it suffers from
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding depression, but it's a great
line to use for hybridizing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's fixed the purple trait and
he's fixed a couple of other things in
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, in the stems and the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what you have to do in
plant breeding is you have to go,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to force your way through the
heterozygosity to develop homozygous true
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you're doing, Caleb,
by going down S2, S3, S4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get to that point in time though,
the question becomes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do you have?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've essentially got like an heirloom
variety that's probably kind of inbred and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not going to be as good as your
hybrid variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a performance, you know, when I say as
good, I mean, it's not going to perform as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not what you're going to put on the
market and the customers are going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: to want to buy to plant feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to want something with more
vigor and size to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it's true breeding like that,
now you have a real tool that you can use
[SPEAKER_04]: to test cross against your different lines
that have also gone through that same kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you start crossing those things
back together, you're going to see again,
[SPEAKER_04]: that real true hybrid vigor that the
people in the sixties and seventies were
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing when they would cross Columbian to
Thai.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've got two true breeding lines
that are distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they come together, now you've
got like a real F1 seed, which arguably
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't really exist in today's Canada
seed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ryan, in one of your examples where
you've got all of these inbred humans and
[SPEAKER_01]: then one group are developing all these
great traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this other group are developing
all these negative traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, that sounds like a premise
for a new Marvel movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all of the all of the great traits
become like the superhero and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: negative traits become like the villain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, boom, now we've just got two
hours of sci fi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, Caleb, you know, we know that you
make S1s that you share with all of us as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of your own breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we understand better now how creating
S1s helps lock down particular traits for
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are making these S1s for your
bigger breeding project, do you find that
[SPEAKER_01]: you make multiple S1s of different,
I guess I'll say, phenos of a plant so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can say, OK, I've S1ed this one
because I like the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've S1ed this one because I prefer the
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done this one because it finishes
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now that I've got this pool of
S1s, now I'm going to breed these,
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping to capture the best of all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my more recent ones I've been
working on is the purple urkels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I grew out over a hundred of
them and I made, you know, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: give or take a dozen selections,
maybe more, for different traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never, I never try to,
you know, select just for one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, on one I selected for like
the, you know, the orange chocolatey
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and on another I selected for
just, you know, the big purple flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't all for just one trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the, you know, the sister
sister, I guess, generation, I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically know what to call those if
they're S2s or, or what would you call
[SPEAKER_02]: those where you breed a S1 with its S1
sister, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the correct trait?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a, it would be a SimCross.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be, you might denote it like S1.
[SPEAKER_04]: S1 F2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I was kind of thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when we're labeling those things,
it's really like the important thing is to
[SPEAKER_04]: give a code that you know, obviously,
and it means something to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the only other real
important thing about naming plants or at
[SPEAKER_04]: least the generations is to convey that
information to somebody else so that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can understand what the genetic condition
might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I get seeds, I kind of like to know
how homozygous or heterozygous they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just jump in on one quick point that
like, I'm kind of along the line that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shango, you asked if you, if you,
if you self different individuals from an
[SPEAKER_04]: S1 seed, one reason you might do that,
for example, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were back when we were breeding
THC and CBD ratios, you know, say the
[SPEAKER_04]: original plant is a one to one THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you cross that plant to itself,
we end up with a population that is like
[SPEAKER_04]: roughly a one to two to one ratio of THC
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you call it 25% THC plants,
50% CBD and THC plants, and then 25% CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in order to prove to yourself,
and this is kind of an obvious thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, you know, it applies to other traits
other than just cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to prove to yourself the
inheritance pattern of those traits,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you would do is self one of the THC
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd again self one of the one to one and
then you'd self one of the CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd see when you self the THC plant,
they all have THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you self the CBD plant, they all have
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you self the one to one, you get that
25% to 50%, the 25% ratio of THC to one to
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, it's, you know, for example,
say we go to, in the purple generations
[SPEAKER_04]: that Caleb is talking about, he's working
with some purple crosses and he crosses,
[SPEAKER_04]: he has a special plant and it's purple
highlights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he thinks it's really
interesting scent and I'm going to make an
[SPEAKER_04]: S1, I don't know, of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grows the S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: 25% of the plants are completely purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50% of the plants look like the mother and
then 25% of the plants are completely
[SPEAKER_04]: green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're trying to understand and
prove to yourself what happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd self one of each archetype and then
see what happens in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and what that tells you is like,
okay, you know, if, if we learned that the
[SPEAKER_04]: purple plants breed true, and the green
plants breed true, but when we cross them
[SPEAKER_04]: together, we get purple with, or green
with purple stripes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: now we understand the building blocks that
we have to have in order to put back the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the final product, which is, you know,
we want it to be green with purple
[SPEAKER_04]: stripes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sometimes it has nothing to do with
moving a project forward other than trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to understand how does this trait inherit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's one really good example or one
use of, of how to use an S1 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let, let's take this in a, in a
different direction now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far we've been talking about using
S1 to capture a particular trait because,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want to use it in, in, in a larger
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know there's a lot of folks like me
who, who pick up S1 seeds, not because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: planning on breeding it, but because I'm
attracted to looking at the variations
[SPEAKER_01]: within a genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, two summers ago, I popped
several packs of Caleb's Skittles S1
[SPEAKER_01]: because I like the original Skittles
strain, but I'd also like to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what else is in there that was
not the, you know, the championship cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ran a whole bunch of these,
these Skittles S1s and it was an absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: delight, you know, to see this variety,
you know, subtle differences in colors,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of differences in terpene profiles,
some differences in internode length.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like different, you know,
it's just like going to a party,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, and, and that's,
that's a bad example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it's just, it was,
it's just cool to see a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: riffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this same plant that I really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my, my question to you,
Caleb, and, and then I've got a follow-up
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to go to you, Ryan,
is when you are, now that you've made so
[SPEAKER_01]: many S1s, like let, let's say that
they're, that I'm going to pop a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would be fricking awesome,
but not something I'm probably likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, and the idea is so that we can
capture as much of the genome
[SPEAKER_01]: representation as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many different expressions would you
expect to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you seeing that when you,
when you visualize all, air quotes,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the different expressions that are
captured in that seed, that you're all
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, there's, there's usually like,
you know, 10 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, you could say there,
there might be a thousand different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties or maybe 800 different
varieties, because we know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic picture is very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the S1 is supposed to capture that
picture, then, then if we pop a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of S1 seeds, we might see that same
genome expressed a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so how I kind of expect this answer to
go is I like to find out what you normally
[SPEAKER_01]: see from your experience since you're on
the front lines doing this, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then Ryan, I'd love for you
to address this idea that, that S1s are an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual snapshot of what can be expressed
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of similar to a question I
get a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ask, how many phenotypes are you
going to see with these S1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a really tough question
because say if I'm running out a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: and something Urkel S1s or a hundred
something Mendo Purple S1s, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: both of those lines or both of those cuts
S1, they, the plants look very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in veg, you know, there's not a huge
amount of difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get into flower, you know,
the plants still look the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's all these different flower
types and coloration patterns and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's where the huge segregation
is, you know, with the Mendo Purple as an
[SPEAKER_02]: example, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, I mean, they all look, you know,
plant wise, like the same phenotype or
[SPEAKER_02]: genotype or whatever, but you know,
it's, it's those, you know, those terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and the, and the flower, you know,
structures and colors that are the real
[SPEAKER_02]: variables on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally, I don't even know how to,
you know, quantify how many phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know, individuals there
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's kind of always been a
tough question for me, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a flawed question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even, and I think it, it comes
because people don't really understand the
word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you lean away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you lean away from your microphone,
Ryan?
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I sat back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned up the gain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a flawed question because
people don't understand what the word
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype means, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so for example, let's have an
example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, oh, you, you're growing,
cookies cross chem and you've got the
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies phenotype because it's got those
little rounded leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So anytime you see those little rounded
leaves, people will look at it and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's the cookies phenotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it might only be that it only has
the rounded leaves from the cookies,
[SPEAKER_04]: but every other trait looks like the chem,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's, you know, it's like,
imagine we're going to start categorizing
[SPEAKER_04]: actors and we say, Oh yeah, Tom Cruise,
he's got like brown hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then and then all of a sudden anybody
that you see that has the brown hair,
[SPEAKER_04]: you start calling the Tom Cruise
phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we do in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, nothing could be further from the
truth because as we know, anybody that has
[SPEAKER_04]: brown hair, it doesn't mean that you're
Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that just because you have
brown hair, you're Tom Cruise,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that should be self evident,
but for some reason in the cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_04]: we tend to think that, Oh, if you have
this one trait from that one genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: background, the assumption is like the
entire plant must have all the other
[SPEAKER_04]: traits that also come with that genetic
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not how genetics work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of Mendel's laws, which is Mendel is
kind of like the grandfather of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of inheritance, Gregor Mendel.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can look them up, the few that
haven't heard of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of his laws of inheritance was
independent assortment of traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, so that means like, if you have
blue eyes and brown hair and you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you mate with someone that has brown hair,
that has blonde hair and green eyes,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hair color and the eye color in the
offspring aren't going to be related to
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just because you have brown hair,
it doesn't mean that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: blue eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because you have blonde hair,
it doesn't mean you're going to have green
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can have the reverse combination
of blonde hair and blue eyes or green eyes
[SPEAKER_04]: and brown hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we start looking at like
phenotype based on one trait, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: really going to go down the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_04]: To wrap that back to what you were talking
about, Shango, and like how many
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypes exist, phenotype is really,
is usually in reference to one trait,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if we're talking about,
you know, you were talking about like
[SPEAKER_04]: internode length.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, there's going to be
three, internode length types within a
[SPEAKER_04]: population, say short, internode length,
intermediate internode length,
[SPEAKER_04]: and long internode length, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But all those long internode lengths,
some might smell like cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some like smell like pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some like smell like grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some might smell like, you know,
tropical Hawaii kind of mango scent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we categorize them all by saying,
oh, those are the, those are the long
[SPEAKER_04]: internode lengths, that's not a really
helpful way to sort or categorize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grok that, but let me, let me
slightly course correct my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I am less curious about categorizing
what I think of as a phenotype and more
[SPEAKER_01]: interest in categorizing the different
plant expressions I will see over a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I pop a thousand of these S1 seeds
in my head as a not an, not incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific knowledgeable person,
I would think, oh, I want to pop all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these seeds so that I can see all of the
possible expressions of the skittles from
[SPEAKER_01]: my example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if every one of those
expressions would be considered a pheno or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: More to the point, like let's say I pop a
thousand seeds and, and first one has,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a very flowery, short plant,
dark green color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second one is got a different smell
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens to be a very tall plant,
but it's got the same color.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one, it's got a totally
different color, but this one oddly smells
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more chem-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got this like odd pink pistol,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if, if each plant in the,
these thousand S1 seeds are a different
[SPEAKER_01]: mix and match of the potential in the
genome, I'm simply curious how many seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to pop to see everything that
the gene could do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, that's, it's a very complicated
question, although it sounds simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, it was very easy for me to
say, I don't know how, there is an answer,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we have to kind of work through it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to, if we may, I'd like to
start with it by saying, don't use the
[SPEAKER_04]: word phenotype or how many phenotypes what
I see and instead substitute the word
[SPEAKER_04]: individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really changes the concept,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because phenotypes are a grouping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I am thinking about individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more what I'm thinking in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's, it's more appropriate
because genetically they are individual
[SPEAKER_04]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could refer to every plant as a
genotype because the genetic type of that
[SPEAKER_04]: individual is unique from all the other
individuals in the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I like the word
individual because it really kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: hammers home that we're not talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you use words like strain or
phenotype, it kind of says all these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point that I think we're really
asking or we're trying to hit home is
[SPEAKER_04]: that, Hey, all these plants are,
I are individual individually and unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're different from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the important part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the question is how many will we see
in a population?
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember S one is a technique,
not a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we look at it from that lens,
how different and how many individuals,
[SPEAKER_04]: any given S one population are going to
have, how many different, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: air quote phenotypes or visually
chemically distinguishable individuals is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be related to how true breeding
the plant that we used to inbreed and
[SPEAKER_04]: create the S one generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our Colombian cross Thai, I'm going to
switch it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's call it Thai crossed Afghani because
those two plants are like visually less
[SPEAKER_04]: similar than Colombian and Thai,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Afghani is real stocky, small,
wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Thai is the polar opposite tall,
thin leaves, very different flower
[SPEAKER_04]: structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we cross those two plants together or
together, we hunt, call it a thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We find the super individual from that
hybrid between the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we self that individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: The S one generation from that individual
is going to be a spectrum of plants from
[SPEAKER_04]: the Afghani all the way to the Thai and
every possible combination in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is an example where we self or
we've created a segregating generation of
[SPEAKER_04]: an F one hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Separately, if we took that individual
Afghani plant that we crossed to the Thai
[SPEAKER_04]: and instead of crossing it to the Thai,
we create a reversed male version of that
[SPEAKER_04]: clone using hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: We self fertilize it and create an S one
generation from that Afghani plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we grow it a thousand of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those plants are going to look more or
less the same as the Afghani mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because that Afghani plant was
a true breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see same process.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made S ones from two individual plants,
but we had very different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those outcomes were directly related
to the degree of heterozygosity or genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity that existed in the plant that
we selfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it comes down to, excuse me,
what it comes down to is the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals in that S one population
really just depends on how true breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is that I asked one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if that original parent,
the solo parent, it was a very well-worked
[SPEAKER_01]: line and it tends to breed truish,
there'll be a lot less variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's a whole bunch of stuff that
went into it and it's never been refined,
[SPEAKER_01]: well then there's going to be a whole hell
of a lot to sift through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one other measure,
measure that people in the community might
[SPEAKER_04]: have come across.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be everybody that's
going to know this, but back during the
[SPEAKER_04]: phylos days and some of the other genetic
company testing companies that are doing
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic testing, they would provide you
with a number that essentially was how
[SPEAKER_04]: true breeding is your plant or what's the
level of homozygosity or heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more heterozygosity, that that test
would show on a plant would equate to the
[SPEAKER_04]: more types of individuals you will see if
that plant is inbred and had self seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: made from that one plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we cross two plants together,
we're talking about, I mean, you said
[SPEAKER_04]: before, we're talking about someone's
genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have to remember, Shango,
you've got two genomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two genomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caleb has two genomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all think of it as Shango's genome,
Caleb's genome, Ryan's genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, we have two different genomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One genome that we inherited from the
mother and one genome that we inherited
[SPEAKER_04]: from dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any trait for which those two genetic
chromosomes are the same from mom and dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant or the person will breed true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any sections of the chromosomes where
those chromosomes are different between
[SPEAKER_04]: the parents, in cannabis, if we self
those, those traits are where we'd see it
[SPEAKER_04]: on the variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, the degree of genetic
similarity between the two mated
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals, or I guess we'd call them
grandparents at this time, because our
[SPEAKER_04]: individual that we're selfing is creating
the grandchildren's, the grandchildren
[SPEAKER_04]: generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're looking at is the chromosomes
that were inherited from grandmother and
[SPEAKER_04]: grandfather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's no easy answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is quite a complex answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just begs further questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: How varied is the S1 going to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how true breeding is the plant that
we're using to create the S1 generation?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really answering our question,
which is never satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's bring this second set to a close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've got something to say here before
the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are the kind of person that
absolutely geeked out and loved the deep
[SPEAKER_01]: science that we've just hit over the last
40 minutes, and you wish Ryan would just
[SPEAKER_01]: keep talking in this same way,
boy, do I have an episode for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on back to Shaping Fighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to require episode 64 on female
only breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is Ryan providing these sorts of
insights for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, much of it was over
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a problem saying that,
because the dude's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he just kind of took the ball and ran
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you love this, definitely go
back to episode 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will enjoy the hell of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if this kind of science is just kind
of like on the edge of what your interest
[SPEAKER_01]: level is, stay around for set three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because next set is going to be kind of a
different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start off with Caleb
walking us through what he does in his
[SPEAKER_01]: garden to actually breed these S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to be a little bit more
hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb taking us through what he actually
does in case you want to, in case you're
[SPEAKER_01]: now in totally intrigued by S1s and you
want to try your hand at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go ahead and take our
last short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guests today are Caleb and Specta
and Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've discovered the benefits of
using cannabis, it's a very small step to
[SPEAKER_01]: start making your own edibles,
gummies, lotions, tinctures, and
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated oils at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magical butter has been helping cannabis
consumers become self-sufficient for over
[SPEAKER_01]: a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the easy to use magical butter
countertop botanical extractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can create high quality cannabis
products to your exact specifications at a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of the cost of store bought
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk a lot on this show about the
importance of home growing so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to rely on others to feel healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the magical butter machine can
empower your personal health by putting
[SPEAKER_01]: you in control of how you use cannabis in
your daily life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been making my own butters and oils
on the stove for years, and I much prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: the ease of using the magical butter
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just set it and walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the simple touch of a button,
the magical butter machine grinds,
[SPEAKER_01]: heats, stirs, and steeps your herbs and

[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend HEMBRA Genetics Collection to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HEMBRA, spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.

[SPEAKER_01]: But as we have discussed many times on
Shaping Fire, a greenhouse is only as good
[SPEAKER_01]: as the environment you create for the
plants inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biotherm has been on the forefront of
developing and installing highly efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse solutions since 1980.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guests
today are Ryan Lee and Caleb Inspekta.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, let's bring this on home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we talked about
S1s and what they are, both from a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific perspective and also from a
usability and what we're doing with them
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis community direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the second set, we dug in
deeply to S1 action.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the attributes and what we will
see in the genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: This set three will be a little bit
shorter, I expect, because we are gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on the actual making of S1s,
which is absolutely a skill, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: quite as lengthy as some of the other
things that we may do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Caleb, since you are the guy who
does this more than anybody I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate it if you would take us
through a step-by-step tutorial on how you
[SPEAKER_01]: produce S1s in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as level of detail,
certainly we have got a whole bunch of OGs
[SPEAKER_01]: who are listening who are gonna be
familiar with everything that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, but also recognize that we've got
a whole bunch of new breeders here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so go through it in a little bit a
little more detail than you would if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were just sitting around with Ryan having
this conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, here, I'll hand you the
mic and walk us through it, would you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a handful of years ago, I never really
thought about how long it took a full run
[SPEAKER_02]: of S1s, but somebody asked, hey,
can you make me this S1?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I basically broke it down for
myself and them, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that it takes about six
months from start to finish to make one
[SPEAKER_02]: full S1 run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you pick your mother plants
when you wanna S1, and then you gotta get
[SPEAKER_02]: your stock up, veg them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I don't work on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: My smallest reversal room is 3K and most
of them are 4K to 6K.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, so I'm filling up a good size
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mean like 3,000 plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what 3K means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably my novice, but what does
that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: 3,000 to 6,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, watts, okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so three to 6,000 watt lights per
row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so basically, veg time,
I usually give my plants about two months
[SPEAKER_02]: veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm also using eight to 12,
five to six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five gallon plants that are usually about
two foot by two foot as the reversal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also do different variations on what
I spray on them, because in my experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: not all plants reverse the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants do early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants do late as far as pollen drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a good bit of variation on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I lose you there, Shango?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, you've got the floor,
that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some plants, they'll drop pollen as
early as like week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others will drop pollen week six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically have to spray some plants
two weeks before the rest of them and
[SPEAKER_02]: others right at the trigger of the regular
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who aren't as familiar with the
spraying process, what is it that you are
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying and what do you like to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally use EXE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also use STS based products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally, lately, it's been EXE from
Hybritech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the results are still
variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of plants don't reverse with just
one spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're using EXE or STS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always make sure I spray two times to
at least half the plants I reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually, the garden's fully pollinated
about four to five weeks into reversing
[SPEAKER_02]: the room, which is anywhere from four to
seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the reversal plants are sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the total time the rooms take is
generally 11 to 14 weeks from start to
[SPEAKER_02]: finish as far as producing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I generally try to give them six
to eight weeks for the seeds to ripen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, the drying process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally takes a couple few weeks as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the grinding of the flowers and the
separating and the blowing of the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it takes a good six months to
produce just one run of S1 and feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many different rooms are you generally
working on at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you drop these S1s pretty
regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last couple of years, I've had
seven rooms that I'm working constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I harvest these rooms one day and I
replant them the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trying, I'm working on
slimming it down a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah, I've just been nonstop in
the garden for way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for any listeners who are like
unfamiliar with using the STS spray on
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to cause them to self-pollinate,
I encourage you to go back to both shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire episode 49 that Caleb was on before
all about feminized seeds and making them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also we hit it up again last time
Ryan was on this show, actually not the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time, but an earlier time,
which is episode 64 on female breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not gonna go into it too much
heavier today, but if you wanna get more
[SPEAKER_01]: nerdy about spraying the plants,
that's where you can find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Caleb, it sounds to me listening to you
describe the process that the keys to
[SPEAKER_01]: making S1s falls in number one,
understanding the recipe and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do each step in order and
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second, the part that has the
most bearing on the seeds is actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: choices that you make in plants before you
even start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the way I do things,
it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because when I do a run, most of the
time I don't have backups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something doesn't produce pollen or
doesn't reverse properly, I pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: lose that full run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, reversals aren't
consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally spray eight to 12 of these
good sized plants every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, you'll have one or two
plants that dump pollen real good,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll have some that just dump a
little and some that don't dump at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody is going in and thinking
they're gonna reverse X, Y, or Z,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they only have one plant, well,
it might reverse, or it might not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I try to hedge my bets and
spray a good amount of them and give them
[SPEAKER_02]: a handful of different multiple sprayings,
and then different times when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced into their vines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll stagger plants for pollen
production being introduced over times,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you also buy how much they get sprayed
as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll generally try to reverse plants two
weeks before the main room, and then one
[SPEAKER_02]: week before the main room, and then the
day of the main room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the day of the main room,
I'll do a second spray on about half of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants from each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're all like, okay, I don't know the
particular best practice for this
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm gonna spread out my window for
when I spray, and I'm gonna spread out my
[SPEAKER_01]: volume for how much I spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because I've had runs where the
pollen drops before you even have any
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, and then I've had runs where,
hell, the plants are practically ripening
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and they're not gonna make any seed
because the pollen drops so late.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG cushions tend to lean towards that end
of the spectrum, where the other side,
[SPEAKER_02]: like trainwreck and mendo purple,
they tend to drop the pollen real early,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you don't even have flowers to
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that there isn't one,
but it's worth asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are looking for candidates that
you are gonna reverse, have you determined
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's any kind of a signal or a
sign which plants are gonna be more
[SPEAKER_01]: successful reversing than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it something that's hidden in the
genes for you, and you just can't tell by
[SPEAKER_01]: looking or seeing how they act?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I haven't seen any type of a sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awfully convenient though,
wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, sour diesel,
most people who've tried to reverse that
[SPEAKER_02]: have, most people don't succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though that sour diesel in general,
it'll hermaphrodite pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No questions asked, but I don't think the
pollen is too viable most of that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking for plants that herm isn't
necessarily a good sign for plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: will reverse successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a little tangent there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what the... So you do different
timings of when you spray and different
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes of when you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was a center of that target where
you would recommend that most people
[SPEAKER_01]: start, meaning where in the life cycle and
how much spray, what would you say would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the center of that target for somebody
who's trying to do this for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, reversing your plants two
weeks before is probably the best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then- Two weeks before they start to
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, two weeks, you reverse, you spray your
plant and you start flowering it two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: before you flower the target plant or the
target room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the best one generally for me is
when I spray two weeks before and then
[SPEAKER_02]: also when I flip the room, I spray it
again, usually with like a half strength
[SPEAKER_02]: dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not to hurt the plants too much,
but just to kind of make sure the ethylene
[SPEAKER_02]: is kept down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by hurt the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times when you use, well,
EXE for example, it'll cook your plants up
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good and it'll put them on pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say cook them up, do you mean
like you're actually seeing like chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: burns on the outside of the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, chemical burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of just crinkled up, just twisted up
foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually pictured this as being
such a rough process on the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm actually getting a really
different picture now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be, it sounds like it can be
traumatic with some individual plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that the, when you're doing
this, that the seeds take any longer to
[SPEAKER_01]: form or to set or, you know, for people
who have just, you know, pollen chucked
[SPEAKER_01]: before, they kind of generally have an
idea how long this takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the, the reversing process is
completed, is the seed ripening and
[SPEAKER_01]: removal process, is that all the same as
we'd see with like just regular photo
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I generally let them go six to
eight weeks, six on the minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty standard as far as just
whether it's S1s, feminized or regular
[SPEAKER_02]: runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I want to name check a bunch of
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, cause you know, you have reversed
so many and you've already made some like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of jokes about plants that are easier
or harder to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you just kind of like, you know,
go through your head and, and tell us a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of the plants that you find that
are easier to reverse and some that are
[SPEAKER_01]: harder for people who are looking to
attempt this, that might kind of inform
[SPEAKER_01]: their decision about what they want to
try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon party was very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem dog number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like, basically those ones,
the easy ones, you know, those almost are
[SPEAKER_02]: like having a male in your room where you
just put them in front of the fan and the
[SPEAKER_02]: fan blows the pollen all over the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are more of the rare, rare
exceptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the harder ones would be like
triangle Kush, Irene, Skittles,
[SPEAKER_02]: being extreme examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you basically have to kind of
collect the pollen individually and just
[SPEAKER_02]: manually pollinate everything in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those, those ones definitely take
a lot of work comparatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely been some anomalies
like, you know, for example, with Irene,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I pollinated you know,
the better part of a full light of Irene,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it was just half a light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I put, you know,
a good amount of pollen on that and I got
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 seeds, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there was, you know, a row of
triangle Kush right next to them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: other bed, you know, under the other
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like 750 seeds from just you
know, the excess of pollen that I'd blown
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was almost like the Irene didn't
take its own pollen or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: whereas the, you know, the hybrids with
the TK actually, you know, produce seed
[SPEAKER_02]: with that same exact pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of different
variables and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like what we want and need to
pass on to anybody doing this for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time is if you run into challenges
and obstacles, take it easy on yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is this sounds like this is
this is not just point and shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds like there is a lot of hassle
and needed experience and hell luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, there's a good handful
of plants that, you know, they'll revert
[SPEAKER_02]: back to just normal flower, especially if
you only spray them one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even sometimes when you spray them
twice, it just won't reverse well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others will reverse 100 percent and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they won't they won't have any pollen
at all in them, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's really inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just like you say, point and
shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tricky sometimes right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to kind of wrap wrap up our discussion
for today, Ryan, I want to I want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something very specific from you that you
said during our last time when we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about female breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already, you know, as far as like
the the two things that are most often
[SPEAKER_01]: said about about s ones, the first one
being like, oh, s ones are clones of of
[SPEAKER_01]: the parent plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have very effectively dispelled
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: During today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing, though, is because s
ones are female seeds, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people saying, you know, incorrectly
calling it herming, you know, that that
[SPEAKER_01]: all these these these feminine seeds herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you share your thoughts on the
expectation that femme seeds will throw
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got a you've got a very
strident and scientifically based opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: on the likelihood for for feminized seeds
to throw male followers or show intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so please drop that on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, again, I think a lot of these
expectations come from, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: where we've come from in the cannabis
community over the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm going to use air quotes around
the word feminized, when feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: were first introduced to the cannabis
industry, and I should probably state that
[SPEAKER_04]: no other industry uses air quote,
you know, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really a marketing thing that has
been done directed at that cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they were first introduced to the
market, the way that they were made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it's my opinion that the way
that they were made led to an increased
[SPEAKER_04]: level of intersexuality in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wouldn't I don't know if I would
call them true s ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That were made using a chemical inhibitor,
a chemical hormone inhibitor, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: what what we've been talking about today.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ways to do the same thing by
using plants that are already intersex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because we have this thing in plant
breeding, all breeding, really,
[SPEAKER_04]: we say like begets like and that just
means that plants or animals with given
[SPEAKER_04]: traits are more the offspring from those
animals or plants are more likely to also
[SPEAKER_04]: have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we're if we're using parents
that have some degree of intersex
[SPEAKER_04]: expression or, you know, what the cannabis
community calls hermaphroditism,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's also likely that the offspring from
those plants will have some level of
[SPEAKER_04]: intersexuality or hermaphroditism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that what we're what we've
seen in the past is that some methods of
[SPEAKER_04]: creating feminized seeds do lead to more
intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The methods that we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, will only amplify the traits that
any given plant have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we use plants that are not likely to
be intersex as the parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more likely that the offspring will
also be free from intersex.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're learning through the process
of more people making female female
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses with many more plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the cannabis gene pool that we're
starting to learn that, yes, some plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, will have strange occurrences
with the sexual expression of in the
[SPEAKER_04]: offspring.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have an example of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a sour diesel cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Caleb was mentioning sour diesel
earlier in the problems with using it as a
[SPEAKER_04]: reversal plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually used it as a target plant in a
female female cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it received pollen from a hazy like
plant that I use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a small percentage, I'd say probably
six out of one hundred and fifty plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe four hundred come up looking like
male plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're genetically female, but they look
phenotypically as if they were males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't always happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, sour diesel cross to other
things doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's like and the pollen donor
plant is also not known to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have self plants of that that
expression, that genetic individual,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it doesn't produce any intersex
offspring at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something to do with those two
plants coming together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a genetic phenomenon called
complementation that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's usually where there's two genes
that are required for a specific
[SPEAKER_04]: interaction to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one plant might have one of those
genes not showing the interaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another plant might also not show that
genetic weirdness, but have the other
[SPEAKER_04]: gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when those two plants are crossed
together, a certain subset of the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: do show the weird genetic condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be an example of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're definitely learning that,
I think, like Caleb was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, not every plant reverses and
produces pollen in the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're also going to learn in
cannabis that there's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different levels of expectation of whether
those plants are going to be will produce
[SPEAKER_04]: intersex sexuality in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are really things that we need
to do as breeders to test cross and ensure
[SPEAKER_04]: that the plants we use don't end up like
that or don't end up contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within all this variability, it sounds
like the rule of thumb to folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially folks who don't have the same
scientific depth you're coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: is don't blame your intersex
characteristics on selfing or feminizing
[SPEAKER_01]: or feminization itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blame the intersexing on traits that
appear in the parent plants and be sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got quality genetics that you start
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if they're not, you know,
I mean, quality or not is really
[SPEAKER_04]: subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might have a plant that has,
like, it's incredible in all other
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics, but it has a little bit
of intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through selfing that plant,
it's like I talked about earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: the only way out is through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be the case where we cross a
plant with some slight intersexuality and
[SPEAKER_04]: we hunt through the feet, the offspring,
and we realize that we find plants in the
[SPEAKER_04]: offspring that don't actually have that
trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, like, every generation of
selfing reduces genetic variability by
[SPEAKER_04]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might be able to, through that
reduction of genetic variability,
[SPEAKER_04]: we might actually remove the negative
traits, in this case, intersex sexuality,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're trying to do away with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so selfing might be a way to advance
removing intersexuality through very tight
[SPEAKER_04]: selection for, you know, strict femaleness
and test crossing those selected
[SPEAKER_04]: individuals, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, selfing is a technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't blame the result on the
technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to understand that the result is a
combination of, well, the result really
[SPEAKER_04]: has to do with the genetic heritage buried
in that offspring that we selfed,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the technique of selfing is just a
tool, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we have in the past made,
people have made some conclusions that
[SPEAKER_04]: blamed the tool rather than understanding
that the tool was only revealing what was
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sound bite I was looking for,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, let's wrap this up,
fellas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first of all, thank you to you,
Ryan, for joining me on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it is always delightful to have you
on the show, to have you both,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, share your humor and charm and
like the deep scientific understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have that we enjoy cutting
through the bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also thank you as well to you,
Caleb, your depth of experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge of these cultivars that we love
so much and your, you know, the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have been doing this for so long means
that you're able to share with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, experiences that we're just not
going to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably earn in our own lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we can all lean on your
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to both you fellas for joining
me today on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you all want to follow up more with
Caleb Inspekta from CSI Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend these three places.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I highly recommend that you
go back to Shaping Fire episode 49 on
[SPEAKER_01]: feminization and making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good show and it gets into a bit
more of the details than we did today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you're going to want
to buy some of Caleb's seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's got he's got a whole he's
got a whole bunch of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about S1s today, but if you go
to his website HumboldtCSI.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find S1s there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find, you know, regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find female, feminized seeds that
are not S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's got a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, you know, if you're if
you're a heady kind of breeder or
[SPEAKER_01]: collector of seeds, you will also find
mixed in with the rest of his seeds his I
[SPEAKER_01]: dare call sub label or associated level
Pirates of the Golden Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pirates of the Emerald Triangle and where
he releases some like much harder to find
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding cherry things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I've got his his pine tar
Kush IBL that's in that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am presently growing his 79
Christmas bud from that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole bunch of great stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally on Instagram,
you're definitely going to want to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb at CSI underscore Humboldt to both
keep up on releases, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot of teaching that goes on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I like about
Caleb's IG is that even though he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, 220,000 followers,
it is not a free for all of trolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the people on his IG generally are
there because they're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and there's a lot of like
community and helping each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we all know we'd like more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so anyway, make sure you check out
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for Ryan Lee, also known as Chimera,
historically, especially on the on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the old forums and stuff,
I recommend that you check out any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes that Ryan has done with me on on
tissue culturing and other topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like regarding today's work,
today's topic, you want to look at episode
[SPEAKER_01]: 64, which is all about female seeds and
breeding with females only.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like if you were in the second set,
you definitely want to check out this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ryan's Instagram is at breeding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, while he does do some
Instagram, it is it is often easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect with him on his Twitter,
actually, which is at Chimera genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimera is C-H-I-M-E-R-A genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find more episodes of Chimera at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And follow on Instagram for all original
content not found on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at shaping fire and at Shango Lose
