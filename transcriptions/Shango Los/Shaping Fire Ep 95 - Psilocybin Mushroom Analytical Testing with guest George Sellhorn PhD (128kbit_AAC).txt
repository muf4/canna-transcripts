[SPEAKER_00]: Know Your Dealer has been a drug culture
safety standard forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis migrates towards whatever
potential legalization the future holds,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the few but important advantages of
the licensed cannabis market is the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very helpful to know which
cannabinoids are dominant in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products, how potent they are,
what terpenes are present, and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are devoid of dangerous pesticides,
molds, and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a modern equivalent of Know Your
Dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do a whole episode on gaming
cannabis analytics to cheat, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole, having cannabis analytics available
to us is an important modern win for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patients and enthusiasts alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic mushrooms are following in the
footsteps of cannabis in so many ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because cannabis has already laid the
groundwork for mushroom legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: many states are rushing to develop legal
frameworks, healthcare standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: and manufacturing rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we have begun to recognize the
importance of analytical labs for
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All mushrooms are not created equal,
and as patients, enthusiasts, and product
[SPEAKER_00]: developers all have increased access to
psilocybin mushrooms, the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what we are ingesting becomes
hugely important.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. George Selhorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Selhorn, PhD, is founder and
principal scientist at Flourish Labs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flourish is one of the first labs in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide analysis of psilocybin
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also been lab director at Rose
City, a cannabis and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: George has 22 years of experience with
liquid chromatography, both preparative
[SPEAKER_00]: and analytical.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's worked in HIV vaccine development as
well as cancer and autoimmune disorder
[SPEAKER_00]: drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: His PhD in molecular plant sciences with
an emphasis in biochemistry is from
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On today's episode, we're gonna get up to
speed on psilocybin analytical labs
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are about to become
incredibly relevant, just like cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: labs have.
[SPEAKER_00]: During set one, we will look closely at
the components of mushrooms and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding of what we are
looking for specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we will talk about
prevention of bad actors gaming the system
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to cheat, like folks do in
cannabis labs, along with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics of mushroom sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this third set, we're gonna
talk about mushroom storage at home and
[SPEAKER_00]: specific varieties of potent mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for bringing your rare
skill set to us, because we're excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by now, most of us understand that with
cannabis analytics, we are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of a range of cannabinoids and
terpenes to help us understand the potency
[SPEAKER_00]: of our flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're curious to start with is
what are the constituents of psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms that we want to measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking at a potency measure when
we're looking at the bio mass of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: or an extract, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are alkaloids in the psilocybin
mushrooms that are target as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenoids in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are five primary ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two that most people know about,
which are psilocin and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's three additional ones,
norsilicin, beocysteine, and
[SPEAKER_01]: norbeocysteine.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the five primary ones that
people look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also an additional sixth analyte,
called arginacine, which can also be found
[SPEAKER_01]: in the psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six total, but five that people mostly
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a feeling people are going
to be more interested in arginacine going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a couple people talk about a
hypothesis that they think that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for some of the wood lover
mushroom issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's toxins from wood lover mushrooms
that can make people sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually a pretty good segue
into why we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason is safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm interested in doing this is
these molecules are quite powerful and
[SPEAKER_01]: have the ability to influence the way
people think quite substantially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this being introduced to a whole
new group of people with the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: of psilocybin in Oregon, we want to make
sure people are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other metabolites, I feel
actually quite rookie about this because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with psilocin and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other four that you mentioned,
I've never heard of any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned one of them that can be
toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know for sure if it's toxic,
but I've heard a couple people mention
[SPEAKER_01]: that they think that might be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put words in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of unknowns here in this
industry and in this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in the dark for so long,
being a schedule one substance that people
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't allowed to do this research for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks to organizations like MAPS and
people like Rick Doblin, they've opened up
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability for us to start looking at
these things again, which actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happened way back in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other constituents, other than
psilocin and psilocybin, are those four
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we are trying to analyze and
get potency for because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage them because we think that they
are perhaps helper molecules for
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are the other four really more things
that we want to track for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: negative reasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for the norsilicin, beocysteine,
and norbeocysteine, I know that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely interested in them as
psychedelic molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe there's major toxicity
associated with those in larger doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more minor alkaloids in the
mushroom compared to psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocin, and they're not found in every
species either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely seen beocysteine and
norbeocysteine in some samples from
[SPEAKER_01]: customers, but I have yet to see
norsilicin show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these molecules convert into
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psilocybin converts into psilocin,
and all of these molecules are very
[SPEAKER_01]: similarly related structurally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me right away of the entourage
effect in cannabis.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm curious about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that, and again, I know we're
very early in this research, but do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think we're going to find that these
different constituents are working
[SPEAKER_00]: together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that they just happen to
sometimes co-occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be hard-pressed to believe that
they don't have some sort of synergy or
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction with each other, because you
can make the analogy to cannabis where you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at CBD and THC, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't bind to the same receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they have different effects in
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we know the target for psilocin
and psilocybin, we may not know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: target receptors for the other
constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might not even know if psilocin and
psilocybin touch other receptors either.
[SPEAKER_01]: The experiments that are done in order to
figure this stuff out are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And involve binding kinetics with the
analyte and the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a great deal of work to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also, when you have lower
affinity, or what I mean by that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction between the receptor and the
molecule is not very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those can be actually hard to discover
that they're binding to in the cell or on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes even more extensive work to
discover the minor receptors that they
[SPEAKER_01]: might interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know for me, the four that you
mentioned other than psilocin and
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin were all new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to people who are studying at your
level and understand these mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: intimately, are you expecting there to be
some or many more constituents of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms that we discover and find out
are things that we do want to analyze?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of things we were going to
be looking for in these assays is
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding as we learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some work going on in Israel
where they have a very advanced lab where
[SPEAKER_01]: they use a different technique than we use
in Flourish to look at these analytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with liquid chromatography coupled
with a mass spectrometer, you can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules that are super low abundance and
maybe a thousand fold more sensitive than
[SPEAKER_01]: the HPLC UV that I'm using to do these
quantitative analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that they've discovered a host
of new molecules in psilocybin mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in the literature and just really
isn't well known at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you need to do then is
single out these molecules and then do
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments with each of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very massive effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the biggest deficiencies I have
right now in this field is the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: dive really deep into the literature of
basic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my work right now is involved with
researching method development because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up additional tests outside of
psilocybin mushrooms, which we can talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about later if you're interested or maybe
next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of my time is spent developing
new tests for the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little bit deficient on the
newest alkaloids coming out of these
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, but that's actually something
we could probably talk about in a single
[SPEAKER_01]: episode if you're ever interested in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting to experience how
much opportunity that there is in
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody who sees themselves as an
organic chemist or a naturalist scientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea that there's all these species to
discover and then there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: species to then do experimentation within
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, how they're
interacting with the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a time to be somebody early career
who is interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, I have two answers to that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you said additional species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, I've been talking mostly
about the psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I thought was really
interesting, too, is I've even seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: reference where people have found
bufetinin in the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same one found in the toad,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really powerful DMT molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another reference I'd need to
follow up and verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought that was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for other species, there are like,
geminopolis and foliota.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these molecules called
bisnuragonin, hispidin, and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: aminida, there's muscimol, ibotenic ascid,
and muscozone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a host of other molecules that
can be looked into as well, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just narrowing down on the psilocybin
mushrooms is super interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's also a lot more out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, when we're talking about
the fungal kingdom, there is so much we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unbelievable amount of information
out there to be mined by people to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what's going on with these absolutely
incredible organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that the few labs that there are
for mushrooms in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look different and they're run
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to ask you like a real
general question from your experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of about all labs in general,
which is, do you think that mostly labs
[SPEAKER_00]: are being set up at this point just for
psilocybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that both part of their
business model, to be able to have a more
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of customers, but also the
direction that interest is going,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say that most labs are setting
themselves up for that aminida and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other mushrooms that are coming into
popularity again?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, most people are going
to be handcuffed by their laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only legal to mess with any of
these in very few places in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of Oregon, Denver, Oakland,
and maybe I have heard of a lab in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, but I don't know if they're just
doing it without having the laws changed
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and there's a couple levels of this
answer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to set up the testing for psilocybin
and psilocin, it's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's information out there in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a tremendous amount of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, 20, $30,000 investment
and you could get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now having the ability to do, you know,
analytical method development and develop
[SPEAKER_01]: methods for things that there might not be
a lot of information out there is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a real challenge for anyone that
doesn't have a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in chromatography method
development with HPLC or LCMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've noticed is several of the
labs that are up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, several, there's only a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people doing it are very young
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by young, I don't mean their
physiological age, but the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience they have with this type of
work and the less experience you have
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this, the more difficult it is to
expand into different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: species or different tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me, I've been doing chromatography
method development for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just recently announced that I can test
for cordyceps and I got some cordyceps
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms from a guy on Instagram,
you know, collaborated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me some material to help develop
my method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had this guy's mushroom and an
extract for, gosh, it must have been two
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just been so busy in my day job
and all the other things involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just didn't have time to get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just last weekend, you know,
I developed a method for cordyceps in two
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of people are not
going to have the base knowledge to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, validating the method
and making sure it's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes a lot more work after
you develop it to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we can have really
challenging issues where two different
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules have what's called the same
retention time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is when you have a
complex molecule, say I do an extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: of a mushroom and then I put it through my
machine, we use a column that is packed
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bed of what's called resin,
which is basically a bed of a bead that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a chemical functional group or a
chemistry interactive group on the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: of a molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take our complex mixture of mushrooms
and we pass it through that column and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecules in the mixture interact with
the surface of that column resin in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how they start to separate out and
resolve from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you put a sample on a column,
you can have stuff come out within a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple minutes, five, 10, 15, maybe even
20 minutes to even longer, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: how fast the flow is and how much
interaction occurs between the molecule of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest and the resin bed of the column.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these retention times is how you
distinguish which molecule is which,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you do everything the exact
same way every time, they should come out
[SPEAKER_01]: to the same retention time within 0.05
minutes of each other, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: within seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be very reproducible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we have two molecules that are
almost identical, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: silicin and psilocybin is a very subtle
change where psilocybin loses a phosphate
[SPEAKER_01]: group, which is a phosphorus and four
oxides and four oxygens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, you actually get a
pretty big change in the physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior or the chemical behavior of the
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get these to separate very
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with Cordyceps, you're actually
looking at molecules where it's a subtle
[SPEAKER_01]: of a change of a hydrogen and an OH group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a hydroxyl to a hydrogen and everything
else on the molecule is identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So separating those when there's such a
subtle change is critical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't want to tell people
you're testing Cordyceps, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that peak also has either
adenosine or two deoxy adenosine,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be giving them the wrong
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make sure that with your
method development that you have all your
[SPEAKER_01]: controls in place and all your standards
separating at what is called a baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: resolution so that you can actually
quantitate or give people the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of these analytes in their
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very clear explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about this before when I
was talking to Dr. Miyabi Shields on this
[SPEAKER_00]: show, but I really like, I don't know,
the artisan approach whereby by creating
[SPEAKER_00]: these lab processes, you're kind of
inventing your own tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandpa and my uncles, they were all
carpenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when I was a kid,
the first time that I read the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that they needed to do
something in carpentry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they actually developed and made a
tool because that tool didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that you could invent tools
was fascinating to me as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is cool to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially what you're
describing is that, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got this new box of information
called mushrooms and we need to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with tools to be able to open this box
uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get pretty jazzed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only really understood that there
have been terpenes in mushrooms for about
[SPEAKER_00]: three years after it came up unexpectedly
during an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since that time, I have been trying
to learn everything I can about mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be incredibly subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly don't play as big of a role
to humans as an aroma attractant as they
[SPEAKER_00]: do in our favorite plant, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of the mushroom research I'm
talking about is saying that these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are going to be a bigger deal
than we take them for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to hear what you have
to say about the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you testing for mushroom terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a few that are particularly
common?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your conversations with your
customers, do you have any status quo of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at as far as understanding the
role that terpenes play in these
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your last question is the easiest one to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the role that these terpenes are
playing, for the most part, we have no
[SPEAKER_01]: clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a brand new area of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there might be a couple labs
around the world that would disagree with
[SPEAKER_01]: me and say they know more and they
probably do, but these are kind of obscure
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't really know too much about
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not an expert in mushroom
terpenes because they're so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I'd like to say is they're
very different from the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, cannabinoid terpenes are
typically associated with odor and
[SPEAKER_01]: providing us with that beautiful profile
that we get from all the diversity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes found in mushrooms are
generally called triterpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're much larger and they're more
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often than the ones we know about in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do not have odors associated with
them because they're not as volatile if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're volatile at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're found in some species and not
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the reishi mushroom has a
large group of triterpenes that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: very interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are much more complicated to test
for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, first of all, getting standards for
them can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that are going to be looking
at terpenes are going to be using mass
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrometry, which these machines are
very expensive and Flourish is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: planning on buying one in the near future
so that I can expand into these more lower
[SPEAKER_01]: abundant molecules and ones that you might
not be able to find, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: authentic reference standards for because
using a mass spectrometer, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: always need a reference standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't need a reference standard
to identify things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these databases that you can pay
enormous amounts of money to have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can basically find just about any
molecule that we know exists that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use a mass spectrometer to
quantitate, then you definitely need
[SPEAKER_01]: reference standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I have a feeling that these
terpenes, these triterpenes from mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling that they're going to be
critical in the bioactivity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal properties of these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's also some found in
turkey tail and definitely in lion's mane
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these other mushrooms,
they also have these unique compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with them that aren't found in
other species like, you know, these
[SPEAKER_01]: arenasines and what's the name of the
other group of compound arenasines and
[SPEAKER_01]: hercinoids from lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these incredibly unique
diterpenoids from the mycelium of lion's
[SPEAKER_01]: mane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also ones in the mycelium,
I believe that's the arenasine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the hercinoids are more
abundant in the fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Paul Stamets has talked about these
quite a bit on various podcasts he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, these are responsible for
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know that I should say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a very strong hypothesis
that these things are helping,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in vivo, in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely in vitro work showing
that these lion's mane compounds actually
[SPEAKER_01]: initiate neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if Paul Stamets has also referred to
other work that shows when you combine
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin and lion's mane, neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also another thing that he's,
sorry, I just hit the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that he led onto on one of
the Joe Rogan podcast years ago is the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of these two molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add in niacin or vitamin B3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what niacin is a vasodilator and it
can dilate the very well dilates all blood
[SPEAKER_01]: vessels, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about where you need
these molecules to work, if someone is
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with neuropathy from diabetes or
from some, you know, traumatic injury and
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to get the psilocybin and the
lion's mane molecules to the absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: depths of the periphery of our circulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the capillaries, all the deep
parts of our brain, you know, like where
[SPEAKER_01]: the neurogenesis is needed, where the
neuro degradation has occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by combining all these together,
you're going to get a stronger response by
[SPEAKER_01]: the combination of the erinaceins and
carcinones with the psilocybin and then
[SPEAKER_01]: using something like niacin to push these
molecules to the absolute end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: circulatory system where they're most
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's just absolutely
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was actually, what actually
precipitated the beginning of Flourish
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs was I was thinking about making a
supplement with lion's mane and niacin and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, letting people get their
own psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then all these laws changed and I
thought about, you know, making this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a couple of friends say,
oh, I think you should make a testing lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I need to shout out both of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of really good friends,
one's been my friend since college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeffrey, thank you so much for pushing me
towards this lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another guy that he's worked with
and I've become friends with, a guy named
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank both of those guys a
lot because without them I probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I would have missed the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come at the mushroom from a
different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, before we do that, I wanted to just
jump on the niacin bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've talked about niacin and
microdosing on the show here a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times and you're the first person who
explained why niacin is in the stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really valuable insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually something really
interesting about that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Niacin, if you take too much, you can get
what's called a niacin flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not fun, not super dangerous,
but not fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the cool things about using
niacin in this context is you can prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: people from taking a whole bunch of,
not that you don't want to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin police, but you know,
by putting niacin in the microdose,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to take too many because
you're going to get a niacin flush way
[SPEAKER_01]: before you start tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to have a macrodose,
just, you know, grab five grams of some
[SPEAKER_01]: good mushrooms and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, so that once they are on store
shelves, it decreases the likelihood that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to take their whole
bottle of microdose at the same time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For jurisdictions that are worried about
this, you know, that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative, it might be a really good
thing because there are molecules you
[SPEAKER_01]: could add in there that will dilate your
blood vessels without the niacin flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some peptides and some other
molecules, small molecules that'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about adulterants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, most of us have got
cannabis analytics as our framework in our
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to like the cannabinoids
and the terpenes that we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also, especially in the licensed
system, looking at molds and heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: and like just, you know, chemicals from
like Eagle 20 and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mushrooms, mushrooms are not
grown the same way as plants, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from your perspective, what,
what substances might we be searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: in mushrooms in the lab that would suggest
that they were perhaps a grown incorrectly
[SPEAKER_00]: or in an unclean environment, which would
cause us to reject batches of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that would be,
but I'm assuming there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, yeah, I'm, I'm not a mushroom
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never have grown mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little bit uneducated here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing about mushrooms,
if you screw it up, my understanding is a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of times you don't get anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you get a contamination,
a lot of times the contamination will
[SPEAKER_01]: outrun the mushrooms that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically just have to throw it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm sure there are situations where
people are growing with maybe substrates
[SPEAKER_01]: that might have heavy metals in them or
substrates that might be contaminated with
[SPEAKER_01]: a some sort of organism that would be
unhealthy for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I absolutely plan on instituting
this type of testing at Flourish labs as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe when it comes time for the
regulated legal testing under 109,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will be looking for contaminants like
heavy metals and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria or other fungi that could be
dangerous to humans that might be slow
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll use a PCR genetic test to
determine these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really pretty straightforward,
not difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and going to be critical again,
because you're taking, you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: making a food, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a medicine for somebody that they're
going to ingest in their body and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's get back to the analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I understand that, you know,
one of the things that are interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about mushrooms is that not only do they
have, um, you know, common, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, common constituents that are just used
in and applied in novel ways in fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also there are some, um, constituents
that, that, um, uh, don't occur very often
[SPEAKER_00]: except in mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of, uh, labs that we're
almost familiar with, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using, uh, chemical standards for,
um, for these constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, you know, using the
technology compare against the standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to then figure out how much of it is
in any particular mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm guessing that since, um,
you know, the philosophy mushroom is still
[SPEAKER_00]: a schedule one at the federal level,
that some of these standards, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually be challenging to get your
hands on, but I'm willing to be open to
[SPEAKER_00]: the path to the fact that maybe they all
already exist and it's just been access to
[SPEAKER_00]: them for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so tell us a little bit about how
difficult standards are to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain to do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is one of the most common
questions I get from people and you'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's a philosophy here that is
pretty, um, straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these molecules, you, you have to take
a certain dose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to get the standards,
you contact these chemical companies and
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically have one milligram per
milliliter solutions that you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're DEA exempt because you're paying
anywhere from 70 to a few hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: for a single milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to be abusing these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're going to, you can go down
the street and find them for way cheaper,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're DEA exempt when it's a
milligram or less, and they're often in
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents you would never put in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's too much of a hassle to try to get
these and abuse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super expensive and no one would ever
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're DEA exempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you go try to buy five grams or
you try gram more than, or you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to buy a powder, then you need a
DEA license.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just for a single milligram,
uh, one meg per mill reference standards,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you need is a legitimate laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, by legitimate laboratory,
when you start a company like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you have a laboratory or you're
starting in a nonprofit or in a
[SPEAKER_01]: university, you know, the companies vet
your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't have a mail service.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have, you need a legitimate
commercial laboratory location for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: even send them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the, that's where the level of,
of, uh, sort of, uh, regulation comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: by the actual chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't just sell them to anybody also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, um, sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as we all know, um, people game the
system all the time in cannabis by,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, by which flowers they choose to send
to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe they're just sending colas or
maybe they'll roll the flower in key first
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, whatever they're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not a representative sample,
which scientifically is, is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quite, um, a process of having and having
and having, um, uh, a large lot all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down to a small lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but when you're done, mathematically
it's, it's representative of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it comes to mushrooms though,
um, uh, I don't know what a sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: process is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so does it matter which mushrooms you
pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can you game the system by,
by sending like a larger or a smaller one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, one of the most interesting things
about these mushrooms to me is the
[SPEAKER_01]: variability of the alkaloid content from
flush to flush, from mushroom to mushroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also within the mushrooms themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe it's going to be a lot harder
to adulter them than with cannabis for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get to that in a moment,
but I had a customer interested in looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the various structural aspects of the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the mushrooms are growing,
you know, the way that they grow the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cap and the stem appear fused for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some mushrooms have a veil,
which is like a little skirt around the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the cap that attaches to the,
the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that opens, then the,
uh, the spores are able to drop from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've been told by growers that,
and also seeing research in the literature
[SPEAKER_01]: where most likely the most potent time to
harvest is just before the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: caps open and the veils open, like,
so everything's closed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you look even more carefully,
I had a customer like section the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom, uh, from the step, the,
the bottom of the stem up to the tip of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cap, where we looked at the lower part
of the stem and we looked at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stem and the junction of the stem and
the cap right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it like, he took about, I don't know,
few, a half a centimeter to the right of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock side and about a half a
centimeter to the right of the left of
[SPEAKER_01]: the, of the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sliced that and then he took the
top of the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at that, that
centerpiece where the veil connected to
[SPEAKER_01]: the stock and the cap was by far the most
potent part of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like two fold more potent than the cap and
maybe like two and a half to three times
[SPEAKER_01]: more potent than the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really funny answer because
everybody argues about whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: stems or caps are, are the most potent,
but actually it's, it's, it's where they
[SPEAKER_00]: join.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in that instance, definitely,
because I've also seen, uh, just recently
[SPEAKER_01]: a guy on Instagram showed that the stock
was more potent than the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this opens up a whole host of
questions around mushroom cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've learned a ton about steering
plants to produce molecules, cannabis with
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or CBD, other plants, you know,
that like, uh, to produce compounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest for pharmaceutical or,
or industrial purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm really interested to see if we can
do this with fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once these growers get out of the
basements and closets and start making
[SPEAKER_01]: these commercial facilities and they're
able to control their environments with
[SPEAKER_01]: really high level, um, uh, man,
I'm missing a lot of words today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, you know, high fidelity control
of their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they can tune it up or down a
couple of degrees, a couple percent
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They control CO2 oxygen levels,
light dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the, when the mushroom growers get
these tools, are they going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce highly consistent badges?
[SPEAKER_01]: They might.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they might not also, because maybe
the mushrooms control this in a way we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did briefly read an abstract of a
paper last night where they claimed that
[SPEAKER_01]: they could influence the alkaloids in the
mushrooms by, uh, growth conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to take a massive effort
of research and development on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the mushroom grower part growers parts
to, you know, normalize cultivation so
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, people that are producing
products can grab a batch from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: grower every time and know more or less
that their product is going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, come out the way they expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good news for labs like
myself, because if they have a consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: batch every time, you don't necessarily
have to test every batch of raw material
[SPEAKER_01]: before you make a product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're varying more than 10% of
your raw material batches, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to test every batch so they know
how to make their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I would be able to be testing
pre-product formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would be testing their products
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, for the growers and the product,
uh, and the producers and people making
[SPEAKER_01]: product, I hope that they can,
uh, normalize the grow and get consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it will just help them save a lot of
money, you know, and the testing we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be required to test
everything before it hits the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there ever is retail or before it hits
the clinic before it's given to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our niche is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but we're definitely available to help
if that is the case where they need pre
[SPEAKER_01]: and post testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to
continue down the same, um, the same vein
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and talk about, um, uh, testing
mushrooms that have been dried or fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you are listening to Shaping Fire and
my guest today is biochemist, George
[SPEAKER_00]: Selhorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth, not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the market has diversified into
psilocybin and other plant medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light has been right there,
evolving with their diverse clients to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide legal expertise with a high level
of legal acumen, creative strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and precision that comes with an intimate
and specific understanding of both
[SPEAKER_00]: business law and plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the layered local and national
[SPEAKER_00]: drug laws on your own, you are at risk of
fumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit, or because you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner, or simply because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their
[SPEAKER_00]: work, and I know this from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is biochemist, George Selhorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about what is actually in mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, but specific philosophy that we
want to test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked a bunch about the
things that might be in mushrooms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, I mean, that we want to test for,
that we don't want to have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit more about the
mushroom itself and getting it prepped.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the analytics, do mushrooms always
have to be dried first to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we test them fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we only compare fresh tests
against fresh tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we compare fresh tests against dry
tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the water aspect doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we can absolutely test wet or dry
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry mushrooms are a little easier to
homogenize than a wet mushroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's totally possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we control for moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we do dry weights, dry weight
measurements in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if I were to get a dried
mushroom from a batch and a wet mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: from a batch, what I would do is
homogenize both individually, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh out a sample, and then you extract
it and you do the HPLC and you get your
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I always ask for a little bit
extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you need a portion of mushroom
to do the analytics on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need a portion of the mushroom to
dehydrate so you can get the true dry
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when I get a dried mushroom from a
customer, I will take a small bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I basically have a little
dehydrating oven that will completely dry
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use 104 degrees, so it's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter, right, because I'm
not actually testing the part that you
[SPEAKER_01]: dehydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull out a sample first to do the
testing so it doesn't get any heat
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, light or oxidative degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just at the end, all you do is a math
adjustment to adjust for the loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: water, just like in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter what the water
content is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can compare any mushroom as long as
you fully dehydrate a sample and calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: the dry weight percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, how much of a sample in dry
weight, because I'm figuring dry is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of what everybody's using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how big of a sample do you think a lab
is going to request most of the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, same thing in cannabis,
having a little bit extra is helpful,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if something comes up and goes
wrong and you have to retest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do samples volumes or sizes look
like for mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I prefer two grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two grams is plenty for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other labs ask for three,
four and five grams, which in my humble
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion is a little bit excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the way I do it is I get two grams
from a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, most people are fully
dehydrating these things themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say an average like, you know,
air dried mushroom has about 10% moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the ones that I'm getting from
people only have about 1% moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're fully dehydrated before I get
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually make a very small dry weight
adjustment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, two grams is plenty for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep one gram for the dehydration step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep one gram for analytics because
for the analytics, I use about 250 to 350
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives me at least two tests two
extractions that if I had to extract their
[SPEAKER_01]: sample twice, then I have plenty for the
extractions and plenty for the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges that was very common
with labs at the beginning of licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was testing edibles because it's
so much more difficult to target in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids when you've got, you know,
God knows what else is in this brownie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it uniquely more difficult to find
mushroom metabolites in chocolate or other
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles because, you know, chocolates and
honey and gummies seem to be the three
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that mushroom edibles are first
coming to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an interesting chemistry
problem here, and it's both in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and in mushroom stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real quickly on cannabis, we know that
the cannabinoids are fat soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hydrophobic molecules,
which is why it's really easy to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate bar with cannabis because it has
a bunch of fat in it, whereas it's way
[SPEAKER_01]: more difficult to make a consistent gummy
because you're putting a hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule into a water based product,
a gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we flip this when we go to the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy to make really consistent
gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the gummies that I've tested from
people have been really consistent and
[SPEAKER_01]: then flip that the chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're trying to put a water soluble
molecule into a fat soluble product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the consistency in the chocolate bar is
more challenging with an alkaloid than a
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I test for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have methods for edibles, extracts and
fruiting bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can do all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the only lab in the
country doing edibles, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen advertisements for anybody
else doing edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that certainly explains why I'm
seeing the growth in mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gummies and gelatin based stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, traditionally chocolates have
been incredibly popular, but if the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the, if the homogenization is a
problem, that's a, that's a big deal
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker as far as consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and as we all know, especially with a
psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and as we know, like during the
transition from, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heritage market to the medicinal
market, you know, the semi-legal medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: market, and then a licensed market in
cannabis that, you know, the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, uh, to go in that direction is for
consistency for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, we're, we're, we're climbing
that same mountain now with mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out what is the,
what's the best way to create repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: results for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because, you know, that, that's the,
that's the only reason for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my, or not legalization,
but licensing, because I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really believe that the state
should be involved with licensing or
[SPEAKER_00]: taxing this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like the idea of there being
consistency in the products, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the end, my number one priority
is, is patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that makes some sense why the
gummies are kind of everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's a downside to these
edible things too, like sugar is such a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge problem in this Western culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, everybody wants to put it in
this sweet candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it's not the best route for
medicine in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with, I'm with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've pushed, um, tinctures as
a, as a great primary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, with capsules,
you're kind of, uh, well for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, with cannabis, uh, capsules,
you're going to have a whole bunch that
[SPEAKER_00]: are exactly the same and there's no
variability from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, all these people are
eating all these 10 milligram cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's not necessarily great for
patients either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with mushrooms, it's great,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could make teas and beverages without
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could even make a concentrate into a
few milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can make like a shot size and
just boom right there, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so easy to get these
alkaloids into water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's actually a really
interesting, I'd like to add here,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, something that I've discovered over
the last six months since I started this
[SPEAKER_01]: company, um, a one milligram dose in a
gummy is not the same as a one milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: dose in a fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hypothesis, which is supported by
the types of molecules that make up the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal biomass, mushrooms are essentially
a time release pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not have enzymes in our gut to
digest chitin, which is the cell wall of
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the degradation that takes place
in the stomach, and the gut is through the
[SPEAKER_01]: acidity of our stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acid in our gut is going to break
the mushroom down slowly and slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: release the alkaloid content of the
mushroom over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you take a gummy and it has one
milligram in it because it's been tested
[SPEAKER_01]: and we know it has one milligram of
psilocin in it, or say 1.3 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin, because there's a conversion
factor there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel one milligram in a gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not feel one milligram in an
average potent mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes on a lot faster too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically getting all of the
alkaloid dissolving immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this full milligram going into
your bloodstream all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to hit your receptors and cause
an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying, excuse me,
what I'm saying is for people out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start getting a hold of gummies,
you know, go easy first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mileage may vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mileage may vary, take less than more
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's been lab tested, that'll give
you a really good metric for your dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with cannabis, that's been one
of the coolest things is people like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I know what one milligram,
five milligrams, 10 milligrams is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do to me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what's in that gummy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the actual gummy in the sugar itself,
but if what's in the gummy is not
[SPEAKER_00]: pulverized and powdered mushroom,
it means that there is an extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
First.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the result of that extraction is
what's going into the gelatin process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are using a hundred
percent ethanol or grain alcohol because
[SPEAKER_01]: for one, it's, uh, you know, you're
allowed to consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for number two, it's easy to evaporate
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, this is something I've actually
been helping a lot of people, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: with their product development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of doing consulting for
people, which I'm definitely open to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: if anybody's interested, but because I
have tons of extraction experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in cannabis and in mushrooms and in
plant material in general, because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done that my whole life in the lab and as
a, as a recreational cannabis user,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you can extract with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can extract with, uh, acidified water,
uh, you know, add citrus juice or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can extract with methanol,
ethanol, acetic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, you want to be able to,
obviously people don't use methanol when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing products, like you're making
anything to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use methanol in the lab because it's the
best one for extraction for, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: quantitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my biggest, I would say the best
solvent to use for extracting mushrooms is
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred percent ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grain alcohol, you don't want to use
lab a hundred percent ethanol because
[SPEAKER_01]: these are, uh, cut with really nasty
adulterants to remove the last bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Everclear is the best, uh, if you're at
home and you're not sure what to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the great thing about alcohol,
especially a hundred percent alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: is with very mild heat, you can boil that
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you have an ounce of, uh,
of mushroom material that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract as much as the psilocybin out as,
psilocin and psilocybin out as alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will do a mechanical extraction
either with you grind it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in a vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just shake it with a shaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a more powerful method or like
ultrasonication or some, some way to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the alkaloids out of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you filter your biomass out and you
have this liquid with your mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fortunately the alkaloids are pretty
good, well resistant to mild heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can add, you know, 80, 90,
100 degree Fahrenheit heat to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: to this alcohol extract and boil it off
until it's reduced to whatever volume you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would add a little bit of
water and then you boil off the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ethanol and you have all of your
alkaloids in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a clean extract,
no harmful compounds unless there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the mushrooms you didn't know
about, unless there's something in your
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent you didn't know about,
but that's the cleanest way to produce a
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also gives you control over
concentration as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, and if that's how
they are doing it often when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making these, these edibles, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that is a pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that a citizen scientist
or a home user would be able to do as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of why I said it,
because mostly what I think people are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is they're kind of a afraid to work
with solvents, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very understandable, but just pure grain
alcohol is totally safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people I believe are trying
to extract in water and they're unable to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach these higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other tricks you can do too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you have an ounce of mushrooms,
you extract into, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred milliliters of a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can filter that biomass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that sample that you have your
extract in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use a fresh mushroom batch to
re-extract, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the solvent has a certain capacity
to hold alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're never going to saturate that
solution with one extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another way you can increase the
concentration of your extraction by using
[SPEAKER_01]: the same solvent or water on fresh batches
of biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you combine that with the alcohol
thing, then you can achieve really high
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations and, you know, be able to
make gummies or any kind of product by
[SPEAKER_01]: just diluting a little bit of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same way that I get my cannabis
tinctures for myself for treating my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury up to the numbers that I want them
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to take like fricking
five, six, eight squirts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a, you know, not a single,
not a double, but a triple maceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So introduce the same ethanol to fresh
plant material three times and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what did you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carrying capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, it wasn't supposed to be a quiz,
but the total amount of cannabinoids the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol can hold, because that's where I
want it to be, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be at the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So- Yeah, the saturation point
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to take in any more
Everclear or, you know, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol is that I'm using for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, you know, especially,
you know, recovered alcoholics or people
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't consume alcohol, they don't
want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to have an alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily we can boil off the solvent
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I want to add to that real
quick is I've seen studies where people
[SPEAKER_01]: treat the psilocybin alkaloids up to 60
degrees Celsius, which is 140 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with, you know, relatively short
treatments, five, 10, 15, 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't get much degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you can heat these up to a
hundred degrees Fahrenheit and get almost
[SPEAKER_01]: no degradation if it's for a short time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also institute a rotovap,
which is a rotating evaporator we use in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab with mild heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, if you've got the
money to buy a rotovap, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will go even faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's tools out there to be able to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've already said that
you're not a mushroom cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not have anything to say about
this question, but people will indeed be
[SPEAKER_00]: curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have come across any ways that
cultivators can increase their potency in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in their growing bins,
perhaps from a conversation with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a client of yours or something,
you know, because people are always
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to increase potency and clearly,
you know, getting good, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics is, you know, probably the number
one thing, but do you have anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that comes to mind is I've
heard people talk about CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe CO2 levels are important for
triggering fruiting body formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would imagine that the air
composition, oxygen to CO2 ratio and
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature are probably super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this really interesting post last
night on Instagram that Paul Stamets put
[SPEAKER_01]: out and he was saying that the temperature
of the mushroom is cooler than its
[SPEAKER_01]: surroundings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has like this endothermic
behavior when the fruiting body is
[SPEAKER_01]: forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by endothermic, I mean, it actually
absorbs, is able to absorb heat because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cooler than its surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a heat sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an exothermic chemical reaction
produces heat and an endothermic reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: sucks heat out away from the reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, when you mix like
acetonitrile and water together,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the solvents I use in the lab for
analytics, it gets cold and you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: let it warm up to room temperature before
you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an endothermic reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this chemical reaction occurs and then
this mass now absorbs heat from the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment because the reaction like
costs that biomass heat or that mass,
[SPEAKER_01]: not biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so, you know, temperature,
CO2, oxygen are probably the first metrics
[SPEAKER_01]: I would look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that's a hypothesis based on
very limited information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I guess this is a little bit
of a fanboy question, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what varieties are you seeing consistently
getting high potency results?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, online, just from based on
people's talking, I think that most people
[SPEAKER_00]: would put, you know, whatever version of a
penis envy at the top of that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're, you know, you're in a unique
place because you're interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are growing a wide variety and
you're seeing the test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think I'll just stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most potent mushroom I've seen so far
is an ape, which I believe is a penis envy
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albino penis envy.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually seen some variability in
different apes, but the highest potency
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so far is 1.8% dry weight and
these beautiful apes that are just bluish
[SPEAKER_01]: and fat and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing I, I almost said
something earlier about people's visual
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal to mushrooms and comparing it to
how people just freak out about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know there's some mushroom geeks out
there that totally love just looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the different morphologies of these fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it super interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you can definitely see some
people thinking, Oh, cannabis flower is
[SPEAKER_01]: way more beautiful than a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I think that's in the eye of the
beholder, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I see when I look at these,
these amazing natural organisms that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, I see chemistry factories,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these, this unbelievable ability to
produce these chemicals that nature is
[SPEAKER_01]: providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so interesting, too, if you think
about why plants are chemical factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pretty simple answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't run away from their predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to defend themselves
chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plants have been in plant and
fungi have been on this planet for so
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had plenty of time to evolve
mechanisms for defense, which are super
[SPEAKER_01]: broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also had time to evolve molecules
that affect organisms in other ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what we get to benefit from,
which is I find absolutely fascinating
[SPEAKER_01]: that these completely different organisms
produce molecules that affect our brain
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to talk
about how the the new existing existence
[SPEAKER_00]: of mushroom analytics is actually changing
mushroom pricing in the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take this short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is biochemist George
Selhorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plants life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dinomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dinomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's d-y-n-o-m-y-c-o.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dinomyco on Amazon or dinomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: by using the discount code shapingfire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dinomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: For decades, Americans have enjoyed
cannabis flowers in joints and bongs and
[SPEAKER_00]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, with the normalization of
cannabis use increasing across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, we have the opportunity to enjoy
smoking cannabis luxuries that simply were
[SPEAKER_00]: not attainable before.
[SPEAKER_00]: North Coast, hand rolls, blunts,
cannons, rosin-infused donuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and canigars available in the state of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: North Coast focuses on flavor over
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing their own flower,
North Coast goes out into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: community and creates relationships with
the best growers working with the best new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis varieties available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely, heavy THC is a factor,
but North Coast focuses on aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity, complex terpene profiles,
and taste that continues throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The North Coast team curates flowers like
others curate art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seek out the best talent,
build relationships, helps them take their
[SPEAKER_00]: product to the highest levels,
and then buys their well-cured flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to hand roll them just for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like their hand-blown glass tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And North Coast has branched out beyond
canigars into rosin-solventless THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds and exceptional hash rosin cards
for on-the-go cannabis connoisseurs,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: North Coast provides you with attainable
luxury, offering you an ultra-premium
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking experience at a price that seems
reasonable and repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find out more about North Coast's line
of cannabis products, visit their
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram at northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when in Michigan, ask for North Coast
at your favorite shop, North Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_00]: Sigmund's lecture, Understanding Your
Endocannabinoid System, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland Nursery, talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy Canole's Lost Art of the Hashishin
presentation, Nicholas Mahmoud on
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative and polyculture cannabis
growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business, even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to youtube.com forward slash Shango
Los or click on the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh Rutherford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is biochemist George Selhorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the interesting, I guess,
impacts from the recent existence of
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom labs is how it is impacting price
in the, I guess, both the underground
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom market and also in the just
blossoming soon-to-be-licensed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: because up until labs existed,
a psilocybin mushroom was a psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were generally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some had their, people had their
preferences because maybe they had a good
[SPEAKER_00]: trip on it one time or they liked how they
looked more, and then people would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, these tend to be stronger than
these other ones, but it was really just
[SPEAKER_00]: conjecture and very anecdotal on,
and each person had their own opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was no way to compare and
contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aha, enter mushroom labs now, and so now
we actually know what's in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's this new variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until now, it was people's preference,
and maybe the mushroom had something
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable about it, like it was albino or
leucistic or, oh, cool, it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: penises, which is kind of a novel,
cool thing too, so people were making
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions on aesthetic choices,
but now you can put them in a lab and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, this black cap albino penis
envy is the most potent thing that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten tested versus this Brazilian which
is beautiful and easy to grow and has
[SPEAKER_00]: these other attributes that we're
attracted to, but it's only 0.7%,
[SPEAKER_00]: not 0.7%, it's only 70% as potent as the
ape, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made that number up, but just for
the example, and so that is now impacting
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing at the street and manufacturing
level because people are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: charge more for ultra potent mushrooms
like these apes, and that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your experience behind the scenes
with your customers because it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a bit like cannabis where the higher
the THC, the more likely it is to be sold,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the potency of mushrooms is now
becoming related to the price as well from
[SPEAKER_00]: both people who are taking it for a
spiritual experience and for people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are planning on doing an extraction and
putting them into a bunch of gummies or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, I didn't even know that was
happening, to be honest, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're in the lab, yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people pay me to take their
mushrooms and test them, so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually fascinating, and it makes sense,
actually, because at least with mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can touch on the cannabis stuff,
I have a pretty strong opinion about that
[SPEAKER_01]: one if you want to hear it, but with
mushrooms, I've tested stuff as low as
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.2% all the way to 1.8%, so that's
nine-fold difference in potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you go to a bar and you want to buy
a Budweiser, that's whatever, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, 1.5%, whatever the percent of a
Budweiser is, you're going to pay a low
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of money, and then say there's some
8.5% Belgian, you're probably going to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: more for that beer, because alcohol is,
we know what it does, it has a linear
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, you drink more, you get more
drunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With mushroom alkaloids, you take more,
you have a more interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is linear, the more you take,
the higher you get, so it makes sense in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mushroom world, and the only problem
there is are people going to be saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this is an ape when it's really a way
less potent mushroom, so ask for the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: test if they're charging you based on
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting how suddenly COAs are
very relevant in mushrooms now,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've had people requesting them be
made, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's interesting,
there are arbitrage opportunities as well
[SPEAKER_00]: in this, because if you are manufacturing,
you may not necessarily choose an ape
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom, because they are at the,
you know, even though the potency is the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest, 100%, it is also the highest
price, and so there would be good
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments to be made that, you know,
you're looking for, in a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you may be looking for a
balance between, you know, what mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: has got the right balance of potency,
availability, easiness to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then easiness to, you know,
break down and use, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, you're 100%, right, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, most potent mushrooms is
not necessarily going to be best mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: for manufacturing, and these realizations
are just coming to the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really interesting to watch them
sort themselves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I totally agree, because if
you're running a business, it's all about
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how much does it cost me to do this,
and how much do I get back, and how much
[SPEAKER_01]: product can I make from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could very easily see a scenario
where there's a 1% mushroom, it grows
[SPEAKER_01]: fast, it's really easy to grow,
like you say, it's, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it grows twice as fast as a mushroom
that's 1.5%, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be better to grow the 1%,
you get more biomass, and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction efficiency is better with the
slightly lower potent mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's gonna be,
everybody's process is gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: worked out in that manner, and that's what
I would suggest people do is just don't go
[SPEAKER_01]: right off the bat and buy the most
expensive potent mushroom, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a couple different potency batches,
see how much it costs you to make your
[SPEAKER_01]: product, and then, you know, make the
correct decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier in the second set, we were
talking about what part of the mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be the most potent, and you told
me about the single test case you have
[SPEAKER_00]: done where it was actually very,
the junction of the stem to the cap that
[SPEAKER_00]: tested highest, which was a really
interesting insight, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as we worked our way out of the
question, you know, I just mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: people argue quite a bit online about
whether or not it's the cap or the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you said, yeah, there's a lot of
variability, and we moved on, but I wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to that, because, you know,
you are the chemist, and you are the
[SPEAKER_00]: person who is, you know, doing these
tests, and granted, most of your tests are
[SPEAKER_00]: on homogenized mushroom, right,
so the cap and the stem are all mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: together, but I'm thinking that you have
something to say, even if it is there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and fast rule, I just wanna get your
thoughts on stem versus cap potency
[SPEAKER_00]: generally across all philosophy mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a difficult question to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would feel comfortable if I
tested at least 10 different mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at caps and stems and stuff,
but I've only done it once, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like an N of one is a classic example of
not enough data to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's, over the years,
people have looked at this in different
[SPEAKER_01]: academic groups or different parts of the
world where they're allowed to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: work, and in general, the theme is that
the caps are more potent, so I would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably lean to that being true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always exceptions to rules,
like where we saw the guy have a more
[SPEAKER_01]: potent stem the other day, but in general,
I would say the caps probably do have more
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaloid than the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if there was a fully mature
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on it, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rule of thumb would be cap,
but we know the variability between
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties is so significant that,
you know, don't prefer to put too much
[SPEAKER_00]: weight on the rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing to do is just grind it all
up, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, grind everything you have into a
single powder, and then it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had another customer where he
took like a pound and ground the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing up, and then he sampled it three
different areas and called that A,
[SPEAKER_01]: B, and C, and then he did that for four
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every month he did a sampling like A,
B, C, right, and so he was looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation over time and consistency of
sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found some really cool stuff,
like the sampling and the consistency was
[SPEAKER_01]: highly, everything was really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every test I did was right around six
milligrams per gram, so 0.6%, and over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, he barely lost anything,
so he had a really good storage condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for consistency,
homogenize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when it comes up most of the
time is when there is a sale taking place,
[SPEAKER_00]: because so often a purchaser, whether or
not it is somebody who is trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a business in Oregon,
or if it's in like the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood market, you know,
there's always, people want the caps
[SPEAKER_00]: because they look cool and they're kind of
like ceremonially dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so often, if you're the last person to
buy mushrooms from your connection,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be a lot of stems in the
bottom, so you might end up with mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: stems and a few caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we don't really know
does help the position of the seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's when it usually comes
up, because anybody who's growing their
[SPEAKER_00]: own and it's not changing hands,
we're just gonna homogenize it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be either in a licensed
market or about to be licensed market,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is a professional cultivator
selling to a professional manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or when you're just getting mushrooms from
your homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit on the storage of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, because the answer to how best to
store your mushrooms has really evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, and very much so over the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was in college back in the
early 90s, we were told to put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: Ziploc and put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed to work, but I'm
understanding now that there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing this research now,
and it's evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell us a little bit
about the varieties of storing our
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, and how we can get the most
longevity about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably in your answer, include a
little bit about what causes mushrooms to
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so remarkably, the best way to store
mushrooms is in the dark, sealed in a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: at about 60 to 65 degrees, and moderate
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people do freeze thaw studies,
like you said in the freezer, put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the refrigerator, and store them just at
room temperature, which would be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit warmer than 60, 65, 70, 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much the best way to do it to
maintain alkaloid levels is cool and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the dark, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to remove as much oxygen as
possible?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a vacuum sealer or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good move then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the primary issue is oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take away the oxygen,
then you're going to have way less
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for your mushrooms to degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light and heat and oxygen are your enemies
when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oxygen is the molecule that does the
damage, but light and heat will speed it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why the freezer doesn't
work all that great is when you freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: thaw biomass, whether it be tissue from an
animal, plant, bacteria, fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you freeze thaw, something,
you cause some of the cells to lice or
[SPEAKER_01]: burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, you're going to
expose the contents to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that freeze thaw in and out of the
freezer, every time you do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to burst some of the cells,
and then that's going to lead to the
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the refrigerator, it's probably a
moisture thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moisture also could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't fully dry your mushroom,
you put it in the fridge, the change in
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is going to cause
condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the biomass absorbs any of that water,
it will facilitate degradation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you keep them in a nice,
consistent, dry, dark environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be the best way to preserve
your mushroom potency over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you suggested keeping them in a low 60s
dark spot in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that bag, because you may
have just kind of said that generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference of an opinion between
a paper bag, because some people say they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to breathe, but I think that's just
the opposite because of the oxidation
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other people who talk
about either using plastic, or because
[SPEAKER_00]: most plastic, that's not a vacuum seal
breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are suggesting glass jars are
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the vessel that you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you want to be really anal
about it and give yourself little to note
[SPEAKER_01]: the best opportunity to preserve your
material, the glass jar that seals would
[SPEAKER_01]: be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you want to go even a step
further, you can take in an inert gas like
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen or argon and blanket the vessel
with that, and it pushes out all the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going a little far and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most home people aren't going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the laboratory or in a business,
you absolutely would want to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll get much longer shelf life
if you purge the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to do that cheap at home without
adding an inert gas is for these food
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh vacuum packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got these mason jar lid adapters,
which is what I use for my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know the stuff that I'm going to
smoke soon, and then I know the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just taken out of cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to sit there until I
get to it in two or three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I put it in a large mouth mason
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I paid like 20 bucks for this
adapter and it sucks all of the air about
[SPEAKER_00]: it out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would think that that would also
be a win for when I have mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% and filling up the vessel with as
much material as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no room for air, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the way you would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're covering all your bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about time for degradation
for the most common way of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms versus the crazy way that we
just described for perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people, they're going to get their
mushrooms in a Ziploc and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's not use freezer or refrigerator
because we've already suggested that no
[SPEAKER_00]: one should be doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to keep it in a cool,
dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put it under the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dark, it's cool, and it's in a
Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say that the mushrooms,
when you receive them, let's say that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were harvested two weeks ago and they were
dried properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a very short supply chain
between the cultivator and me as the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that scenario, how quickly are my
mushrooms under the bed going to degrade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking, we have a nice cool,
it's like a 60, 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the temperature's right and it's
dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you an example that was not
perfectly stored, but when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up the lab here and doing my R&D
and getting my methods started,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a grower friend give me a nice bag
of homogenized material so that I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: good amount of material to go back and
check so I could work on consistency,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to make sure I was getting accurate
results over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I had that material and I did all my
initial development about last December,
[SPEAKER_01]: January is when I did that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I tested that stuff about a month
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was about six months where it sat
probably closer to 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just in a plastic bag in my closet in
my bedroom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went from about 0.7% to about
0.56%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me really quick, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a, yeah, that's about 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a 20% loss in six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's actually way better than I
thought it was gonna be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was elevated temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you keep it at 60 degrees,
and that probably could have warmed up in
[SPEAKER_01]: there above that if it got warm,
like a couple few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been warm recently, so it could have
accelerated a little bit towards the end
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that guy that I did the study with,
over four months, I think the potency
[SPEAKER_01]: changed by like 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends who's a colleague of
mine, he's an ice cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very concerned about this last year
during the Pacific Northwest Heat Dome
[SPEAKER_00]: when it got to like 114 where he lives in
Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, other people he knew were
going to get ice in order to keep food or
[SPEAKER_00]: their pets or whatever, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of, how a double boiler you've
got the heat source on the bottom and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a secondary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually taking all his storage of
dried mushrooms and putting them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum packed bag and then put it in a
cooler that had all ice in the bottom but
[SPEAKER_00]: then was sealed and then was on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I don't know what the
science says about how quickly these are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lessen potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, but I want it to be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's like, I may be sweating my ass
off during the heat dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, but my mushrooms won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was a pretty novel
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty clever approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what he did was smart because it
allows him to put his mushrooms in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: above the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if he would have laid it directly
on the ice, that super cold temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: probably would have caused some
condensation to form inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like he just made a little
bit of air conditioning for his mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he describes it as a double boiler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's a radically different
application of that idea, I totally got
[SPEAKER_00]: what he meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's brilliant.
Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's letting the ice at the bottom cool
the chamber above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to drop it down to the
ice temperature, but it's going to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: much cooler than ambient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, since we're talking
about mushroom analytics labs and
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily shaping fire talks about
entheogens and evolution of mind and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other mushrooms that people
are all hot about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally put in a Chinese medicinal
groups like reishi and turkey tail and
[SPEAKER_00]: lion's mane and all these other mushrooms
that sometimes we use in cooperation with
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy mushrooms for this ailment or
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also just taking them for general
health seems to be pretty appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the
awarenesses that you have testing these
[SPEAKER_00]: other mushrooms as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that you don't just test
philosophy since you've talked about these
[SPEAKER_00]: other mushrooms and you have such intimate
details with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that there's people who are
formulating a lion's mane extract or
[SPEAKER_00]: something who's coming to you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as variability in the potency of
these mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unless they're really degraded,
they all look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no real way for us as a
consumer to know whether or not this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular lion's mane product is as
strong as this other one as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the direction that we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got the cordyceps testing set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the testing for a lot of these
other mushrooms is a lot more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can use the HPLC UV,
but for most of these, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need a mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are exceedingly expensive,
over $100,000 for the right machine to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I plan on going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to turn this business into a fully
functional mushroom lab, not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been approached by customers for
things like mescaline, DMT, ayahuasca,
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are asking me about testing for all
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the long run, I would like to be
able to test for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the coolest thing about being in
Oregon is with the decriminalization laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can test these as long as we have small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually gives you an advantage of
being in Oregon that the other
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions that only legalize
psilocybin, they're not going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even though cannabis is not
normalized yet, especially at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, all these other entheogens that we
love and humans have been using forever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're coming in the door right behind
cannabis in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going to be politically and legally
messy for a while, but everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that the doors are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's cracked open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snowball's rolling downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to ask you a question about
fruiting body versus mycelium potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is probably one of the most
asked questions I'm asked when talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: folks about Chinese mushrooms and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who fall on the it's okay
to put mycelium in the caps in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that Stamets does.
[SPEAKER_00]: For his products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are people who believe that
mycelium based medicine is snake oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually only the fruiting bodies
that should be used in kind of more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: real mushrooms company kind of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone's opinion really tends to fall
on the fact of what their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're an analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so I wanted to hear what your
thoughts are about whether or not we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be buying products that are made
from a fruiting body or from mycelium when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about non psilocybe
medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the point where opinions don't
count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have data showing that there's
molecules present in a certain part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass, I don't care what someone's
opinion is, if if we know that lion's mane
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium makes her son known a or air and
a scene a and the fruiting body doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can go eating the fruiting body
all day and you're not going to be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the air and a scenes, you'll get the her
son owns, which I believe that's correct
[SPEAKER_01]: that the air and a scenes are typically
found in the mycelium and the her son owns
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had that switched, I apologize to
everybody who knows that off the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it you know, this is where the science
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a good lab, a good scientist that
that knows how to do all the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: properly and has the proper controls and
the proper identification of these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even start looking at this on
a genetic level to you could start looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for gene expression in the mycelium versus
the fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another layer of evidence that
it's being produced, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find the gene in both the
fruiting body and the mycelium because the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene, the DNA is consistent from doesn't
matter the structure of the mushroom or
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the turning on of that gene does
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways that we can look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously, if the molecule is
present, and so for example, we grow some
[SPEAKER_01]: lion's mane mycelium, and we have a
boatload of biomass and we pull that out,
[SPEAKER_01]: we extract it and we identify her son own
a using mass spectrometry, it's there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then you go and you have the
fruiting body of lion's mane, you grind
[SPEAKER_01]: that up, you do your analytics,
maybe the maybe air and a scene isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I'm saying is there's different
molecules made in mycelium and fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies for different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard Paul Stamets say this ad
nauseum, but some people just don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you don't want to follow the
data and the science, that's your right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to be correct in terms
of what the contents are of those
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions or those bio masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also one of the reasons why
we need to make this information more
[SPEAKER_00]: available to people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think that anybody Well,
we're very few people are intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: making decisions that are anti science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that most people just would never
know where to find the data that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about of people testing mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium versus fruiting body,
this information is just hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be a scientist, you need to be
able to go on to PubMed and not just find
[SPEAKER_01]: articles that fit what you're looking for,
but be able to go into the article and
[SPEAKER_01]: read it from a critics perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, because every time a
scientist reads a scientific paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting that data to the test,
you're saying, does the data that people
[SPEAKER_01]: have presented in this paper convince me
of what they're trying to convince me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you'll have a scientist
read a paper and be like, I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That data is not convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what they did here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to, they're changing their
axes to get you to think there's a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of subtle things
scientists can do to trick a non expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's dangerous for like your
average person to go into PubMed,
[SPEAKER_01]: read a science paper and be like,
Oh, this is what this means.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's dangerous to do
that because a lot of times unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are plenty of scientists out there
that have an agenda and they're being paid
[SPEAKER_01]: by a company to get a certain answer and
they'll do everything they can to support
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, look at the food industry for
goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, we run into that in cannabis
all the time because people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are reading these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though, and certainly people are
fudging with their graphs, but at the most
[SPEAKER_00]: basic level, you know, you really have to
study whether or not they used,
[SPEAKER_00]: they used isolate or a whole plant resin
in the patient study because they act
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just say, you know, Oh,
we use 200 milligrams of CBD for this
[SPEAKER_00]: lupus patient because 200 milligrams of
isolate is different than 200 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD in, you know, a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, there's reasons for there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's reasons to use either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, even though I'm a whole
plant guy, I'm not trying to dis the
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to know what your goal is
and understand what, what was done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a really good example for that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with CBD isolate versus a CBD
extract, you know, children with Dravet
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome, they need CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the CBD is what actually helps
the seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't need that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus when you have all that other
stuff in there, you might have to give the
[SPEAKER_01]: kid a little bit of THC, which you might
not want to do to a five year old or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's absolutely applications for
isolates versus crudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're going at something
like a cancer or multiple sclerosis or
[SPEAKER_01]: some inflammatory thing, you don't want
isolate because all those other things in
[SPEAKER_01]: there are going to have different effects
and synergize and attack the broad
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms that someone that has cancer or
MS or something like that, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: something very specific, like a Dravet
syndrome, which is a very specific kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we transfer this to the mushroom
world and I guarantee there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments that, well, for example,
depression, psilocybin, pure psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated in the lab, even maybe
synthesized and used as a medicine for
[SPEAKER_01]: depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like you don't need like a
whole mushroom extract to pull that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there's definitely going to be
something out there where we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier with the five or six different
alkaloids we're finding in psilocybin that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, measurable by UV,
HPLC UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a different proportion of those
might have a better effect on PTSD than
[SPEAKER_01]: depression or a better effect on any of
these other ailments that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic mushrooms being effective on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get an even better result by
changing the ratio of beyocysteine to
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking forward to us,
you know, actually having the research
[SPEAKER_00]: behind these other components of the
mushroom so that we can start even having
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole mushroom conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at this point, you know,
anybody who says that they know is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, blow and smoke because the
research isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I respect smart people's hunches,
but we're only in the early days of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning what's in the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to say that we know all the
ramifications is just unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hunches and hypotheses put us on a
road to discovery, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of like the same thing
we're going through with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all started with bro science and now we
have to individually replace what we think
[SPEAKER_00]: we know with new things as the,
as the research, you know, it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So George, thank you so much for sharing
your unique expertise, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, with there only being three,
you know, municipalities or not
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities, but three, three
jurisdictions in the country that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, it's, it's, it's legal ish
to do what you do at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the state level, but it, you know,
it's still a schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got perspective and experience
that is, you know, just exceedingly
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it took me a while to find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it took you a while to be
comfortable, to, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be a little more public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I appreciate you choosing to share
your knowledge with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I wish you the best of luck on,
on, on this research and the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your applications, uh, however you use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for being on shaping
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been super incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the first time I've ever done
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it was, uh, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some closing thoughts there for a
second, but they may have just escaped me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, other than, oh yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real briefly, I could just kind of give
a brief history of, of my interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started my psychedelic journey
pretty young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took LSD for the first time at 15 years
old and got very heavily into it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years, which had an enormous
impact on my life for the better actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my, my, my younger days were
pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I grew up a skateboarder,
uh, with a single parent that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: business owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of freedom and I got
into a lot of things young and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I was going down a track that probably
wouldn't have been really beneficial to my
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after experiencing psychedelics,
mostly LSD, and then a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms towards the end there,
by the time I was finishing high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: it completely changed me and put me on the
academic track.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I found some better people to be
friends with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this amazing young lady that I
started dating and we were together for 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years and she helped steer me in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up going to college, going to
graduate school, getting a PhD and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really strongly believe that the
combination of, uh, cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics helped put me where I am
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I've been involved with this
counterculture for my whole life since I
[SPEAKER_01]: was about 15 and I'm 45 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for 30 years I've been involved at the
edge of counterculture as a skateboarder,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a, you know, cannabis person and,
um, very, very bullish on the ability of
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics to do positive things to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're finally here all these years
later where we're given the tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to get the education and now I
can be put in the position to help a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of people, um, you know, overcome
challenges that might provide them with a
[SPEAKER_01]: better life down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of, uh, why I'm here,
how I got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really appreciate the
opportunity to share, uh, what I know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the mushrooms and the analytics and
the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to see where all
this goes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much, George.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to follow along with
George, uh, and his research, there is but
[SPEAKER_00]: one place to go and that is the flourish
labs, uh, Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's at flourishfl.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: L O U R I S H and then underscore labs,
L A B S underscore Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you happen to live in Oregon and you
are looking for analytics, you can reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out to George that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if like me, you've got no need for
analytics, but you're very interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in keeping up with the science and his
research that there's the place to go.
