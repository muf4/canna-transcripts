[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, you are a pretty famous
proponent of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: using the entirety of the cannabis plant
together because all of the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD, all the what we call minor
cannabinoids, the terpenes, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: parts, they kind of play together with our
endocannabinoid system or body as a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a lock and key to kind of
open up different forms of healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in popular press, and where most of
the studies that we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're mostly on THC, CBD, the acid forms
of those, CBG, and some of the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: are cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm curious what you think we may find
with some of the things that we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing about and may or may not be
researched yet, like the flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the esters, and secondary metabolites that
are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think that we're going to
find when we start studying those
[SPEAKER_01]: focusedly instead of just terpenes
generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of potential for other
parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the leaves, there's an agent called
canaprine, which has a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been virtually no work done on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another agent, flavone, from cannabis is
called canflavin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a very powerful
anti-inflammatory without the side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
that quite frequently can produce ulcers,
[SPEAKER_00]: even heart attacks or strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, canflavin A has an
anti-inflammatory profile where these side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects would not occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that is worth looking
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we've got a totally
different set of agents from cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, which historically have been used
for some of the same things as the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including as anti-inflammatories and in
treatment of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the roots contain small
amounts of triterpenoids, which have very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting effects in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even some alkaloids, which they always
looked for in the tops but never found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to be learned yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know enough yet about even how to
use these that it would justify processing
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts of the plant other than the
flowers just to get some of these even
[SPEAKER_01]: though we don't know exactly what they're
doing yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of months ago I was in Chile in
Valparaiso on the coast and there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: man there selling various cannabis
preparations on the street and one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: was a salve that he made out of cannabis
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of artisanal products
that are employing these other parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are claiming good efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have, again, controlled clinical
trials, but hopefully that will come and
[SPEAKER_00]: give us the answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting too because you've said
before that people who are processing
[SPEAKER_01]: their sun leaves for CBD are going to be
disappointed because in the exterior sun
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves where trichomes are not made,
they're not going to find CBD there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tell people, if you want to still
use your sun leaves, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're essentially making yourself
wheatgrass shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting some with chlorophyll and
aminos and good things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this actually is a whole nother level
of justification for that because while we
[SPEAKER_01]: may not know exactly what they're doing to
us, in those dosages and with a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've carried around for us for so many
thousands of years, chances are it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not likely to produce damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are juicing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In large amounts, because of the magnesium
load from the chlorophyll, they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal cramping and diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I wouldn't expect any
major harms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in the specialty
chemicals that you can find in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis root ball, we actually did a
podcast on that a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find a link for that in the
first comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
