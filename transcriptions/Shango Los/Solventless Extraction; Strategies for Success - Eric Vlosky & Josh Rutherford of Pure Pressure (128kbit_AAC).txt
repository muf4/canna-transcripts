[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go now for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome everybody to the 130
presentation, solving list extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already done so,
please silence your cell phones so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not hearing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Shago Lose, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to check out the show at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an extraordinary YouTube
channel with over 150 speaker videos I've
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded at events just like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Eric Vlosky, one of our speakers,
already appears on the channel teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: about Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh Rutherford is one of the founders of
PurePressure, as well as owner of Cush
[SPEAKER_01]: Masters, an award-winning processing lab
based in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Vlosky is director of marketing for
PurePressure, and the two of them operate
[SPEAKER_01]: PurePressure, the industry-leading
solvent-less equipment supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please welcome Josh and Eric.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a really good seminar here to
empower anyone, either if you have an
[SPEAKER_05]: existing business that's running
solvent-less and you're looking for tips
[SPEAKER_05]: and tricks on how to make it better,
or if it's a form of extraction that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're looking to get into, either as a
complete net new or as one that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be adding on to an existing
operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the whole point of this presentation is
to give people advice, tips, and
[SPEAKER_05]: strategies so that you can be successful
with solvent-less.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the extraction forms that
needs the most education, and that's what
[SPEAKER_05]: we're here for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Josh and I will be tag-teaming these
topics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a lot of great ideas to share
with you guys, and we're going to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through this presentation in a cadence
kind of leading you through how to really
[SPEAKER_05]: think about being successful with
solvent-less processing, because there are
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of elements to it that if you're not
really orienting your business in the
[SPEAKER_05]: right way, you can make some missteps,
you can stumble, and it'll make it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little more difficult for you to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're here to help anyone who's trying
to do solvent-less do it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first big point is in today's
market with concentrates, if you are not
[SPEAKER_05]: making solvent-less concentrates,
you do not have a premium extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of our customers, solvent-less
might be 5% of their business,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of our customers it's 100% of their
business, but if you are trying to make
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates, solvent-less is the way that
you attract influencers and connoisseurs,
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's really the product category
that that specific segment of the market
[SPEAKER_05]: is looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we go to tons of trade shows,
we talk to business owners, I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: business owners of CO2 companies,
hydrocarbon companies, those guys that are
[SPEAKER_05]: owning and running those companies are
smoking grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they tell us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the clean concentrate as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solvent-less concentrates is also
fetching the highest dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a variation of SKUs that you're
able to create with rosin, with bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: hash, and really escalate what you guys
are doing, whether it's an existing lab or
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to start just a solvent-less lab or
having a solvent and solvent-less lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really, really important to be
able to have, and we'll get into this a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit later, is a variation of SKUs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And solvent-less can bring you that,
and it's definitely one of the cleanest
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate forms that I enjoy smoking the
most.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so another quick note here is that
many of our customers are doing all kinds
[SPEAKER_05]: of forms of extraction, and most labs
should be, so that is the perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anybody checks out MJ Biz,
they put out a fact book every year,
[SPEAKER_05]: they update it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not affiliated with them in any
way, I am not a salesperson for MJ Biz,
[SPEAKER_05]: but their fact book provides some of the
best data in the industry, and if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: serious about learning where trends are,
totally recommend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where this slide's coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the resolution isn't very good,
but what this very complicated set of bars
[SPEAKER_05]: and numbers is trying to tell us is that
the profitability of processing operations
[SPEAKER_05]: increases dramatically when you're making
a number of SKUs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for processing operations that are
making one to three different products,
[SPEAKER_05]: only six of them are reporting that
they're profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very, very little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you get into four to six, 20%,
but then once you get to that bottom,
[SPEAKER_05]: what that's really saying is that
processing labs that are making between 11
[SPEAKER_05]: and 15 unique SKUs, unique products,
83% of them are reporting profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a massive gulf in the difference
of how many products these labs are making
[SPEAKER_05]: and their profitability as a result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the reason you kind of see that
trend in the industry is because we're in
[SPEAKER_03]: a limited market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever you're opening up, whether it's
Colorado, whether it's Illinois or
[SPEAKER_03]: California, there's only so many
dispensary licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to capture more SKUs,
more volume with each of those stores and
[SPEAKER_03]: have a bigger presence in those stores is
very important in order to be the most
[SPEAKER_03]: successful with your solventless business
or solvent business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, solventless is the
least expensive way to add additional
[SPEAKER_05]: SKUs.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you compare cost for the equipment,
for everything that you need to go in on
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually release a number of
solventless SKUs, solventless tends to be
[SPEAKER_05]: the least expensive of all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the easiest way, the cheapest way
to add additional SKUs to your product mix
[SPEAKER_05]: if you aren't already doing so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's all about the post process,
the post process that you're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: using to make those SKUs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's going to be topicals,
edibles, carts, raws and batter,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a bunch of different jams and
micro diamonds and all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one of these can be a SKU for your
business to be selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what it's going to come down to
is also the material that you're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: source or grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also something that we're going
to get into here down the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So helps you attract more consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are consumers in the market and I'm
sure a number of them in this room right
[SPEAKER_05]: now that you probably will pretty much
only smoke solventless or maybe really
[SPEAKER_05]: good live resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the high end, the connoisseur,
the influencer consumers, this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: product that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if your lab isn't producing it,
then you're not even competing in that
[SPEAKER_05]: market in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're going to talk a little bit
about the different types of products that
[SPEAKER_05]: we see as the most popular that are being
sold the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now really hash rosin has risen
over the last couple years to be pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: much the dominant solventless product in
terms of quality, in terms of volume being
[SPEAKER_05]: sold at dispensers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Josh, running Cushmasters and making a
lot of hydrocarbon solventless,
[SPEAKER_05]: he makes a whole variety of products,
not just solventless.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you've been seeing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it's definitely the industry
trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I was just mentioning,
there's many different consistencies that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can make off of your solventless
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really off of the post-processing
and actually maximizing and using
[SPEAKER_03]: industry-specific equipment so that you're
optimizing your solventless venture
[SPEAKER_03]: because you don't want to leave two,
three percent behind and end up not having
[SPEAKER_03]: the extra that you could have that is
going to actually make your business
[SPEAKER_03]: viable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to talk about food grade
solventless and kind of dispelling the
[SPEAKER_05]: myth of how to get a better yield out of
your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: With hash rosin specifically, you're
seeing that people are really developing a
[SPEAKER_05]: taste for live rosin products.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like live rosin coming from fresh,
frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That terpene profile and for a whole
variety of other business reasons,
[SPEAKER_05]: labor, time, there's all these reasons
that companies are doing live products and
[SPEAKER_05]: live rosin is pretty much the king right
now in terms of high-end dabble
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Full Melt Six Star is also starting
to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the people that have been
enjoying hash for a long time,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a pretty unparalleled experience to
get great Full Melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, more and more places are trying hard
to produce Full Melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bricked Hash is making a comeback as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeing some really cool ice water
hash products and not to leave SIFT out of
[SPEAKER_05]: this, there's a lot of companies also
making really great SIFT rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower rosin, however, is a product that
we're not seeing as much of in mature
[SPEAKER_05]: markets like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: In newer markets, it's easy to produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot more of it there,
but as markets tend to mature,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're seeing a little bit less consumption
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk a little bit about that and
why you see those trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those trends are also because of the price
point of the flower compared to in that
[SPEAKER_03]: relative market.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, on the East Coast,
I'm sure pounds of flower on the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational and medical market are still
going for 3,000 plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Colorado, they're 2,000 and below.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll start to see those trends and those
shifts within those cannabis businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: and those MIPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those MIPS, we're basically going to be
able to create different skews and
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties based on the price points
they're able to start sourcing material.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the big dogs right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we see and have seen really great
opportunities for existing and new
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses to take advantage is with niche
solvent-less products.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a number of them out there and
there's producers all across the country
[SPEAKER_05]: that are building their brands and their
businesses today on these.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD and CBD rosin, we're going to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The proliferation of true rosin cartridges
is just going haywire right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many of these high-end hash
makers that are now starting to make
[SPEAKER_05]: cartridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Topicals and salves, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just having a product that is based in
rosin that is solvent-less is immediately
[SPEAKER_05]: a differentiator that people can identify
with and one that can also increase the
[SPEAKER_05]: price point of your product because it is
a higher quality product to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topicals and salves and edibles and stuff
like that, your grams concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be a dabble gram or something
that you want to hit the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're able to take that type of
product or even a second-price rosin and
[SPEAKER_03]: really shift those into those type of
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: That potency is going to go so much
farther than selling one gram out of your
[SPEAKER_03]: door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from my end of things, working in
marketing, talking with so many of our
[SPEAKER_05]: clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're marketing endeavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the most powerful tools you
can give a marketing team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your company is to say, this product is
solvent-less.
[SPEAKER_05]: This product is full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: This product has these quality identifiers
to it, whether or not it was made from a
[SPEAKER_05]: food-grade rosin or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more flexibility with
solvent-less now than there was a year ago
[SPEAKER_05]: when we were giving this talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot more businesses,
a lot more of our customers really
[SPEAKER_05]: diversifying what they're doing with their
material as they press it and turn it into
[SPEAKER_05]: a variety of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now more than ever, setting yourself apart
in this industry is exactly what you need
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to make a stamp and a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just before I move on, this picture again,
resolution not very good, but Poplin
[SPEAKER_05]: Barclay, one of our biggest customers out
in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've become famous for what they put
out are mainly topicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are one of our biggest customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of what they do with their
rosin is making topicals in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the clearest example of a brand in
an extremely competitive and difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: California is extremely tough to operate
in right now using a food-grade,
[SPEAKER_05]: high-quality rosin to make topicals and
being extremely successful with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One small example, obviously really nice
packaging doesn't hurt, but they do a
[SPEAKER_05]: really good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing, CBD rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that unlike Icewater
Hash and Sift is still very much in the
[SPEAKER_05]: mastery process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of businesses are really
trying to figure this out right now and a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of people are interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Farmhouse Hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're located in Fort Collins,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a video with them talking about
that, but that they use rosin for all of
[SPEAKER_05]: their CBD products.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some issues depending on the
concentrations of course, but using CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin is again a huge differentiator and
there's a ton of things that you can put
[SPEAKER_05]: it into.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just selling a CBD ram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the old CBD and you're pressing
something, you're activating it in X,
[SPEAKER_03]: Y, and Z, well, you're just concentrating
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will happen whether you're distilling
it or you're using ethanol or whether
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using solvent-less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to end up having a higher
concentration of THC in that product,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is going to make it uncompliant
within the farm bill to be shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you do at that point is you end up
mixing it into MCT oils or you end up
[SPEAKER_03]: making products themselves that because
even if it has 1% THC in the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate after you've made it,
well, after you've diluted into that one
[SPEAKER_03]: ounce jar for that pet, now you're maybe
0.1% THC and we're always allowed 0.3.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any products that you've seen on
the CBD side that are particularly popular
[SPEAKER_05]: right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pet products, tinctures, salves are
probably one of the most popular that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just totally on the market, but pet
products, I feel like anybody will do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything for their pets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, I know I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another big thing that we really get a lot
of questions about and now we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: lead into really actionable advice and
items for your business or any business
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're planning on starting is
explaining what yields with solvent-less
[SPEAKER_05]: look like and what they mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing is really shifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you've got flower rosin, you're
looking at ranges of 18% or above and all
[SPEAKER_05]: of these ranges are what you can expect
and what you should strive for with your
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now with ice water hash, specifically
since we've been talking a lot about that,
[SPEAKER_05]: when we're talking 4 to 8%, that's a fresh
frozen product.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a product that is about three
quarters wet weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about a dry to a dry
weight yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about a wet product yielding
into a final dry state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so taking a frozen and a dry pound,
basically your frozen pound will basically
[SPEAKER_03]: be like a quarter pound dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always use the math of 75-25 when
you're talking about frozen weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're talking about frozen
weight, four true frozen pounds equals one
[SPEAKER_03]: dry pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing your math and you do
your numbers based on these numbers,
[SPEAKER_03]: it equals that 18% range compared to that
4 to 8%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same math.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a different volume of water
within that bud mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and we're about to talk pretty
heavily about genetics because that is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be one of the key factors here in
how to achieve yields that are profitable
[SPEAKER_05]: for your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way to really think about this is
if you're trying to make a full melt
[SPEAKER_05]: product, you're trying to capture the best
trichomes you possibly can and sell that
[SPEAKER_05]: as a standalone product.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you would do as a business is wash
that product very gently at first,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you're going to go back and
you're going to re-wash it for a full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not just going to leave all of
those trichomes in the bag and leave them
[SPEAKER_05]: behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a multi-stage process to get
multiple products out of a single strain
[SPEAKER_05]: or cultivar that you're working with so
that, again, you can diversify the amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of products that you're actually selling
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same goes for sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might tumble what you've got very,
very gently to make a really high quality
[SPEAKER_05]: sift that you're going to press into your
best sift rosin, and then you can continue
[SPEAKER_05]: sifting it, getting more out of it to
create other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's what I was talking about
earlier where then you take that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're not going to end up hitting
the market with that is what I call a
[SPEAKER_03]: dabble concentrate, and you're basically
putting it in topicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're putting in edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're distilling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing all sorts of other
post-processing to create it into a final
[SPEAKER_03]: consumable product.
[SPEAKER_05]: With yield and solventless, it really
comes more down to the types of plants
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're running and the types of
strains that you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: With other types of extraction,
solvent-based extractions, one of the key
[SPEAKER_05]: questions we get asked all the time,
what really is the difference between a
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent and a solventless extraction
process?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take that on real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: He makes more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to look at a solvent process.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the solvent process, we're liquefying
all of the trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're liquefying, we're liquefying
them and then reclaiming that gas and
[SPEAKER_03]: leaving the THC and then purging that gas
off later in the post-processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: With solventless, what we're doing is
we're basically stripping it with either
[SPEAKER_03]: ice, water, CO2, dry ice, or just tumbling
it in itself or just pressing it in
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to be a little bit more delicate
with it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: With solventless, you're stripping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're basically keeping it as a whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full-melt, I'm sure you're all familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have different micron screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at each different micron screen,
you're going to have a different grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those different grades are going to create
a different final product for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it will allow you to do is stretch
that solventless material that much
[SPEAKER_03]: further to create that many more skews to
make your solventless business that much
[SPEAKER_03]: more viable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, what we are trying to do with
solventless is isolate the resin glands
[SPEAKER_05]: intact and then create various products
from those isolated trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas with solvent-based, it's a
dissolution process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just stripping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're liquefying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're also taking a bunch of fats and
lipids with it where we're actually able
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep it more pure throughout that
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we get rougher with that process,
we're able to get that higher yield for
[SPEAKER_03]: topicals, edibles, all sorts of other
different types of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sourcing proper material, whether you're
growing it or purchasing it for your
[SPEAKER_05]: business, is one of, if not the most
important steps to be successful with
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure as people in here who have
created solventless would know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we talk to our customers and sometimes
they run tangy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their cost per gram to produce it is they
are losing money on that gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas with other ones, they're making a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're washing Mac or you have some of
these other strains, your price per gram
[SPEAKER_05]: to wash and create that product,
there's a giant range there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to actually get material that's
going to work for solventless is one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the most important steps here.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're vertically integrated,
that gives you a lot of control because if
[SPEAKER_05]: your head grower is on board and actually
looking for genetics that they know will
[SPEAKER_05]: do well and they're strain hunting,
then that's really going to help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lineage and the genetics, we'll get
into a few strains and crosses and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a list out of just some things to
look out for.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you're going out and buying seeds,
as you're going out and buying clones from
[SPEAKER_03]: these different businesses, making sure
that the lineage is there so that those
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome structures, which we have a slide
here coming up that will show trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: structures and how full those trichome
heads are and if they're just shells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you look at a trichome head,
and if it's going to be full, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to end up having a much higher yield in
the solventless extraction process
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to if it's a shell, you just wash
that away.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you're going to have a half
percent or a one percent, and that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be more on your higher terpene of tangy
and those type of flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want more Ken type of flavor and
crosses, cakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we like to tell people is that if
you're growing your own, it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: important to identify strains that are
going to work well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we're just about to go into a
whole bunch of crosses and strains that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can start hunting for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're purchasing from a third
party, you really need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_05]: they are aware that either this product
has been washed in the past or this
[SPEAKER_05]: strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to ask them, can I get a little
bit to do a test wash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the grower aware that this may work
well or not for solventless in the first
[SPEAKER_05]: place?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of questions that you can
ask before you go all in on a batch that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to produce and turn it into
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, vet your grows and vet your sourcing
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is probably the best advice I can
give each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy test washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy three pounds of each strain that
they're growing in X, Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how they do in each different type of
solventless process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that gives you data and then that
also gives you partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're able to rely on you, you're able
to rely on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have this nice symbiotic relationship
where they are learning how you want it to
[SPEAKER_03]: come to your facility, how you want it
packed, how many increments.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those things are going to lead you
to very, very successful business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a slide here on some of the different
trichome structures and what they look
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Across the top, even though it's a little
hard to read, that's so small,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a spike 20, it's going to go pretty
much straight through your bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of hemp strains actually
that those are the types of trichomes kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of atop the top row there that you're
going to see that are common in certain
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD strains, which is why they can be
really hard to wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas with D here in the bottom left
corner, that is pretty much your ideal
[SPEAKER_05]: trichome structure for pressing the rosin,
washing or sifting because it's large
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to be captured well and it's got a
large glandular head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's full.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see a lot of trichome
heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to see those trichome
heads underneath the microscope,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it might be empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you see that trichome head shape,
it's got to be full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you're not going to end up
having a successful yield on your
[SPEAKER_03]: solventless material.
[SPEAKER_05]: With many of our most successful
customers, how they've gotten that way is
[SPEAKER_05]: by being relentless and detail-oriented
about how they select the material and the
[SPEAKER_05]: strains that they choose to run through
solventless so that they can increase
[SPEAKER_05]: their yields and increase their chance of
success.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting a jeweler's loop, looking at the
plant, seeing where the trichomes are,
[SPEAKER_05]: how big they are, what kinds they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that attention to detail that will
make the biggest difference in selecting
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics that you can really be profitable
on, really build your brand on,
[SPEAKER_05]: and get connoisseurs and influencers
behind your brand online for your
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to send this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this will be on Shaping Fire's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we put it on our website as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not secret information,
but these are some of the strains that we
[SPEAKER_05]: see with many of our customers and some of
the biggest hash makers online that the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars and the lineages associated with
many of these are so popular and they
[SPEAKER_05]: yield so well that they deserve special
attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like we have a note at the bottom
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so many great breeders
that come to this show and sell their
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of breeders are now really,
really trying to make strains specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: for rosin and solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh has had some pretty incredible
results with a couple of these at his own
[SPEAKER_05]: lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric Simpson, who's with us in the
audience, told us that he had a
[SPEAKER_05]: record-breaking wash of 9% on a related
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sitting right over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are some really great strains to
start with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a caveat here is that just because
you pop a chem-dog seed does not guarantee
[SPEAKER_05]: that that strain specifically is going to
yield 5-6% in your wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are generally lineages and cultivars
that have proper tricone structure and
[SPEAKER_05]: that have the best shot at being able to
give you a bud structure, a tricone
[SPEAKER_05]: structure, and a terpene profile that's
going to play nice with solventless
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the thing you also have to think
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're fully integrated, you're going
to be growing, these are the genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that you're going to want to be
sourcing and buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it also not only is going to give
you a versatile product, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: give the MIPS or what labs say you have an
influx of material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're able to sell that as solventless
material and hydrocarbon material.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't limit you one route or the
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you're probably getting 25,
50 bucks more per pound just because you
[SPEAKER_03]: got a versatile product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you're going to end up with clients
and you're going to end up with crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our video that we did together,
we talked about artisan blends where you
[SPEAKER_03]: grew it completely separate and then you
mix it up into the washing process to make
[SPEAKER_03]: a very interesting terpene profile like
the punch grump that we put out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essential extracts used to do that very
well too when they were around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's keys to being successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you're sourcing material, purchasing
seeds, definitely keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, keeping an eye on the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many hash makers and growers are really
proud of the products that they put out as
[SPEAKER_05]: they should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not shy about what kinds of
strains are working well for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Highly suggest going out, following hash
makers on Instagram that are making
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless, being successful with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're always talking about the new
strains that they're running.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to give you a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can pretty much guarantee that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, Hunt it, I'm sure,
or find a clone store who has a similar
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies and cream is a huge one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cream crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice cream, just on this list alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: GMO, Mac, the cake, and the chem dog
crosses and lineages are by far my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite on this list.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do you really, really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit that eight, nine percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of good options here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been told that roughly a quarter to
a third of phenotypes and strains out
[SPEAKER_05]: there are going to be in that profitable
yield range for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not every single one, but there's
more of them than people expect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a really, really big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we've gone through the idea of what
skews you're thinking about making,
[SPEAKER_05]: and whether you're an MSO, a multi-state
operator, looking to install the same lab
[SPEAKER_05]: in multiple states, or you're a boutique
grower who is just building your brand
[SPEAKER_05]: around a core line of solventless
products, really thinking about your lab
[SPEAKER_05]: space is one of the best things that you
can do for yourself early on in the
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be very exciting to be like,
yeah, man, we're going to buy a rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: press, and we're going to get in there,
and we're going to squish this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a solventless lab be very
successful in under a thousand square
[SPEAKER_05]: feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see people, and they are making their
rosin in a closet, and they are winning
[SPEAKER_05]: awards with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So square footage is one of the smallest
concerns, but planning against it is one
[SPEAKER_05]: of the most important things you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Streamlining your floor space and really
making sure that it's optimized for what
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys are really doing at your lab is
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So figuring out the skews, not only that
you want to produce in the future,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that you're going to be releasing when
you go to market, or the skews that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those things have to be factored
into place before you say, I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: put that route press on that table,
and I'm going to set the freeze dryer up
[SPEAKER_03]: here, and the washing machine over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that includes plumbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of little things that will
make your life a lot easier if you put
[SPEAKER_03]: things in the right spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who is considering getting into
this, or already is, and is looking to
[SPEAKER_05]: upgrade like we're talking about at the
very beginning, if you have questions
[SPEAKER_05]: about how many freeze dryers do I really
need, or how much space do I need to plan
[SPEAKER_05]: against, that's something that we can
actually help you guys out with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of the most popular
questions that we get asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got X amount of material that I'm
trying to wash a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I really need?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I really lay out my space?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I lay out my lab design?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've become pretty much the top dogs in
helping labs build and grow out with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy to help there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to add on this?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to leave a good 10 to 15
minutes here for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since the last time when we do
presentations, it went way over that,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it didn't kick us off the stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some predictions here that we're
expecting for 2020 and beyond,
[SPEAKER_05]: just based on the trends and speaking with
our customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosin cartridges are coming in hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are really excited about this
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not available in that many markets
yet, but now businesses are really
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to see that if I master my
solventless process, a cartridge is a
[SPEAKER_05]: product that is the luxury cart.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the top of the line product that
your business can sell pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to appeal to the widest range
of consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to add something to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be one of the bigger
things that we're going to see in 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will take some time to get your
business there to be launching all sorts
[SPEAKER_03]: of carts, all sorts of hash rods,
and it is a learning process and sourcing
[SPEAKER_03]: the right material to be coming out with
these exotic skews.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of businesses coming out in
Colorado with it, and really the
[SPEAKER_05]: progression is mastering the hash rosin,
mastering the SIF rosin, and then doing
[SPEAKER_05]: the R&D to create a product like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking $70 to $90 for a half gram
of these type of cartridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very high price points.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then niche solventless products like we
were talking about before, CBD rosin,
[SPEAKER_05]: topicals, edibles, especially a major new
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not a lot of businesses out
there that are promoting that and that are
[SPEAKER_05]: using those products and the solventless
as a differentiator to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now people are really picking up on
that as competition is increasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are looking for different ways to
differentiate themselves in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are going to be products you're
going to start seeing a lot more of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then many more labs that are not doing
solventless processing are starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: realize how much they're missing out on by
not competing in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting a lot of calls, and a lot of
people are coming to us saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, I've been thinking about this for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not really sure if this is going
to work for me, but all of my guys in the
[SPEAKER_05]: lab will not shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will not stop asking me when we're
going to start releasing rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot of these businesses
really starting to come out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: woodworks and realizing that this is an
area to compete in.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could start with 500.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then move up to 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have extra allocated space,
the cost to get into solventless
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction or add it to your business and
add all of those SKUs, I can guarantee you
[SPEAKER_03]: six months down the road, if you did half
of what we said on here, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have an extra three to six SKUs released.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those hundreds of stores that you're
already in are going to start to pick
[SPEAKER_03]: those up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then those invoices just keep going up and
up and up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing we'll close with here
before we go into the Q&A is from my
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective and from speaking with many of
our customers, it's hard to understate how
[SPEAKER_05]: big of a brand builder solventless can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a really, really flooded market with
cannabis products, having your brand be
[SPEAKER_05]: something that people recognize on the
shelf, whether it's through your
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging, really through the quality of
your product, that these are the kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: products that people are really talking
about and especially the influencers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just cannot understate that enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how some of these big brands like
Cushmasters, having come out, won an
[SPEAKER_05]: award.
[SPEAKER_05]: People talk about it on Instagram all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is free advertising for your business
and the value cannot be understated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 10 minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and raise your hand and we'll get
right to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We came in late.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may have already talked about the
equipment that you're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: If so, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did mention the freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I picked up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure pressure equipment, we have
everything from solventless equipment to
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze dryers to sift equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're basically a one stop shop for all
the solventless products that you would
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try and source everything that is going
to end up coming with certs, go doing all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of different and help you build your
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of touched on this earlier about
industry specific equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We built, designed all this equipment from
the ground up and made it functional from
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground up.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make sure that this solventless is
viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five years ago, it really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't being talked about because you
couldn't do it on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's really one of the highest
quality, highest price point things on
[SPEAKER_03]: shelves today.
[SPEAKER_05]: After this, with our booth at 411,
if you want to come by, we'd be happy to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk with you about the different options
and what kind of equipment you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really all based on what your
processing needs are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every business is going to need a
different solution and that's really the
[SPEAKER_05]: approach that we take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you showed the percentages that
you're coming out, but just straight away,
[SPEAKER_02]: unlike an average run that you're seeing,
from fresh frozen to your grade A hash
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin, one and a half percent,
two percent, what do you really think the
[SPEAKER_02]: average is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's monsters that dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's X factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: To rosin, you're looking at around three
percent to rosin on your average frozen
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'll have those dumpers that are
going to offset you and create it because
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, there is loss in each post-processing
that you do, which will then determine
[SPEAKER_03]: your yield at your finished product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then through that, it's also those
byproducts that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier from that post-processing that
you're able to extend and save and create
[SPEAKER_03]: that many more skews that now you,
it wasn't a loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what's going into the carts,
kind of like the BC grade stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the highest quality is really going
into the carts and that's partly the
[SPEAKER_03]: tricky part and why you don't see as much
of them on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: For states that have just gone medical or
states like Illinois or Missouri,
[SPEAKER_04]: have you seen any problem with production
of fresh rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the supply of fresh rosin not
being adequate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the supply is an issue in
some newer states because as markets
[SPEAKER_05]: mature is what we've seen pretty much
consistently across the board is that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, smokeable flour is the dominant
product when a market launches because
[SPEAKER_05]: people have not had access to this before
other than buying it on the street or from
[SPEAKER_05]: friends or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So getting fresh frozen product can be a
challenge for some businesses in emerging
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think some of these markets are
starting to leapfrog each other,
[SPEAKER_05]: whereas a couple years ago you could
barely buy it in some of the emerging
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then now in Illinois, you know,
things are getting more sophisticated and
[SPEAKER_05]: that people who are coming to shows like
these, going to the trade shows and
[SPEAKER_05]: learning things are thinking like,
okay, well, smokeable flour is going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: big today, but in five months from now I
know that I need to get a great source of
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh frozen so I can be washing and
making these kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_03]: As that trend goes down and as that price
point goes down as well, like we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking earlier, you know, in that market
more people will convert because there
[SPEAKER_03]: won't be as much of a demand for dry
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll convert it to fresh frozen and
then you'll see an increase in fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's kind of like Colorado
now where, you know, you can get fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen all the time or you can get dry
material all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just about the way the market
sits and how all of these grows set up
[SPEAKER_03]: their business for, you know, whether it's
that frozen model or that dry material
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see a lot of these dry material
models start to change and start to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh frozen as that price point drops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen anybody take the washed
material and then process it with solvents
[SPEAKER_07]: after?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, either dry the material and
then, you know, throw out the ACO2 machine
[SPEAKER_07]: or a hydrocarbon machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if so, what's the best way to get that
material prepped to run in those pieces of
[SPEAKER_07]: equipment after?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, if you have a giant facility,
I mean, it's totally doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you actually factor in the
profitability on the material,
[SPEAKER_03]: what you made on it and if you utilized it
all, you know, it's not necessarily worth
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The labor that it's going to take to be
able to re-extract it, dry it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have a lot of moisture in
it if you don't re-dry it after you just
[SPEAKER_03]: washed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have ice to melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's definitely problems with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, you know, could be down the line
some machines that, you know, will do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you would be having around a 2%,
3% yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you look at solvent extracts,
when you re-dump solvent over it after
[SPEAKER_03]: you've just extracted it again,
you're looking at a 3% yield or less out
[SPEAKER_03]: the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's basically waste
material at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have heard of some people taking that
approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like Josh said, it's very uncommon
because once you actually total up the
[SPEAKER_05]: labor, it ends up really digging into what
you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What most places are doing is doing,
again, multiple washes on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: material to start, you know, with that 3%,
which really dry weight is 12%,
[SPEAKER_05]: to getting that A grade hash product and
then washing again into more of a full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum, into more of a food grade and
just getting everything out of it so that
[SPEAKER_05]: your actual yield on your first grade,
you know, might be that 3%.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the total yield for, you know,
these more sophisticated extractors is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be a lot higher than that or at
least a bit higher than that by
[SPEAKER_05]: re-extracting it but through solvent this
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be our last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any, like, tricks that you do in
your grow to tell what's going to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, like, ways of, you know, kind of
something super greasy, is it going to
[SPEAKER_00]: wash well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not going to wash well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's, like, any tips or tricks you
can see from that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll start.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Josh has some really good input
on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, one of the tips that I talked about
in the beginning that we've heard from a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of places, I'm sure Josh does as well,
is, you know, using magnifying glasses and
[SPEAKER_05]: other magnification technology to look at
the trichomes beforehand and you can even,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, brush your finger on something
and see how well they detach because
[SPEAKER_05]: detachability of your trichome heads is a
really important thing to figure out.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a lot of places do is also a very
small test wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can even, I mean, there's people
that have done this, I think Ken Wall was
[SPEAKER_05]: one who put some info out of that most
recently, was just, you know, putting some
[SPEAKER_05]: in a jar and letting some of the trichomes
just naturally separate and then seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: how they settle and really eyeballing it
and seeing, you know, how much is in my
[SPEAKER_05]: jar right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this look like a lot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does this look like a little?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're doing a test wash,
there's a lot of things that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out before you're committing,
you know, tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh-roasting grams to actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's basically test washing
all of your genetics and looking at those
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome heads are keys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, starting with genetics that
you know are phenos that are going to wash
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you're going to have maybe
14 seeds of that genetic that you washed
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can wash those trichome head
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can wash all those phenos and then you
can decide, okay, this one was a dupper.
[SPEAKER_03]: This structure looked really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the three that I want to go into
my grow moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be the keys to dialing in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely trial and error.
[SPEAKER_05]: Test wash is the hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
