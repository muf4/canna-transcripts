[SPEAKER_00]: So Swami, thank you so much for having us
on the farm today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I wanted to ask you
while I was here is about the reverence
[SPEAKER_00]: and the spirituality in the plant,
because as cannabis becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: normalized and rulemaking and
bureaucracies become more involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are seeing cannabis more
as a commodity, as a widget, as a thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: market and get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are hitting vape pens
and kind of getting a little farther away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was curious to hear your thoughts
because in the early days during
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition, those who used cannabis were
a group that they knew each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was something that we did kind of
in secret to stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of easier to have the
reverence for the plant because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: already this level of shared, we could get
in trouble together vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with it more common and people
making jokes about it on television,
[SPEAKER_00]: TV shows and stuff, the feeling is
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of value in the
reverence for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a spiritual teacher and someone with
a history like yours, I thought you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have something to share with us about what
you see looking forward as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: reverence of the plant goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the point of reference is basically
what I talk about also, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: shared risk that we had in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That someone just smoking a joint on the
street could get three, five, who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: how many years and a grower likewise would
be vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a shared and it was a
secret society, as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a grower up here in the mountains would
only need to know maybe one or two dealers
[SPEAKER_01]: at the most who would come up and the
dealer in those days would come smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint and buy your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your whole crop wasn't very big either
because you were growing under the bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, it was just his trust and
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dealer would go back to the city
or would go to New York, wherever it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they only needed to know three or four
sub dealers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that sub dealer needed to know 10
or 12 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was kind of like a way that no one
had to really know very many people at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also the way the risk of getting
busted, even though it was shared,
[SPEAKER_01]: was reduced in a sense because there
weren't any outsiders, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to sometimes compare it to the
Harry Potter world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That in the midst of the American society
in those years, there was a whole other
[SPEAKER_01]: subculture and counterculture we talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these were people who were right every
there with you, but invisible in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that they all smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that was the whole sort of
thing is that there was a kind of secret
[SPEAKER_01]: club that you recognize and you knew that
someone was a stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were ahead, as we used to say in the
old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that was sort of this like
understanding that now we communicated on
[SPEAKER_01]: a different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something magic about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the idea that the action of
ingesting cannabis alters your
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes you more sensory aware,
but not just your five senses,
[SPEAKER_01]: but your sixth sense also gets stimulated
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to remember that this whole
growth of cannabis in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to a great extent in Europe,
it was already in the black community or
[SPEAKER_01]: the African American community and in the
Latin community, but the white community
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have it yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And through jazz and rock and roll,
all of a sudden all the hippies became
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the secret society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a whole kind of
understanding that, wow, there was these
[SPEAKER_01]: other groups too, and we're getting it
from Mexico and Columbia and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where does the reverence come?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reverence comes partly from the secret
society and from the actual effect that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has.
[SPEAKER_01]: It heightens your awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, we had this ritual of
passing the joint, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's getting less and less now as
everyone has their own vape pen and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't really pass the bong so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one hit, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this whole ritual of passing that
joint and the risk everyone had just to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it there and not be found out and to
share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the idea in the hippie community
for sure was this was an inspirational
[SPEAKER_01]: device.
[SPEAKER_01]: An inspirational substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't smoke it to get healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't smoke it to, no, we smoked it to
get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we smoked it to get high to be
inspired and to be inspired to paint or
[SPEAKER_01]: make music or draw or perhaps inspired to
climb a tree or make a beautiful meal or
[SPEAKER_01]: embroider a piece of thing or build your
house, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things became a different
activity once you were elevated through
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this became a point of,
this was again a shared consciousness on
[SPEAKER_01]: what we would call the sixth chakra,
that people had through their sixth chakra
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a telepathic kind of
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you throw in the rock concerts,
of course, where you have clouds of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tribalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that through dance and the music,
people then express their relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like on the dance floor, this is
traditional tribalist work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that on the dance floor,
you can dance flirt with anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that people then have an encounter
with some other partner in the dance floor
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the rock and roll world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could just dance with your partner
and do a whole sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was an expression in a way that
we were unable to express before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dancing in the streets was something that
the hippie tribe brought back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reverence partly came also from
the people way up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that growing a plant is a magical
experience, no matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even many people just growing
their house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a real connection with your house
plant and your watering and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize, well, that marginata
doesn't do so well in that corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you move it to another place and oh,
all of a sudden it's really a different
[SPEAKER_01]: plant now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this communication with your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go out into a cannabis
garden, full moon in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're inhaling this sort of,
because that's when also the plants put
[SPEAKER_01]: out all kinds of, I believe it's oxygen
they put out at night or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just in the garden and you're
surrounded by this living atmosphere that
[SPEAKER_01]: this greenness is exuding all around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up here in the mountains, you're
getting the air filtered by the Douglas
[SPEAKER_01]: fir and the oaks and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a whole sort of mystical
experience just to be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the people back in the mountains,
sometimes on a wood stove, making these
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of witches' brews, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of, well, let's have some cannabis and
then throw in some comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got St. John's ward and mull and all
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make up these preparations and
they put it into a salve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden everybody around is
saying, man, that really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, what happened here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of like, this is alchemy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Healing is mystical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back to ancient tradition,
the Druids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the Druids, it was the women who
were the herbalists and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of what's happened up
here too, is that so many of the people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the backwoods here have been herbalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting from right around here,
everything you need is growing right
[SPEAKER_01]: around here for whatever health purpose
you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus in our garden, we grow arnica and
echinacea and various other, we grow a few
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian herbs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mystical part now, it's
interesting because we've been working on
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do my plants, I just explained to
you before, when I do my plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the seeds and I put them at the
foot of the goddess of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganjama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a special mantra I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I put the seeds in the
ground to sprout them, I take a dropper
[SPEAKER_01]: and I put a drop of water from the sacred
Ganges River in India onto each seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say the mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So already we're starting the what should
we call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The inoculation of the spiritual intent
onto the seeds that has got sacred water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is for spiritual healing,
physical healing, and for inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a communal gesture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, people began to see
how magic this plant was because it just
[SPEAKER_01]: did all these things for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most beneficial plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a group that I'm part of,
which is a group called Kanamaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Namaste is an Indian Sanskrit word,
which means I salute the divine in you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we made it Kanamaste, I salute the
divine in cannabis and the divine in you
[SPEAKER_01]: that you share with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is founded by Chris Conrad and
Mickey Norris, who are long-term activists
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wonderful, wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've gotten to know them over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris at one point wrote this cannabis
creed for the cannabis church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we get together about once a
month or so, about, well, first it was 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's about 30, 35 of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get together and we gather,
we get in a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, everybody brings a
little bit of flower, cannabis flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we make a joint of everybody's
contribution and we get a cone this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just fill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the beginning of the ceremony,
we pass this joint around to everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody smokes of the sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we repeat the cannabis creed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are various other parts of a
ritual sequence that we're perfecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Chris's point of view for this is that
he's always been about getting people out
[SPEAKER_01]: of jail because they use cannabis for
health purposes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gotten many people out of jail
testifying as an expert, not a lawyer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's an expert witness in courtroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came up with this inspiration and he
said, well, actually this could be a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get people out of jail that say,
I belong to the cannabis church.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sacrament says I have to smoke it to
be part of the church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone else is part of the church and
they grow it and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's essential part of the ceremony
that you add, like with a peyote church.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not taking the peyote,
I don't think you can be part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: peyote church.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this would then likewise be a
plausible defense for someone in a state
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's not legal to say that,
look, I've been a member of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: church for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody objects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden I get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm part of the church.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to be a religion,
you have to say, well, a religion has
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we say, okay, can I not say we've got
this, this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get back to the first
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Congress can't make any laws about
religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that you have freedom of
religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says Congress can't make laws
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially that's supposed to mean
you have freedom of religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the spirituality that's
innate in the plant, that's what actually
[SPEAKER_01]: initiates and facilitates the healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we find out we have
endocannabinoids, interior cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they're kind of exactly like,
and the one we know is now called
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now who came up with that name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stoned out scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know what anandamide means?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ananda is an unbelievably beautiful,
significant Sanskrit word, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: translated most often as bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the divine essence, even though it's
one indivisible, is seen as sat chit
[SPEAKER_01]: ananda, being consciousness bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can be described about the
ultimate isness of consciousness,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever way you want to describe the
ultimate divinity in Sanskrit is called
[SPEAKER_01]: sat chit ananda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the famous guru called sat chit
ananda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sat is being, chit is consciousness,
and ananda is bliss, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bliss molecule that we have in
our brains is part of the thing that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor for cannabinoids in your brain,
and the anandamide is the one that gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you that good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are certain scientists who are
beginning to say in the medical world that
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to investigate anandamide and the
name of that endocannabinoid molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide, that perhaps many conditions
are a result of anandamide deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bliss molecule you don't have enough
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so particularly THC then comes in and
augments your endocannabinoid anandamide
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to bring back the bliss in your
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bliss being a divine attribute,
that it is that essential divinity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant which is being transmitted that the
THC then augments the deficiency of the
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you chew out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, a friend of mine who just was here
came and visit and he's got five
[SPEAKER_01]: daughters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And his wife and they have a wonderful
household and they're all cheerleaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the wife, but the five daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them now is for the Minnesota
Vikings and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've won cheering championships all
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, seriously, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two times that group has won, I guess,
I don't know if it's a world championship,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had one daughter who was always so
hyper and always kind of mean and always
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, it was tough to deal with and so
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally when she got old enough,
she now got ahold of the vape pen,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was, and all of a sudden she just
chills out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her life is so much easier and she
gets along with all her sisters and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the replacement of the
deficient anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that that was the idea that she needed
more bliss in her life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many conditions of our life of
stress can be alleviated through a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny puff of bliss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's part of how we see the inner
workings of the divine workings that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's how doctors actually got into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, okay, we have this molecule in
our body, which is a receptor for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't find the cannabinoids first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What fits in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would that be there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they said, well, if that's there,
the body itself must produce something
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it wouldn't just produce it if it
had to come from outside the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the theory anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they said, okay, this stuff fits
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that looks exactly like this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know the XO or phyto,
as they call them, phyto cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they said, wow, this is an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're beginning to say, because
there's the other one, 2-GA is the other
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one is out through the rest of
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently virtually all your body
organs have cannabinoids in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that people are beginning to
say that like the ensemble in the smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an ensemble in your body of the
connectivity of the endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the endocannabinoids within your body
are a messaging system between all the
[SPEAKER_01]: organs, between the kidney and the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's actually saying like there's a
circulation system, a nervous system,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now some people are saying,
well, it's actually an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, which is the feedback loop,
the feedback loop within the nerve system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has got a lot of medical people
very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also got the pharmaceuticals
really scared because if you can grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: world's best medicine in your backyard,
and that's another thing I always like to
[SPEAKER_01]: say about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know any people on a
paleo diet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big popular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whenever you see them again,
you make sure you tell them, if you're on
[SPEAKER_01]: a paleo diet, your medicine is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you had some, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: White willow bark, which is kind of like
aspirin or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had all the other herbs, but the go to
one for every case was always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're a paleo diet,
that's your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a lot of the reverence and
spirituality that we experienced from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was because it was prohibited and we
did it together in small ceremonies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nowadays it's becoming more
commodified with pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the new folks getting
into cannabis was likely to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: shared reference instead of just seeing it
as aspirin?
I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of faith in our younger
generation, and I know an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: young people are really into flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there are dabs in the pens and so
on, but there's a whole group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, take the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember two buck, Chuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: $2 for a bottle of wine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, all these people who
never drank wine before are drinking wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big guys, the fancy, the $20
buying bottle guys, the Joseph Heitz and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whatever, they say, oh God,
it's the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then three years later, all of their
sales went up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you get a $2 bottle of wine,
hey, it's your girlfriend's birthday,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's bring five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your anniversary, 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty soon you're saying, well,
what's the real stuff taste like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vape pen, convenient, discreet,
fills the total need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at a certain point, if you're really,
say you're into organic food, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be smoking sun-grown, pure organic
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't know what's in those
vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know if it was grown
organically or with pesticides or what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's likely not whole plant either,
it's just parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your pre-rolls too are always,
I don't call it the sweepings off the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor, but you never can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lowers anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lowers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the true connoisseur, and there
will always be such, will want that $30
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban cigar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's a Swami joint, it's almost
two and a half, three grams, it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: $50 joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it smokes in a different way,
as you found out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a pinner, but something that's a
full, full joint actually smokes in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way and gives you a different
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the spirituality thing now,
the people who are coming in, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the corporate people,
the commoditization people and so on,
[SPEAKER_01]: the not touch the plant people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the business, but they don't
smoke at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nor do they touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even to manicure it, cure it, we'll do
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all of us who are growing and
trimming and manufacturing, we touch the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, there's a radiation
between you and the flowers of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system is part of
our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll has a certain chemical
structure with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take hemoglobin and you put it
next to the molecule of chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize that they're exactly the same,
except that chlorophyll has nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemoglobin has iron molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the iron in the hemoglobin,
everything else being the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll, takes the oxygen in your
blood to your cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen in the chlorophyll,
helps nitrogen produce oxygen in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, there's one molecule
different between chlorophyll and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how close we are to plants as
living beings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me that then, that becomes another
dimension of the mysticism, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're so connected to this plant that
I see a consciousness within the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to listen to my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say they talk to their plants and
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that too, but more often I really try
to listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they now are on the wavelength
that you are on and they're giving you
[SPEAKER_01]: messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who are coming in to commodify
this thing, I think the industry will
[SPEAKER_01]: change them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're going to change the
industry that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without the flower, you don't have
anything really, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now back to the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sort of implying that the hippies
brought the spiritual aspect, but that is
[SPEAKER_01]: not at all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The African-American influence,
the blues community, the jazz community
[SPEAKER_01]: was totally into the spirit of cannabis
and also the Latin American community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's rewind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3,000, 5,000 years ago in ancient India,
there were these texts which were chanted
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Rig Veda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was poems singing the praises of
this stuff called Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right from the start of these Rig Veda
verses, they're all sacred chants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're chanted hymns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the very first page, they talk
about Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for years, modern scholars have tried
to figure out what was this Soma stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: man?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were drinking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting totally high.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the guys who's done a lot of
research is a guy named Chris Bennett.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have seen his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I interviewed him last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Chris Bennett is like a gold mine of
information about the ancient use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's traced it in very convincing
argument, even though he's not a Sanskrit
[SPEAKER_01]: scholar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to those books up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these talk about this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a libation and drink from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people drink it and they want to drink
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get frivolous and happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant that it comes from is
gold and green and purple and yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you see all those colors out there
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people who tried to argue that
it was Amanita mascara mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people argue that was some sort of
psilocybin mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really look at the words of the
text, it's describing stalks and stems and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty clear that it's actually
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then jump to the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Chris Bennett points out the sacred
anointing oil in the Bible, the holy
[SPEAKER_01]: anointing oil, was made from several
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the main ingredients was called
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scholars have always translated that
it's calamus, which is an herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an herb without any special real
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would it be in the holy anointing oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you say cannabism is a phonetic
cognate, technical term to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabism, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, perhaps our whole word cannabis
comes from the Hebrew cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's considerable argument,
in fact, and I'm very convinced,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, it would be that the holy
anointing oil was cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even today in India, if you hang
out with the babas, like I've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: they wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a chilling, they put in charros
or hash and the mix with tobacco and they
[SPEAKER_01]: start smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tobacco was developed in Brazil in the
New World.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more than like 300 years ago,
those babas were smoking not with tobacco,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were smoking with most likely with
flower cannabis or all kind of other herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was part of a sacred ritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things they did is pass it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say mantras when they
smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can say, or all these different
chants that you do when you smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: with babas in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you pass the chillum,
you cover your heart and you only use your
[SPEAKER_01]: right hand and you pass it always to your
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very often you'll also say a mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've adopted that in our kanamaste
ritual for our sacred cannabis church,
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you pass the joint, you cover
your heart and you pass the joint and you
[SPEAKER_01]: say kanamaste to pass that, to recognize
both the divinity and the plant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: divinity in each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that this is an ancient tradition that
goes way, way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that soma is the magical
elixir of the Rig Veda and of the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and it's still used today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea that regardless of the
culture, whether it was hippie culture or
[SPEAKER_00]: jazz culture or Brazil, wherever the
culture was, this idea that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: inherent spirituality to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it is your friend's
cheerleader's daughter or your friend's
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter, who's a cheerleader,
when you find the plant and it's the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, it kind of calls you and you are
opened up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those people will treat
cannabis like McDonald's because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some people who treat food like
McDonald's, but there are other people who
[SPEAKER_00]: will get pulled into her and see the more
spiritual and mystical parts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, about the spiritual mystical
parts, out in the garden I showed you the
[SPEAKER_01]: statue of Ganjama, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was a vision that came to me
of the goddess of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja is the Sanskrit word for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganjama, she's the mother goddess of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have her in the garden and I put
the seeds in her lap at her feet for a
[SPEAKER_01]: moon cycle before we plant them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we chant a mantra which goes with
the goddess, ganja mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, we put a drop of
Ganges water from the sacred Ganges river
[SPEAKER_01]: on each seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, as I said before,
inoculating the plant with the seed with a
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual intention, with an idea that
this is a spiritual healing, a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: healing and an inspirational source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is putting in these other
dimensions of the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledging them right in the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our goddess sits out in the garden
and we have another who sits back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like when I took my very first
plant the other day, I took a flower off
[SPEAKER_01]: of that and put it up as an offering to
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you grow anything, if you're
growing it in your backyard on a really
[SPEAKER_01]: small scale, I don't care who you are,
you're gonna get into the magic of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something you put a seed in the
ground and up it comes and it's giving you
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes or it's giving you a zucchini or
cucumber, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a home garden, this is just like,
this is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel the essence of growing,
of life being generated out of a tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: little seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that after a while, if you're an
old hippie baba like me, you again put
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness into the plant you project
it into the plant and it then answers you
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you create this dialogue where you're
listening to the plant as much as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I see is that consciousness as
an entity almost is a continuum scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that is manifested in the
physical matter is on that scale of
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that a chunk of cement has within it a
molecular consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even in physics, they talk
about, you know, nucleus, electrons,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they talk about a strong force
and a weak force, which is like this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's like birds of a feather flock
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The molecules of concrete hold together
because they all know their consciousness
[SPEAKER_01]: is concrete in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know this is hippie dippy,
woo, woo, woo, new age stuff, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every molecule is a vibrant thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecules, they have electrons spinning
around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just static.
[SPEAKER_01]: The atoms are not dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's an actual mineral or a piece
of rock or anything else, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a radiational field around
each atom, which connects it to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: atoms that recognizes the fact,
oh, that's a stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we recognize each other
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a stoner over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this recognition that we
are connected through some extra physical
[SPEAKER_01]: force in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis has that ability for us to
actually sense and recognize that force.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, it heightens your awareness of
your five senses and your sixth sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the basis for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spirituality right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you get back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck with your show and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to get the information out
there and share it with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I say, I have great faith in all
the young people I'm meeting who just also
[SPEAKER_01]: are realizing the sacredness of the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, at a certain point,
the people up here in the mountains over
[SPEAKER_01]: time developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm painting a romantic picture of it
just like you did, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: About the way it was in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a sense of mission,
a sacred mission that we didn't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: how good this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even know that it was a healing,
healing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we knew somehow deep in that this
was something that had to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there was a mission about,
you know, creating this medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: making it available to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now disseminating the information
about how the best way to use it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the whole of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look forward to that in our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need a sip of water or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'd really like is a joint,
but we're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
