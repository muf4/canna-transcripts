[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis seeds are not all bred the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are bred for indoor growing and have
little relationship to the geographic area
[SPEAKER_03]: that are grown in because they never
actually interact with nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other seeds are bred for outdoor growing
and historically have come from
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays, as cannabis is being
normalized and breeders have been able to
[SPEAKER_03]: come out of the shadows and connect in
groups, we are finding that each bio
[SPEAKER_03]: region is starting to develop seeds that
work best on their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I live in the Pacific Northwest on
Vashon Island, we need genetics where the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower finishes quickly and early before
the October rains start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up until now, that has usually meant
growing cultivars that bloom for 8 or 9
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks, ending the mid to end of October,
and we just have to go in knowing that
[SPEAKER_03]: they probably won't fully mature before
the rain and cold set in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now though, breeders are bringing seeds to
market that finish in as few as 50 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: putting harvest more towards October 1st
or even earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: These new genetics open up outdoor growing
to a much wider range of home growers who
[SPEAKER_03]: live in areas of the country with shorter
summers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to these breeders, we are eternally
grateful.

[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_03]: The intro to today's show is going to be a
little longer than usual.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two extra topics I want to cover
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I want to give my sincere thanks to
Zach Badgett for saving my crew on our way
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Canna Luminati party on Saturday
night of Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: He and his buddy Brennan were following
the crappy driving direction that Google
[SPEAKER_03]: Maps was giving out to the party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Along their route, they came across my
crew in our car that had gotten stuck in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mud on an unimproved road where we
should not have even been in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place, but Google Maps took us there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did the guy spend a good amount
of time trying to pull our car out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: mud, but Zach even went all the way and
used his AAA membership to get a tow truck
[SPEAKER_03]: out there, which got us out of the mud
with no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did Zach offer to let us use his
AAA membership, but it meant that his good
[SPEAKER_03]: time at the Canna Luminati party was
interrupted a few times because he first
[SPEAKER_03]: had to call AAA and then go back again and
meet up with the tow truck folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks to both you guys and especially
thanks to Zach, who gave up his money and
[SPEAKER_03]: time to make sure that we were okay and
able to get to the party instead of being
[SPEAKER_03]: stuck out in a field somewhere due to bad
directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I offered to pay for Zach's AAA membership
for the year, and thanks, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he wasn't having it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just asked me to let him know if I
heard of any real really good hash jobs
[SPEAKER_03]: for an experienced professional hash
maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is for you, Zach.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listeners have a legal cannabis
business that produces ice hash or hash
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin, and you want a trustworthy guy who
is easy to get along with and has solid
[SPEAKER_03]: production skills, I encourage you to
reach out to Zach Badgett on his
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is Constellation underscore Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach is based in Washington state right
now, but he is willing to move for the
[SPEAKER_03]: right job.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is presently on the hash production
team at Constellation Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you follow my Instagram, you have heard
me talk before about how great their hash
[SPEAKER_03]: and hash rosin carts are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know Zach is looking for a role with
more responsibility, so he said it was
[SPEAKER_03]: okay if I tried to get him a job more
publicly with one of you great listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks again, Zach.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a shining example of the cannabis
community looking out for each other when
[SPEAKER_03]: things go bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the other thing I want to do is to
thank those of you who have left the
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred of positive reviews of Shaping
Fire Online where you get your podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm usually so busy doing interviews and
traveling and just doing life that I never
[SPEAKER_03]: really looked at the reviews people were
leaving about the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those reviews are really important in
order to be seen, so I'm really grateful
[SPEAKER_03]: for anybody that leaves a nice review
wherever they get their podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the holidays, I was reading some of
the reviews left on Apple podcasts,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I want to share just two of them with
you and thank the folks that left them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, I want to thank Kcedel77
who says, well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few good cannabis podcasts out
there, but Shango is possibly the best
[SPEAKER_03]: host in that he asks good questions and
isn't afraid to let the guests talk for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while without interrupting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of knowledge while still maintaining
a laid-back atmosphere for the guests and
[SPEAKER_03]: the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done, Shango.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, CBDNA Labs says,
the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a far commute to work,
but I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been looking for excuses to drive
for months because of Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many thanks to Shango and his guests for
an incredible podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have found answers to questions I didn't
even know I had on every episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bravo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, hearing this feedback is
really inspiring, so thank you to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody who left a review.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today my guest is cannabis breeder Nat
Pennington, founder of Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nat has been providing cannabis seeds
since 2001 and has been growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: professionally since he was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nat is also a world traveling biologist
and fisheries expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: who has helped defend the environment and
the rights of indigenous people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon, as well as his present fight to
restore salmon habitat in Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we're going to talk about breeding
cannabis for short bloom cycles,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as a bit on autoflowers,
tissue culture, and genetic markers such
[SPEAKER_03]: as breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, Nat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I've been aware of you for
years, but I really only zeroed in on you
[SPEAKER_03]: after your interview with Kevin Jodry
during the Wonderland Nursery Seed Series,
[SPEAKER_03]: which Shaping Fire sponsored.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to watch that interview and I'm
like, oh man, this guy's cool and he's got
[SPEAKER_03]: depth and oh man, I want to hear him a lot
more than 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I then recently was checking out your
new 2020 seed catalog and I saw all these
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars with bloom cycles under 60 days
and then you totally got my attention
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, most of us outside
California do not have the same perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis growing weather that you have
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need shorter bloom cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've bred flowers as short as 45
days, which is a godsend when trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: beat those October rains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So up till now, if I wanted to get
something under 50 days, it was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be some kind of shishkeberry
cross or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: What inspired you to start to cross and
sift specifically for short blooming
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, we were obviously
humble is not what people commonly think
[SPEAKER_00]: of when they think about California in
regard to weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not out here, you know,
wearing shorts and tank tops all year
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have quite a normal, you know,
decent winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, October, it gets a little
touch and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially towards the end, when it comes
to not only just like having to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: molds and mildew and things like that,
but even like frost, depending what your
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation is and and humbled also is this
area with terrain and mountainous terrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anyway, we.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed for shorter season flower or shorter
flowering type cannabis, but I do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that really, initially, that was an
inadvertent thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've been breeding here at
Humboldt Seed Company for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story of how we started doing
shorter season varietals is is unique and
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it can I really dive into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks out there that have done a lot
of breeding, you may have noticed how
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly cannabis acclimates to your
environment, and I kind of think it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more malleable crops out there as
far as, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really changing even in the course of a
generation or two, or I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: folks have noticed, but like even clones
that obviously don't aren't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going through when they're propagated,
they're not having genetic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular myosis or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even clones I've noticed can have kind
of epigenetic changes and adjust to their
[SPEAKER_00]: new indoor environment, let's say,
or or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis malleable species and.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what I found was, you know,
basically our breeding practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly back in the late 90s and
early 2000s, were a little bit more kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we weren't as as specifically
directed or focused, and I say I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was sort of just right
after cannabis was legalized medically in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there it was OK that we
weren't exactly like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you know, one of the things that
we would do is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making crosses with a popular clonal
variety that might be going around humbled
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as as often as those as the clone
crosses, we're finding these wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kept alive in the hills of
Humboldt and seed form and picking the
[SPEAKER_00]: best and making crosses from those.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things when breeding,
you know, with regular seed, doing regular
[SPEAKER_00]: male female breeding is essentially you're
waiting to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what sex this lot of plants that
you're picking from might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say I'm going to round off
numbers to make this easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that we're breeding our
mango tree line and we crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 seeds and we're looking at and this is
back then we're doing bigger populations
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, but we've got 200 seedlings in
trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We transplant them up into a five inch pot
or a gallon or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like 15 inches,
maybe a couple of feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to like look at the sex
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determine, you know, really what we would
do is make sure that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best looking plants out of that larger
population and set them aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our breeding plants and we,
you know, as males were showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their sex as well, we'd be, you know,
rubbing the stems and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and doing all the selection that
we do for males, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I mean we were already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already knew that we were really,
really interested in breeding and I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it was only a few years later that we kind
of formalize that by going and and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know the business Humboldt seed
company down here in Eureka at the
[SPEAKER_00]: courthouse, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that was so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long before you know we have like Humboldt
farm and Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you could ever imagine,
but this was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I just felt so funny in the
courthouse because the ladies there and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was asking is there a Humboldt seed
company and she's like, oh, let me check
[SPEAKER_00]: the databases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said no and I'm like OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start a business with that
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks at me and what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said I'm doing vegetable seeds
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your location?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave her my address and you're going
to sell it farmers market and I said yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think at that time we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always had different kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention was to have a cannabis seed
company, but down there that day at the
[SPEAKER_00]: courthouse it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just Humboldt seeds of any kind,
so back to the point.
I.
[SPEAKER_00]: New we wanted to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that that was what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interested me and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year the first priority was pick
your breeders and set them aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be in the main.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden area so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of them, make them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then I'd go and later on I'd do
my whole breeding setup, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set him aside and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, what I found over the years is
that had a huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effect on the flowering time of the plants
because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I was looking and choosing for the
breeding population first and without even
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it, I was inadvertently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the ones that had that pre flower the
the way that we determine sex on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On regular plants without you know
genomics, which you know I find to be
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively easy, it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for some folks, I think,
but you just just experiential knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you get it once you see enough
little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Male parts and yeah, it becomes it becomes
really familiar to you and you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: male, female, male.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I get where you're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were you were splitting up these
plants and so because you you were
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choosing plants because they were showing
early, which means that they were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a business exactly so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the ones that they were the ones
that were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably you know that's a relation and
it's a relation that I've I've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: seen as tangible as.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really the ones that tend to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, identify themselves as male or
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are also a little bit, you know the
earlier flower, but you're still talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a population, so if you're selecting
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your OG population, let's say or sourdise
kind of those kinds of things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: later flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you won't be able to sex the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid May, but some of these earlier
flowering types, you can really sex them
[SPEAKER_00]: early on and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the population that
eventually led into like varieties like
[SPEAKER_00]: our blueberry muffin, other earlier
flowering varieties at a point right
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you know, 2006, 2005, 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like realizing because I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It my own experiences and.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other of the farms that you know
would give a lot of reports back about how
[SPEAKER_00]: our seeds were performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would actually say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering is happening way too early and
we're not getting as much yield because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so there's this kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect balance that we end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striving for when it comes to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering time and and particularly,
you know, for those that are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know in the natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period, you know the just growing
and full sun without light deprivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to why we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: More.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quicker flowers flowering types than.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know, maybe some others have to
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over the years that was something
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of learned to balance and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really hone in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody does enjoy kind of
having a quicker flowering type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, because.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know sometimes, especially with things
like the roses and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain gosh, certain land race rivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we've.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of growers that have grown a
lot of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have had that plant that you're you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing your friends at Thanksgiving
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is like 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be harvesting this thing next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally and.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things you'll you're never going
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep the the strain true to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you can't change too much about
the flowering time, but you can certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: shorten it by a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in my experience and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that could be said for for a lot
of things like the classics like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel that tend to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little on the longer side for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still, you know, keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is recognizably sour diesel
with Terpens and structure and the high
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe cut off a couple weeks,
which is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's so that's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's breeding right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's improving something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without I don't feel like you know you're
not jeopardizing too much by doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really selecting within a
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and you know everybody's always
grateful for that too because the shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: the bloom cycle the less time there is for
something to go wrong right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like one of the challenges with
these long I mean where I live on Vashon
[SPEAKER_03]: Island in the Pacific Northwest anything
over eight weeks is we consider long but
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you've got somebody who's got a
12 week or it's like oh my gosh you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: so much time to run into potential pest
problems that you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: solve during flower when your options are
very limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you know it's if you can knock a
couple of weeks off of a long bloom cycle
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's to everybody's benefit so long
as the flower you know still still comes
[SPEAKER_03]: out being the haze or whatever that you're
hoping it is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you were talking about the few flowers
that started blooming early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that for you pretty much equate with
ending early too because you know you
[SPEAKER_03]: might have something that that might start
flowering early but then it still doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: finish until the second or third week of
October which is really at the at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of reasonable for most of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice if not only if that if it
starts flowering earlier than it than
[SPEAKER_03]: others but then it also drags that
finishing time forward to the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: September too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find normally that that when you're
doing these large sifts that the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: are starting early are also finishing
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and for the most part I'd say that
that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know you're moving the you're
really just the flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely static.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it is a little bit dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain varieties I'm sure folks have
seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you basically flip the lights to
1212 and next thing you know off they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it just seems like you know within a
few days you're noticing the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: and and then next thing you know you've
got significant flowers put on which is I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's really what the goal is is to
get that you know initial chunk to start
[SPEAKER_00]: early enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're working in indoors it's
a little bit easier to kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between that because when
you're doing outdoor of course if if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're let's say up in Washington you know
the lights changing and certain varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: will you know trigger into flower earlier
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just you're essentially taking
the flowering cycle and moving it up a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the end gets moved up a
few weeks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean that and that is effective for
that goal if you if you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid the problems that are associated
with having you know big beautiful flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the rain or the freezing cold then
that's completely effective for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that there's another factor
that we're also considering which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: how fast the flowers actually grow and how
you know how much of the plants energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly just getting devoted to putting
on flower weight versus continuing to put
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into stalk and leaf growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know I think a lot of the time I
do associate those earlier flowering ones
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they kind of go all in on
flowering too which is I know we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about autos in a little while but
that you know for me I see I think of it
[SPEAKER_00]: as kind of the difference between annual
and perennial plants and where the the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant really is putting its energy at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me you know I think of it being a
fish biologist for years while I was also
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and running the company when I
couldn't be as big of a company I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: really know and understand salmon and
steelhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting thing about salmon and
steelhead is that steelhead can live after
[SPEAKER_00]: they reproduce so they can spawn a number
of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas salmon just kind of you know they
have to expend all of their energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction into swimming up the river
they pretty much stop eating and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a person that you know also likes
to fish and eat salmon and steelhead I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you right now that the best I think I
really enjoy the taste of the salmon
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're having a this is a creature
that knows that it has to put a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of energy into this one special
moment and when you harvest it if it's at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right moment then you're essentially
you know that energy is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think of that with with cannabis and
some of these shorter flowering varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of like salmon where they're just
like okay we know that this is the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it and we're gonna throw everything
we have into basically you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to do which is reproduce
and we're getting in there and harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: it at this moment where the plant is just
full of of ever you know all life and and
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrant and you know big chunky beautiful
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that interpretation of it is
really you know poetic if not spiritual
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know you're you're talking
about all life having this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: moment when it when it gives its full
expression of who it is in the natural
[SPEAKER_03]: system and it and it puts it all on and
you're right some of these shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: blooming flowers when they come on they
come on like gangbusters and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one of the things that those of us
who have the opportunity to walk through
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens with you know many plants let's
you know you can do it with you know five
[SPEAKER_03]: or six plants but let's let's say 25
plants when you can walk through and all
[SPEAKER_03]: these plants are expressing themselves
fully and and we're looking at them and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're smelling them and we're both the
plants and us are reacting to the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we can feel that energy
that's going between the sun and the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and us and I think that's one of
the reasons that we are so in love with
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant is because we can participate
in that at an energetic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly and yeah and it's it's okay I mean
we're we're all creatures and we all you
[SPEAKER_00]: know give and take from all the different
kind of life forces on the planet and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm a I'm an omnivore I I love going
out and harvesting broccoli out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and fishing and all those things
and it's you do you kind of when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting something and especially if
you've put a bunch of energy into it
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's you know growing tomatoes
in your garden or growing cannabis or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know taking care of the wild world that
you live in when you're harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that and you have that real
connection with it it's it's such a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: of beauty to you know be so proud and hold
that thing in your hand and then you know
[SPEAKER_00]: go have a stir-fry yeah I feel like that
it's a real it is it's it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we go to commercial because
we're a little over but I want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that we hit on something because
we've certainly talked about you know how
[SPEAKER_03]: you moved toward growing these short
blooming types and it ended up being kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like just systemically you just started
getting shorter ones because of how you
[SPEAKER_03]: worked your sifts which is really
interesting and then we've talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: like the you know the the energetic
expression of these plants but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: also people who are listening who are like
meticulous breeders who are looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: some kind of guidance from you of how to
do the selection so before we you know
[SPEAKER_03]: since second set we're going to be talking
more about auto flowers I want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that we get this in here so would you
explain to us a little more like on the
[SPEAKER_03]: brass tacks like operational level when
you are doing your sifts how are you
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically selecting for short bloom
cycles and making sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate on those sure well you know so
I think I explained initially there was
[SPEAKER_00]: some inadvertent sifts that happened in
the spring where we were prioritizing
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and so choosing first the plants
that showed out of that group we'd choose
[SPEAKER_00]: the best ones and you know then set them
aside so that led to all of a sudden now
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do that every single season every
every time we're breeding then holy cow we
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually make things almost flower too
early too quick and and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in like 2005 2006 right around
that time it it dawned on me that look we
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of we're controlling this
and so now let's control for exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers want which you know maybe that's a
fuel type that normally would flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: mid to late October let's see if we can
get it to flower and finish you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: mid mid to early October and that actually
really was easier than I ever thought and
[SPEAKER_00]: so basically what we were doing was just
initially seeing which ones happen to to
[SPEAKER_00]: show first and then of that population
putting that through the other rigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: selection that we would normally do to
make sure that it had the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic expressions the type of
terpenes that we're looking for and and
[SPEAKER_00]: then eventually you know testing for
cannabinoids and all the the more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that we have the capability to do
now but you know gosh this has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-year process and it's incredible what
we can do now with the you know genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and and even just simple like lab
stuff that we can utilize but back then
[SPEAKER_00]: and and something that's still no matter
how fancy the equipment that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to I wholeheartedly believe that
90% of of any breeders work should be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically phenotypic selection and or you
know and the personal experience of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and and all just stuff that you
don't really need that expensive lab
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for and that's something that
kind of equalizes this industry which you
[SPEAKER_00]: know now we've got folks coming in that
have all the money in the world to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: on all that lab equipment and it's boy
thank gosh that you really need to know
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to be able to do proper
cannabis breeding and the more time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy that you've spent with the plant
the more that you understand how malleable
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to to you know form that in in a
direction that you want like let's say a
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker flowering type plant the more
years that you've got under your belt the
[SPEAKER_00]: the better that the easier that'll be for
you but for folks that really want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: that I it's it's a couple things you know
early on you can really be effective by
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing selection and noting which ones
do show sex earliest that is more powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: than anyone would probably expect and it
was something that dawned on us years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: we almost did too much of that we kind of
reversed it now we've learned how to
[SPEAKER_00]: control it and then of course the next
thing is just you know looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering if the cool thing is is you can
do it real time you can say you know this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is flowering now I can see that it's
gonna finish up early I can see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna avoid you know the weather
I know that's coming in late October and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the one that I'm gonna select to
pollinate but just you know make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not compromising what you you know
the most important thing I think is the
[SPEAKER_00]: varietal that you're going after and those
traits the turpins and the the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like beautiful buds which I love
you know frosty trichome coated buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another important factor obviously
not to ignore but um you know sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: those things aren't necessarily exactly
related like the frostiest buds are not
[SPEAKER_00]: always the ones that test highest for THC
or whatever so you know I think those
[SPEAKER_00]: those are all important things but
essentially you can you can change things
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think as we go into this autoflower
discussion next I'm holding back on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that I think are relevant to
that too because that's an obviously those
[SPEAKER_00]: are you know I don't even want to say
early but that's that's a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal but there are what we call
heterozygotes which is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of both of those
characteristics that pop up and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to take traits that you like and in a
photoperiod type and transpose them onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto type or or have a heterozygotes
which sometimes lands right in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: so so then let's let's leave that there as
a nice little tasty bit to encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: people to come back for second set and go
ahead and take our first short break
[SPEAKER_03]: you're listening to shaping fire and my
guest today is Nat Pennington founder of
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt seed company one of the reasons
why no-till cannabis growing is so valued
[SPEAKER_03]: by farmers is because the mycelium
networks in the soil remain established
[SPEAKER_03]: from year to year and we know these fungal
networks are essential because they are
[SPEAKER_03]: the nutrient superhighways that extend far
and wide in the substrate to feed your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants the trouble with growing in new
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_03]: it takes most of the plants life just to
create these mycelium highways dynomyco
[SPEAKER_03]: endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant reduces
that time and gets your plant eating a
[SPEAKER_03]: wider array of nutrients faster and it's
three times the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_03]: current leading brand in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation this new product called
dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
[SPEAKER_03]: research and trials at the Volcani
Agriculture Research Institute in Israel
[SPEAKER_03]: it has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: since the product first arrived here last
year you may have already even heard about
[SPEAKER_03]: dynomyco by its original name dynomyke now
dynomyco is available at grow shops and
[SPEAKER_03]: online in the united states for the first
time i love using dynomyco to both speed
[SPEAKER_03]: up the growth of mycelium networks in the
soil but also as a bio stimulant to make
[SPEAKER_03]: clone cuttings more virile you can see
side by sides showing the comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: growth on their instagram at dynomyco if
you demand reliable growing results and
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate the importance of an active
root zone in creating a thriving plant i
[SPEAKER_03]: encourage you to check out dynomyco at
dynomyco.com and find out where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get yours that's d-y-n-o-m-y-c-o.com
whether you are starting with new beds or
[SPEAKER_03]: pots or if you want to add some zing to
tired soil choose dynomyco to maximize
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant's potential dynomyco
endomycorrhizal inoculant living soil and
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative cannabis agriculture are
surging in popularity and to implement
[SPEAKER_03]: these biological solutions real science
education is vital if you are interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in all things probiotic growing you will
probably want to attend this year's
[SPEAKER_03]: science of organic regenerative cannabis
cultivation conference for the third year
[SPEAKER_03]: in a row co-founders joshua rutherford of
dutch blooms and leighton morrison of
[SPEAKER_03]: kingdom aquaponics have lined up an
incredible array of educators with all new
[SPEAKER_03]: content for the traveling event they're
calling it version 2.0 going deeper down
[SPEAKER_03]: the rabbit hole this year's teaching staff
includes elaine ingham on soil biology
[SPEAKER_03]: chris trump and wendy cornburg talking
korean natural farming kevin jodry on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis genetics kelly and josh from
dragonfly earth medicine suzanne
[SPEAKER_03]: wainwright the bug lady chip osborne on
soil chemistry and many other thought
[SPEAKER_03]: leaders rotating in and out for different
cities so consult the website to know who
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically is coming for each location
there will be a breeding panel a q and a
[SPEAKER_03]: panel with the entire teaching staff and
on saturday night there will be a bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: hash discussion as well joshua has built
in significant informal time for you with
[SPEAKER_03]: the teachers the teaching staff is just as
excited to work with you as you are about
[SPEAKER_03]: attending there is also no advertising
during the event the only vendor booths
[SPEAKER_03]: are for cannabis seed breeders your
tuition is what's paying the staff so they
[SPEAKER_03]: all be present and attentive to you not a
corporate sponsor even better the
[SPEAKER_03]: conference is not just for folks on the
west coast humboldt california is hosting
[SPEAKER_03]: one event for sure but the show is going
on the road to vancouver british columbia
[SPEAKER_03]: portland maine and whitmore lake michigan
get out your pen now because i'm about to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you the website this is a fabulous
opportunity for you to hear from an array
[SPEAKER_03]: of nationally recognized top shelf soil
educators all in one place not only that
[SPEAKER_03]: this isn't just beginner stuff like you
get at most conventions this is an
[SPEAKER_03]: intensive for people like us who totally
nerd out on the rhizosphere and growing
[SPEAKER_03]: and living soil and if you attended last
year be assured that this year is not
[SPEAKER_03]: simply a repeat of last year every speaker
will present different material than they
[SPEAKER_03]: did last year the website is regenerative
organic cannabis dot com that's
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative organic cannabis dot com this
year tickets will be limited in number to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve the intimate experience and will
only be sold in advance online there will
[SPEAKER_03]: be no ticket sales at the door so don't
wait and miss out on your chance to attend
[SPEAKER_03]: this important gathering of the
regenerative cannabis community cut
[SPEAKER_03]: through all the misinformation out there
and don't miss this opportunity to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: real soil science regenerative organic
cannabis dot com this message is for folks
[SPEAKER_03]: who grow cannabis i'm talking to home
growers patients and commercial growers
[SPEAKER_03]: too i'm probably talking to you when you
plan out your next growing cycle be sure
[SPEAKER_03]: to check out humboldt csi seeds at
humboldt csi dot com kaleb inspecta and
[SPEAKER_03]: his family have lived in humboldt county
for over a hundred years for the last 40
[SPEAKER_03]: years three generations of his family have
cultivated extraordinary sense of mea
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in humboldt mendocino and trinity
counties because of his lineage and the
[SPEAKER_03]: hard-earned experience that comes from
growing up smoking and sifting large
[SPEAKER_03]: populations of cannabis plants in northern
california the seeds you'll cop from csi
[SPEAKER_03]: will be winning genetics based on
long-time heavy hitters and updated and
[SPEAKER_03]: resifted to bring out new and exotic
traits and better yields go ahead and ask
[SPEAKER_03]: around kaleb also known as inspecta and
pirates of the emerald triangle is a
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder's breeder he reaches way back and
works with significant strains recreating
[SPEAKER_03]: them in new and interesting ways that
you'll love as a toker and a grower as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as offering you some surprises that
will delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators humboldt csi goes a further
step and selfs all these chemovars so you
[SPEAKER_03]: know all the seeds will be female these
are not experimental feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: humboldt csi releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_03]: will show in your garden folks grew quite
a bit of csi humble ginex last year here
[SPEAKER_03]: on vashon island and everyone was pleased
the patients had beautiful female plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and didn't have to call half of their
garden as males the folks growing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: fun of getting high grew colorful flowers
with exceptional bag appeal and great
[SPEAKER_03]: highs and breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack which gave them a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypic choices take a moment right now
and visit humboldtcsi.com you'll find an
[SPEAKER_03]: up-to-date menu of both feminized and
regular lines along with photos and
[SPEAKER_03]: descriptions that's humboldtcsi.com
welcome back you are listening to shaping
[SPEAKER_03]: fire i'm your host shango los and our
guest this week is net pennington founder
[SPEAKER_03]: of humboldt seed company so during the
first set we were talking about short
[SPEAKER_03]: blooming regular of seed varieties and for
a lot of people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: short blooming cycles people are those
same folks have been getting more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in auto flowers because they
meet a lot of the same needs for you know
[SPEAKER_03]: patients and home growers and commercial
growers who all really need to get done
[SPEAKER_03]: and out before before the bad weather
starts well today there's the second set
[SPEAKER_03]: here we're going to talk about auto
flowers so so nat you know i know that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have got two auto flowers in your catalog
this year which tells me you've probably
[SPEAKER_03]: been messing with them for a few years and
you know a lot of us get a lot of flack
[SPEAKER_03]: from growers who like big cannabis trees
and these are a lot of the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: respect you and and have liked the
cultivars that you brought to market and
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm a pretty public proponent for auto
flowers for people with certain needs you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what has been your motivation to go
ahead and explore auto flowers when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're you know you've been serving
these other folks who like big trees for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long well i i do have to say that i
love big trees and that's been sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: classic uh emerald triangle or even like
the kind of the whole northwest you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been growing trees for a long time
and gosh back in the days when it was you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we had sort of these quasi guidance
from from the you know the state or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the police that you know you
could do 99 plants or whatever it was we
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be like just a personal challenge
like 99 trees make them as big as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: yep and you like would look at google
earth and you'd be like now is that an
[SPEAKER_00]: almond orchard or a cannabis i can't
really even tell but um yeah so you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: i miss those trees because these days it's
there's not a much motivation to do things
[SPEAKER_00]: that way there you have these you know
rules basically you've got square footage
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh you can have as many plants as you
want inside of that square footage so
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes production does increase when
you know you're doing things that way so
[SPEAKER_00]: um autos i think in a lot of respects just
completely changed the whole paradigm and
[SPEAKER_00]: why did we start breeding them well i
think you know my top answer would be
[SPEAKER_00]: basically it was curiosity that that drove
me to start playing around with autos and
[SPEAKER_00]: i've learned that you know even though
humboldt is obviously world renowned for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a great cannabis that uh if we
just think that we're doing it perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: well and we don't have anything to you
know that that we could be learning from
[SPEAKER_00]: others then that's you know not gonna do
us any favor so you know got some auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seeds gave him a try wasn't
initially you know thrilled like i and i
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the general sometimes the the
preconception or the stereotype around
[SPEAKER_00]: them and so you know it was a challenge to
say hey let's maybe see what we can do and
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if we can change it and and i
think as i mentioned earlier i've always
[SPEAKER_00]: been really amazed at how malleable the
species is and how you know much of our
[SPEAKER_00]: own influence we can have on the evolution
of the plants and things like that how how
[SPEAKER_00]: they change for us and with us so yeah
autos it's really it's unbelievable just
[SPEAKER_00]: with our own breeding projects and looking
at quite a few different auto cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: making crosses and then making selections
you know it it only took two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: years before i was i think last year was
when we came out with our first you know
[SPEAKER_00]: fully endorsed auto line that was in our
catalog and available uh for folks
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever but you know maybe the year
before that we were kind of test running
[SPEAKER_00]: some locally with friends in the community
and things like that but you know last
[SPEAKER_00]: year people were happy and this year we
were able to refine that you know during
[SPEAKER_00]: last year's breeding process and now we've
got two varietals that were really really
[SPEAKER_00]: endorsing and you know putting out there
then we made a bunch of seeds and the test
[SPEAKER_00]: results weren't exactly what we were you
know what we were thrilled with but those
[SPEAKER_00]: are available for folks who might want to
do you know i think it's that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a big field that would just be for uh
biomass or something like that so um yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so i think um there's a ton of potential
with auto flower and i think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be able to make that way
more conducive to um what people expect
[SPEAKER_03]: from cannabis these days so you know the
the thing a lot of people go for the auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers i mean you and i have talked a lot
about october weather and how much sun
[SPEAKER_03]: sucks at this point um and one of the
things people love about him is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can you know start them earlier in you
know may or june and be done by august or
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning of september and they they
finish when it's bright and sunny out and
[SPEAKER_03]: they've got these kick-ass terpene
profiles and um you know it's interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: to experience it from the grower side but
i'm assuming that there have there are
[SPEAKER_03]: some breeding intricacies that you have to
be aware of when breeding the auto flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: that you don't have to be aware of when
you're breeding uh regular seeds will you
[SPEAKER_00]: shine some light on that yeah well you
know one of the things was that uh i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that don't have a ton of
experience with autos are just like don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you cannot make clones so you
like our whole breeding process where we
[SPEAKER_00]: do phenotype hunting and um you know take
clones of thou i mean last year in 2018 we
[SPEAKER_00]: literally looked over 10 000 uh plants in
this collaborative phenotype hunt effort
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're able to take cuttings off of
every single one of them while they were
[SPEAKER_00]: you know still in vegetative form preserve
them and mark them from the field to the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone tray and it was a huge effort um we
may do it again this year we we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: only ended up doing 2500 but you know
that's still really significant and i feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like we kind of were able to focus even
more on those um so we did kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same result from a little bit of a smaller
batch but you can't do that with autos so
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're breeding auto because they'll
just there's no veg there or there is veg
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no taking a clone and keeping
that strain in veg so that you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: know have it kind of permanently you know
you couldn't put an auto flower into
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture for example because it
would you know flower inside the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and it could be ridiculous so
there's a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding constraints but you know you can
also cycle through breeding uh generations
[SPEAKER_00]: quick very quickly because you know you've
only got three months you only have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait three months before you might have um
your next generation and and you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: made significant improvement in that
period of time um so we look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: differently we're we're really doing more
of kind of this traditional breeding that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have done for years with things
like you know corn and Mendel's pea plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's neat because you can utilize a
lot of those uh methodologies and not kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of confuse yourself with the you know
keeping things clonally and breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: them but i do have to say there are
advantages to being able to select one
[SPEAKER_00]: clone out of 10 000 plants and then breed
with that i mean without a doubt that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a huge advantage and allows you
to progress really quickly in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: the trait expressions that you are looking
for so you know will we get autos that are
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable or you know maybe even superior
to photoperiod type varieties i think so
[SPEAKER_00]: and i i think in a lot of ways the
advantages that you get of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker turnover potentially um might
almost equal out with the the
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of not being able to choose
but it may take a little while before
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to make things that are quite
as uniform um in their very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions so you know if you've got a
field of a few thousand auto flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pollinating and you're going out
there and now you're choosing the very
[SPEAKER_00]: best one out of that field um you're not
able to take a clone of it and keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know put like basically cross
either self it or cross into it and and
[SPEAKER_00]: create like a really stable homozygous
line for those specific traits but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you can actually have a big field
like that and you can hone in on one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if you are pollinating you can
select the seeds from that plant and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got at least a population that you
100 percent know you know is likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: display that trait that you're you know
the the attractive trait that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: after maybe you know at least 25 percent
of the time and then if you back cross it
[SPEAKER_00]: again you're going to get 50 and so on and
so forth so um if that makes sense yeah it
[SPEAKER_03]: does and it's interesting too to hear you
talk about you know the traits that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to lock
[SPEAKER_03]: down because you know a lot of folks do
many if not most because we're still in
[SPEAKER_03]: the early days of auto flowers and they're
they're they're very useful for particular
[SPEAKER_03]: types of patients and for for particular
home growers and for particular commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: folk but they're they're not for everybody
nor are they designed that way but here's
[SPEAKER_03]: my question for you you know one of the
things I like about you is that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: just have all of your staff in the front
of your booth selling seeds you are there
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself and you're talking to your
customers and you are you're you're
[SPEAKER_03]: explaining them how the seeds are going to
work best for their life so you've spent
[SPEAKER_03]: you know some shows now selling these auto
flower seeds what is the response that you
[SPEAKER_03]: are seeing from people who are looking for
auto flower solutions do you think that
[SPEAKER_03]: enough people know about them now that as
somebody who makes seeds and puts them out
[SPEAKER_03]: to the people that people are coming to
you and going hell yeah auto flowers are
[SPEAKER_03]: you seeing that yet or is this mostly just
heads still you know I'd say it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a mix basically we're seeing folks
that a lot of it is folks that are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know looking to do it in industrial type
cannabis agriculture in California and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's I think that it's going to
change things a lot the way that that
[SPEAKER_00]: autos allow plants one of the really
things I think it's really positive about
[SPEAKER_00]: it is I think it does have the capability
of reducing the environmental impact and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me wrong like I don't believe
that cannabis has very much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impact because you know
compared to the big ag that we have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Valley is you know a lot I mean
it's gotten this kind of misplaced
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotype as in especially here in
Humboldt for some reason and and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been a part of the Humboldt's
environmental movement my entire adult
[SPEAKER_00]: life and can honestly say that there has
been major impacts that you know pre
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that are still you know not
healed up but I'm always looking for ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to lessen impact and I think autoflower is
is a good way to do that particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: places like the Central Valley where there
actually is a major shortage of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: we do have wildlife that's suffering and
teetering on the brink of extinction so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like really good outcome of of
autoflower types I think for the hobbyist
[SPEAKER_00]: grower that people have more of an
opportunity to be able to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're bringing this autoflower
trait into the mix because you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put it in a small pot even if you live
in an apartment and if you have a balcony
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually still harvest your own
cannabis which I love I mean as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're a company that does service you know
this growing industry which I still you
[SPEAKER_00]: know think of it as a community but
there's no doubt that that there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that's developing and you know we
do service that but what I really enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: most about what we do is interacting with
small farms and hobbyists and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like grow your own kind of people and we
have quite a few people that are that are
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with autos and and having a
really good experience just in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard even in the coastal climates and
Humboldt it it's a totally different story
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know there actually are there
is a period of time here in Humboldt on
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast where Humboldt's famous for
cannabis but that's like the inland is
[SPEAKER_00]: where that has always come from but we
have this fog layer and in the urban area
[SPEAKER_00]: of Humboldt which is like really where
most of the population is it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest place to grow cannabis because we
get fog every day that's why we have
[SPEAKER_00]: redwood trees and things like that and but
people you know it's Humboldt so people
[SPEAKER_00]: still love cannabis so they're here you
know growing it and we we love that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: now offer them something that they can
harvest in late July or early August when
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt is actually at its sunniest and
they have a great experience with it which
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we want we want folks to have a
good experience and and even indoor too
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you can leave your lights on 24
hours if you want and our auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: will still flower and you'll still get bud
and so while you know you're still kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: using a similar amount of electricity you
know maybe you're using a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: water and you're not taking up so much
space for so long and you're probably kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of increasing the amount of flower that
you're getting for that electricity that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting in so yeah I think it is
advantageous in a lot of ways and you and
[SPEAKER_03]: using that particular example about the
having the lights on you know whether it
[SPEAKER_03]: be 16 18 or 24 hours one of the thesis of
feedback I get back from people all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time they're like oh it just turned my veg
room into a room that yields flower right
[SPEAKER_03]: because I had all this extra room in my
veg room and and now people can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: run autos there and certainly that helps
with resources more than more than
[SPEAKER_03]: anything it's a huge advantage to the
grower yeah and you know you're planting
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed every time which you know that
alleviates the need to have you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nother space to keep moms alive or
also it alleviates the need to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics to and from too I mean you know
all people I say cannabis has been sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of pesticides well I don't
necessarily think that's the case I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: know for a fact that the standards that
were held to here now in California and in
[SPEAKER_00]: most legal you know with licenses and all
that stuff you literally there's no other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crop in the world that is as
clean as what we produce because it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the most rigorous testing in the
world they have baby formula that isn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: pure as our cannabis but anyway you know
growing from seed not having to when when
[SPEAKER_00]: there were problems with pests it was just
basically because you know essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody found a good cut they shared it
with their neighbor and their neighbors
[SPEAKER_00]: shared it with the other person and and so
on and so forth and and undoubtedly one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those people might have had a infestation
some bugs and and then those bugs hitched
[SPEAKER_00]: a ride over to the other place and so on
and so forth and so that was like how we
[SPEAKER_00]: spread pests and pathogens historically in
the cannabis industry and you know of
[SPEAKER_00]: course some people were willing to
compromise their maybe their morals or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they didn't have the greatest one
morals they're spray these really nasty
[SPEAKER_00]: things on it and so because auto flowers
there's really no you're not never gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're much less likely to take a plant
from one grow to another grow you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely you're just gonna sprout some
seeds right inside your grow then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all the much less likelihood of
getting something from another you know
[SPEAKER_00]: passing around these pests and pathogens
so I actually really like that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been I've been talking about autos
for I know better part of a year now maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more than a year talking to
people about it pushing them and I had
[SPEAKER_03]: never really considered that they're more
hygienic because we're not moving our cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: around as much because they're all from
seed that's a really good point yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely and you know I think we were
starting to talk about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: species how it's a malleable species and
you know I sometimes don't love the
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology of plant breeding and biotech
terminology but what you say is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're improving you know this is an
improved varietal over what it was before
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know don't get me wrong like I
love landrace I think we have to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds we can't let these classic and
original cannabis varietals disappear
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why we keep like a really really
robust seed bank here and humble and there
[SPEAKER_00]: should be that kind of an effort
everywhere but you know we are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: still improving things for what what it is
that we want to see and if a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: just flowers no matter what you do if and
that starts flowering a month after you
[SPEAKER_00]: sprout the seed and then lo and behold the
flowers are just about finished after 90
[SPEAKER_00]: days from sprout to finish or even shorter
sometimes and if that is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: really gives certain advantages like the
ones that we just discussed I mean they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be good for just getting more weed
they might be good for the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: they might save money and energy or maybe
they're cleaner I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anything wrong with that and particularly
you know I'm not talking about going in
[SPEAKER_00]: and splicing genes or even editing them
with crisper or something like that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about real traditional
breeding practices where basically I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we got all of the food just
about that we enjoy today for like the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we grow at least and you know
that's gonna happen and I think it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of fun to be a part of that plant
you know and seed improvement and with
[SPEAKER_00]: autos I've it's it's crazy how I've just
been able to see you know taking an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and crossing it with you know like
a strain we did last year we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: vanilla frosting strain and it's a higher
THC one and it's got this beautiful smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know really attractive strain and
you know we're moving that towards being
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto flower strain just by crossing it
with similar types of autos and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening quicker than I ever expected so
you know it won't be long before we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to say look here's this auto
flowering version of strains that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: all come to know and love and it shouldn't
really there's there's nothing that says
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has to compromise the things that
we've come to love about those strains you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it doesn't like it for a blueberry
muffin we're also working on a blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: muffin auto and it has this you know it's
a strain that we created in 2008 or way
[SPEAKER_00]: back and it really smells just like
blueberry muffins and it's got pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: purple color and you know a lot of really
nice traits about it and and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's anything wrong with trying to make
that so that you know someone could get
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds and plant them in do it on
their balcony early in the year mid-may
[SPEAKER_00]: and then next thing they've got they just
you know plant it on their balcony and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use the little railing as a
trellis and then have their friends over
[SPEAKER_00]: and show them the plant it's a lot of fun
harvest and and then they've got something
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've you know created themselves
and I think everybody kind of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoys that more like I've always had kids
around in my life and you know kids it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get them to eat their vegetables
right and so we I we'd always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and I always found that if you get
the kid out there and they're the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that planted the cauliflower or even worse
the Brussels sprouts and you know now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time and you get them out there
and they get to be the one that harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: it and everything boy do they love
Brussels sprouts when they and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's it's funny because when we
first started you know really having a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent distribution for the seed company
here you know I would be really critical
[SPEAKER_00]: of myself and and of our genetics and we
like have always been right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County and I always felt like oh
man and of all the places to you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's gonna think you know know that
these seeds aren't good or for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason it's gonna be Humboldtians because
they they know what to expect and what
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe didn't work out or whatever they're
gonna tell you so so so when breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: these auto flowers you know one of the odd
things about is that you're you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: take your your cultivar that you that
you're you know you want to emulate if you
[SPEAKER_03]: will and and you're more usually just
crossing into a ruderalis so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get that auto flower tendency but then a
lot of people are concerned about the the
[SPEAKER_03]: taste of the ruderalis which is you know
not usually awesome really tamping down
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor of the of the you know cultivar
that you're you're trying to make auto
[SPEAKER_03]: have you found that to be like especially
challenging or is it like I just take some
[SPEAKER_00]: time and effort well I think that that is
a really good point and I but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little bit outdated and there's
nothing wrong with that so if people are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening out there they're like that's
what I think I'm like look I totally get
[SPEAKER_00]: it but since we were working with just
like lowrider some of these original auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower genetics that are really clearly
you know kind of a subspecies of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because people always say there's like
ruderalis and there's sativa and indica
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think we all know that there's a lot
more to it than just that but if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the defining characteristic of ruderalis
then to me that is just the defining
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic and I've seen firsthand
that you can completely and totally
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate that one trait which is I'm gonna
flower literally a month after I germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna start going towards
flowering and and I'll be done in three
[SPEAKER_00]: months rather than whenever you know like
two months after the light changes to 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: or the photo period type so I do believe
that really that is a a trait that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely isolate and you don't
necessarily need to bring some of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: negative connotations to ruderalis along
with that so but that involves a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: selective breeding and you know
essentially if you cross a complete
[SPEAKER_00]: ruderalis with a blueberry muffin then
you're gonna have a whole bunch of progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them are not gonna be
ruderalis or auto flower type some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are not gonna be they will be but they
won't be blueberry muffin at all they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be more you know what you started with the
auto flower look which you know
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotypic description might be our fear
and that's like the humble word but loose
[SPEAKER_00]: loose flowers and you know not very
crystal II and just not dank so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't necessarily then what you're
gonna do is like you may only have 15% or
[SPEAKER_00]: even only like 5% that really captured
they that you just carried that one
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic which was the three months
start to finish and then took on and
[SPEAKER_00]: carried the characteristics that you do
appreciate about blueberry muffin and
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously that'll be the one that you'll
do your breeding with or you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower so you don't have a you can't
do the clone breeding so you've hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: that one has seeds in it hopefully the the
pollinator that you chose had also had
[SPEAKER_00]: those characteristics but it's it's a you
know it that's that's where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably get there's a lot of advantages
to molecular marker assisted breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think we're gonna talk about a
little bit later but you know you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: can and we do and we have done that just
through selective breeding traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding practices and and looking at that
the plants phenotypic expression but I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the advantage is that we've
essentially devoted all of our farms to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and selections and we've got
these isolated areas where we do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen that we you know assume or best
guess pollen is in the air and so when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going and doing selection and
looking through these populations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: have received seeds then we are able to be
you know to deem this one the best
[SPEAKER_00]: expression the one that captured the most
ideal traits of of the set of traits that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're working with and it's got to be such
a relief to get there after all that extra
[SPEAKER_03]: work so I want to talk more about actually
you hit on a whole bunch of stuff the
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry muffin the the genetic markers
and tissue culture I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: all that more but let's do it after this
next set break you are listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: shaping fire and my guest today is Nat
Pennington founder of Humboldt seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company cultivators who grow in living
soil are very particular on what inputs
[SPEAKER_03]: they use in their soil they educate
themselves and painstakingly create
[SPEAKER_03]: compost and nutritive teas to create
thriving soils that will produce the very
[SPEAKER_03]: best expression of the cannabis plant many
living soil farmers now believe that over
[SPEAKER_03]: time seeds become acclimated to the kind
of substrate they are grown in for example
[SPEAKER_03]: a seed that was bred in synthetic
fertilizers may not immediately know what
[SPEAKER_03]: to do in a living soil environment slowing
their growth and decreasing yield the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seed cooperative is a
different kind of seed bank the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seed cooperative only provide
cannabis seeds that were bred in living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and using probiotic growing
techniques that way when you germinate in
[SPEAKER_03]: soil the seeds genetics will recognize the
environment and immediately start
[SPEAKER_03]: interacting with microbes and fungal
networks these seeds are described as
[SPEAKER_03]: bio-intelligent the number of cannabis
breeders participating in the regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: seed cooperative is rapidly increasing
already signed on our
[SPEAKER_03]: with more being added every month these
seeds are regulars auto flowers and hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties a significant amount of the
profits go to cannabis seed preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: projects available to everyone do you want
to take every advantage that you can when
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in beautiful healthy soil then
consider buying your seeds from the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seed cooperative at
regenerative seeds dot com that's
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative seeds dot com growing
cannabis in greenhouses is taking over the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry an efficient and
effective blend of sunshine grown terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles and the controlled environment of
indoor greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_03]: worlds for many greenhouse operators
though building their greenhouse before
[SPEAKER_03]: gaining insight into how cannabis
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_03]: can be the start of a world of hurt eric
brandstead and his team at greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: advisory group have the experience and
technical know-how to help you avoid these
[SPEAKER_03]: pitfalls eric brandstead has been helping
cannabis growers find locations design
[SPEAKER_03]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade first starting in northern
[SPEAKER_03]: california but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the world he has an impeccable reputation
for both depth of knowledge and kindness
[SPEAKER_03]: and communication you can hear eric
explain some of the challenges facing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis greenhouses and how to overcome
them in episode number 41 of the shaping
[SPEAKER_03]: fire podcast no matter where i go in the
country good people with smart backgrounds
[SPEAKER_03]: still are making the mistake of building
without knowing cannabis and it causes
[SPEAKER_03]: them to burn through capital and time fast
everyone has their own failure point for
[SPEAKER_03]: some it is improper ventilation planning
for others it is surface temperatures of
[SPEAKER_03]: the building or the plants leaves or both
some folks that build their greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: from scratch make really basic errors like
placement of the greenhouse on the
[SPEAKER_03]: property or not understanding the natural
environment where the greenhouse sits some
[SPEAKER_03]: have even built a decent greenhouse but
are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_03]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields it's great
[SPEAKER_03]: when you learn from your mistakes but it's
even better when you learn from the
[SPEAKER_03]: mistakes of others when you bring on
greenhouse advisory group you will learn
[SPEAKER_03]: from the mistakes of their many clients
and you'll take advantage of the best
[SPEAKER_03]: practices developed by eric brandstead
over his years of working with clients
[SPEAKER_03]: just like you from location development to
choosing a builder and tricking out your
[SPEAKER_03]: new greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse eric will help you
[SPEAKER_03]: through it visit greenhouse advisory group
dot com to learn more and connect with
[SPEAKER_03]: eric and his team that's greenhouse
advisory group did you know that shaping
[SPEAKER_03]: fire has a fabulous youtube channel with
content not found on the podcast when i
[SPEAKER_03]: attend conventions or speak or moderate
panels i always record them and bring the
[SPEAKER_03]: content home for you to watch the shango
los youtube channel it has world-class
[SPEAKER_03]: speakers including kevin geaudry of
wonderland nursery talking about breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis for the best terpene profile
nicolas mamoud on regenerative and
[SPEAKER_03]: polyculture cannabis growing dr. sunil
agarwal on the history of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine around the world ben cassidy of
true terpenes on using terpenes for health
[SPEAKER_03]: in your everyday life reggie gaudino of
steep hill on the cannabis genome and jeff
[SPEAKER_03]: lowenfels on the soil food web there are
several presentations from dr. ethan russ
[SPEAKER_03]: on terpenes and the endocannabinoid system
and even my own presentation on how to
[SPEAKER_03]: approach finding your dream job in
cannabis and why we choose cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: business even though the risks are so high

newsletter welcome back you're listening
[SPEAKER_03]: to shaping fire i'm your host shango los
and our guest this week is nat pennington
[SPEAKER_03]: founder of humbled seed company so nat i'm
really glad that we finally got about the
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry muffin cultivar more because
holy hell man it is crazy how exactly it
[SPEAKER_03]: smells and tastes just like that jiffy
blueberry muffin mix in the blue box when
[SPEAKER_03]: i first smelled it at moon time medicinals
in garberville it was like a time machine
[SPEAKER_03]: back to my mom's kitchen as a kid what was
your reaction when you smelled that very
[SPEAKER_03]: unique terpene profile for the first time
in your sift yeah so the way that that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened was really interesting because it
wasn't me or really anybody who was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally in the company that that pointed
that out it was just a trimmer that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know it wasn't somebody that that
we're really close with but we had been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this cross and this was really
the first year that we grew it out with
[SPEAKER_00]: you know looking through 20 or so
different plants and one of them did come
[SPEAKER_00]: out just amazing and we had all kind of
had our eye on that plan we were a special
[SPEAKER_00]: one right there but it was you know late
september night the plant was done earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: than a lot of the rest of them and we're
up there in the field and we're harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's right across on the other side of
the plant and he just harvests a big old
[SPEAKER_00]: cola and says man i can't believe this
smells exactly like a blueberry muffin you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that blueberry muffin mix and i said
no kidding you're absolutely right and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just named that strain and we always had a
like an ongoing strain naming little thing
[SPEAKER_00]: within our our group where you know you
get like prizes and things like that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up naming a strain so he got the
prize for the year and that was that but
[SPEAKER_00]: um you know i knew that that that you know
it was born unfortunately we did have
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of it because that's something
we've been doing for a long time we always
[SPEAKER_00]: started taking clones maybe in you know
early 2000 mid-2000s of every plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: we put up in our field and we were growing
these trees so it wasn't like that much to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep track of it was manageable and we got
to see the full expression of them so it
[SPEAKER_00]: was worth the effort but the blueberry
muffin then you know we just back crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: and back crossed into it and i think it
was like 2010 that we were finally able to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know feel confident that the seeds
should carry that expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry muffin kind of jiffy mix thing
and i don't always say if you make but you
[SPEAKER_00]: called it and i don't know if we've ever
even talked about it before but well it's
[SPEAKER_03]: blatant you can't like you can't not know
like if you have any experience with that
[SPEAKER_03]: and i dare call it cheap right like that
cheap blueberry muffin smell because the
[SPEAKER_03]: boxes are only like you know whatever a
dollar a box to get this muffin mix and
[SPEAKER_03]: and and that's the odd thing is like yeah
we there are smells of blueberry in you
[SPEAKER_03]: know across lots of phenos right or not
even more than phenos whole cultivars but
[SPEAKER_03]: this very particular version of the
blueberry smells just like that box and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's and it's unlike anything else and and
everybody who smells a jar of it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: their first response yep exactly it people
do you know note that it's that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial blueberry muffins and uh and i
don't i don't mind because that was what
[SPEAKER_00]: we were really you know that was what we
were honing in on was the the jiffy mix so
[SPEAKER_00]: you nailed it right there it's it's
totally i'm not saying that it smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: organic blueberries put in whole wheat
flour muffins baked at home and no no it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like fucking big fake blueberry muffin
totally it's it's it's more of a uh a
[SPEAKER_03]: breakfast cereal blueberry versus a
organic muffin blueberry you know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: right but their pellets they're not
blueberry yeah so uh so that's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: story about the trimmer fine it and bless
their heart so you know um i have come
[SPEAKER_03]: across two different phenos of it um there
is uh most of them seem to be like this
[SPEAKER_03]: purplish green color which is very
beautiful um but then the one that i saw
[SPEAKER_03]: in all of these gorgeous hugel cultures at
moon time medicinals in garberville they
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to have the the pure purple fino
which um i'm not sure if it was you or
[SPEAKER_03]: your daughter who commented on my
instagram uh where i posted a picture of
[SPEAKER_03]: this this cola that was like the size of
my forearm and the entire thing is purple
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's you know very little green
actually on it and and the comment that
[SPEAKER_03]: that y'all made was uh it was like wow
this is this is one of the purple ones
[SPEAKER_03]: most of them are green but they all have
got the same smell how often do you come
[SPEAKER_03]: across that that purple fino because i
would think that that's the one that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know regardless of the other attributes of
the plant people probably really freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: dig the fact that they've they've got a
fully purple plant yeah so you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: original ones that we were kind of the the
cuts that we've preserved and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've sort of had this purple but
not the dark dark dark purple but kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a a modeled flex of of purple and and that
is really the target one uh you know one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that i've noticed is one of the
harder things to create complete
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity in in cannabis is the level of
anthocyanin or purple that you get in your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and you know that's been somewhat
problematic because as we are now breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for folks who need to put together a big
batch of of a specific type and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to grow from seed you know having
strains that have different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: purple can be problematic because you know
then you might end up with a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit on the darker side or or you
know more more green and you know i always
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of caveat with like well that can
happen too i don't know if you've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: but i've seen that plants that receive
more light can be a different color than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side of the plant it's the same
plant but you know it has some darker buds
[SPEAKER_00]: on one side lighter buds on the other so
there's really no uh way to have complete
[SPEAKER_00]: and total uniformity and and that's a good
thing in my opinion i like that but um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know i think with blueberry muffin
basically we've shot for kind of this you
[SPEAKER_00]: know purplish green kind of look to it and
that's what we've been going for and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully uh most people are are finding
that trait well it's it was delightful so
[SPEAKER_03]: so let's talk a little bit about um about
tech assisted breeding so because um i
[SPEAKER_03]: know that you have moved into that
direction and while you know many of the
[SPEAKER_03]: corporate cannabis companies are using
tissue culture you're one of the few
[SPEAKER_03]: authentic california heritage breeders who
started to experiment and kind of judge it
[SPEAKER_03]: for its relevance what are your
impressions so far of tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_03]: are are you finding it useful or just
something to mess with you know i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if i want to i don't think that it's
i mean it does take some setup you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a hood you have to kind of have a
laboratory essentially to do tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture i don't know if everybody who's
doing it is you know kind of totally
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate or anything like that but um i
think that it certainly is attractive to
[SPEAKER_00]: uh investors because it's really you know
kind of sounds high tech and you figure oh
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a really good way of of um must be
a good way of doing things because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like we talked about before you hear
about pests and you hear about pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry and and
pesticides and pesticide testing um
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not someone really uses
pesticides you know they can just be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on some ground that either has an
ag operation nearby and even the most
[SPEAKER_00]: minute amount can make you fail a test and
so it is a big deal so i don't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not um what we found with doing
tissue culture in 2015 and 2016 was you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we kind of expected to have a lot of
advantages from it like you know okay we
[SPEAKER_00]: could build a a library of of genetics
that we like working with it would be much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to keep those genetics kind of
alive and well happy in tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to pluck them from the shelf
as we decided we wanted to use them for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and and really that is like one
of the most uh useful applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture in my mind in cannabis
because you know cannabis is an an annual
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and it's a fast growing crop that in
most agriculture would immediately go to
[SPEAKER_00]: like this is a crop that we're going to
propagate with seed and you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: already use clone and that's to deal with
often the male female was i think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: why that developed so much uh and then of
course the uniformity of the you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is always going to be as uniform as
it can be because it's good and ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go if you were to to actually really pull
those directly from tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know basically plants that are in
tissue culture are very small often and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you either have to root them while they're
in tissue culture or pull them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then root them which is really hard
because they're you know there's a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little x plants and um that's tricky so
it's it doesn't seem like to me like it
[SPEAKER_00]: works for mass propagation but and and i
think most folks that have gotten into
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it have kind of realized that but
it's wonderful for cleaning up individual
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and then once you've got the
genetic pathogen free and completely pest
[SPEAKER_00]: free obviously um you're then able to
maybe maintain a very clean nursery so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you know i kind of tend to think if
you're doing tc and then just bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out of tc and then propagating them
in a in a nursery that maybe is partly
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors or has a lot of ventilation or
whatever that you're kind of negating all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the uh all of those benefits that
you're getting from tissue culture but but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're you know cleaning something up
there's been a lot of of talk and research
[SPEAKER_00]: done recently on something called the
hoplatin diploid virus which is aka
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise known as dudding and uh you know
like darkheart nursery has you know
[SPEAKER_00]: basically developed a cure for that which
i don't we didn't really have that before
[SPEAKER_00]: but the the cure involves putting the
plants through tissue culture and and
[SPEAKER_00]: really only taking the apical meristem
which is millimeter like even smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of plant and i i don't know if i'm
supposed to say exactly but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little process that that they put that
piece of a meristem through and then from
[SPEAKER_00]: there you know they've seen using pcr
which is like a genetic you can pose a
[SPEAKER_00]: question like is this carrying this
pathogen and polymerase chain reaction or
[SPEAKER_00]: pcr will give you an answer yes or no and
they put it you know through that test
[SPEAKER_00]: before the process and the answer is yes
and then go through apical meristem tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and the process that they add to
that and then the answer is no so those
[SPEAKER_00]: are things that are amazing that
capabilities that tissue culture has but
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a a cost saving way to do
propagation i would have to say probably
[SPEAKER_03]: not that's one of the things i'm noticing
uh throughout our our chat here today is a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of this stuff um you get into not
because you necessarily need it for your
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding because you've been breeding for
you know you you learned breeding old
[SPEAKER_03]: school style which took a lot of time and
a lot of effort and a lot of listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant and being with the plant and the
in the garden and now we've got all these
[SPEAKER_03]: new technologies to assist and you know
some of them are more helpful than others
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the genome so how are genetic
markers helping you to do traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding more successfully yeah so we are
doing some genetic marker assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and you know a bunch of people
are gasping but like the distinction is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important and and i'll just get out ahead
of that right now hopefully and say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know humboldt seed company is very
we're actually scared that that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: so much biotech interest in this precious
plant that you know we feel like has this
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful amazing cultural significance in
humanity we've evolved with it it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important and i know for a fact that folks
are out there doing both genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering and genetic modification and
genetic engineering is crisper which you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before where you can just you
know you just change the code of a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you can like knock out cannabinoids for
example you could say uh i don't want any
[SPEAKER_00]: cbd in this plant i'm taking that code out
or um add code even but genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: modification more like bringing dna from
another species and splicing it in and
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them essentially that's engineered
cannabis or modified cannabis and we at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldt seed company 100 support or we're
actually pushing right now for legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: in california to have mandatory labeling
for any cannabis that is modified or
[SPEAKER_00]: engineered and we feel like this is
incredibly urgent we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: support from people and i'll caveat that
with we're not like coming out and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that we think that it should be banned i
mean even if we did i don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that is likely because
we've seen what's happened with food crops
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've seen what's happened with uh
even animals now it hasn't gotten a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: traction because there's certain things
that that genetic engineering and
[SPEAKER_00]: modification can actually it could save
lives it could you know that's another
[SPEAKER_00]: argument i don't want to get into it but
what we're saying is that we want cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to be mandatory to have it labeled and
especially when that comes to genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: because what we see coming is these
cultivars getting out into the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: community cannabis is different than any
other plant in the world i would venture
[SPEAKER_00]: to say people fucking love breeding
cannabis they love smoking it they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in cannabis than i mean think
about it like what other plants are there
[SPEAKER_00]: i mean i know there's a bunch of people
that are really into breeding dahlias i
[SPEAKER_00]: know that all kinds of species are there's
a community around them it's still it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still pales to cannabis it pales it
totally pales so this is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: like let's we i think we've lost that
opportunity with our food because i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're aware like mendocino a few
years back did get a county ordinance
[SPEAKER_00]: through that banned gmo and but you know
there was no way to enforce it you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: chevron in latinville and it's all gmi so
there it wasn't an enforceable or a
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic thing as much as what we're
trying to do right now which is to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: say look cannabis is something that hasn't
really been engineered or modified so
[SPEAKER_00]: before it just gets completely you know
away from us and we couldn't ever keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track let's just say you know we're not
going to stop big biotech from doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing we don't even know whether
we're opposed to it or not or maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: participate it sometime down the road like
i'm not saying that i have either you know
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't ever want to see it happen i'll
never participate or i i love it i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working on it right now i mean we're not
but but i do think that it deserves that
[SPEAKER_00]: we deserve and that this community
deserves to know what is and what is not
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically engineered or modified right
on back to what you asked me about so the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic marker assisted breeding is a
different thing entirely and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: means so basically like i did a bunch of
studies on salmon when you know i still am
[SPEAKER_00]: a big part of these environmental groups
but in humble we were battling to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the the climate dam and save the salmon
runs and one of the things that became
[SPEAKER_00]: really evident to me was we were losing a
specific type of salmon called the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: run chinook and because there were no
there was no data on how different those
[SPEAKER_00]: spring run fish were from the fall run
fish that they were not protected at all
[SPEAKER_00]: so they could actually slip into
extinction without ever receiving an
[SPEAKER_00]: endangered species listing or any of those
things no protection no management at all
[SPEAKER_00]: so i said look i had to change this i
wrote a grant got funded found some some
[SPEAKER_00]: students and some you know people that
were getting their phd at humble state and
[SPEAKER_00]: at davis kind of tailored the grant for
that work and we started doing genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: studies on the salmon and lo and behold
there actually were specific differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between those fish that you could find
with something like pcr which i mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before it's basically a it's kind of like
ancestry.com if you were to say you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it is totally like ancestry.com for plants
it is yeah and and you know no one's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there like you know you submit some you
know a swab of your cheek cell or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: to ancestry.com and and no one's saying oh
you're you know you're messing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome because you're not you're really
just looking deeper into a organism to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out more about it like what its
history is what it's related to so on and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth and you can even like predict
there's predictors like you know is this
[SPEAKER_00]: person potentially need to worry about a
heart attack at a young age or cancer i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean if there's enough evidence that a
certain loci or allele in the genome does
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to have that you know those problems
like a heart attack or something then yes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably something that you should
think about and maybe you know treat your
[SPEAKER_00]: body differently but marker assisted
breeding is essentially the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically saying you're trying to
find markers like at at this allele you
[SPEAKER_00]: know this loci which is what we did for
the salmon you know we found greb 1l which
[SPEAKER_00]: was one loci that said this fish is either
going to swim back in the fall or swim up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring and we wanted to protect the
spring run because that as we were tearing
[SPEAKER_00]: down these dams which is this momentous
thing is like the largest river
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration project in the world according
to national geographic so i was like look
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't lose the fish that will inherit
that space i mean historically those were
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that went there we put these dams
in they are now teetering on the brink of
[SPEAKER_00]: extinction we got to figure out a way to
protect them before we lose them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have anything once these dams
come out which is going to happen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year or two we won't have anything to
go repopulate up there so we actually were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get the endangered species listing
through that that study and there's tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of similarities between like that i look
at the spring run and then at fall run and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm like you know auto flower photo and so
that's kind of what you know made me so
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with with the marker assisted
breeding it's like i had done this before
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole purpose was to save natural
resource save like our our beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and the wildlife here in
humble and uh you know now we can apply it
[SPEAKER_00]: to like all the good reasons that we were
talking about earlier to have auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and there's i i would really
argue with someone that said that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something morally or ethically wrong with
marker assisted breeding because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it doesn't even take a lot of
electricity to like the pcr machine is
[SPEAKER_00]: really a pretty simple piece of equipment
and the way you get the answer is with
[SPEAKER_00]: these gels and they just one of them glows
when you put it under a black light if the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is no maybe it glows and if the
answer is yes it does not glow and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's exactly what we do it's the same
thing as the plant sex tests that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available through all these different
genomics companies we've been using uh
[SPEAKER_00]: leafworks a lot lately and we've got this
feminized certification thing but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same concept and and really if you've
ever used one of those then in a way if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do breed then you've actually done
marker assisted breeding because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: used a marker that told you whether the
plant is going to be a male or a female
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know maybe that made it a
little easier for you to do your breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: project in the long run so i think that
one of the things about you know people
[SPEAKER_03]: hear the first two words right genetic
marker and then they they immediately jump
[SPEAKER_03]: to gmo when really it's it's really just
another analysis test like anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll get at any can i mean you know it's
more complex than than you get at most can
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis labs my my point is though they
are passive right it's it's you trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: read the plant to understand it it's not
invasive something like crisper is where
[SPEAKER_03]: you're actually going in and splicing and
editing the genome and then inserting
[SPEAKER_03]: genes that are not indigenous to the plant
or you know and and i think that it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: vocabulary that is off putting to a lot of
people more than the fact that you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh well we did a test to find out if this
particular particular attribute is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dna which makes it sound a lot safer yeah
exactly and i think that that is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: common misconception and you know if
people excuse me get to understand it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more that you know it won't be
quite so scary because it is exactly that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically screening a population
for this desirable trait that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and then you're kind of it's
it's a time saver as well like you're then
[SPEAKER_00]: saying you know all right we want this
trait so if we're sprouting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if we know which the marker for that
trait we can then take tiny snips of of
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue or like little bits of leaf and
submit it or do our own pcr and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: get a whole bunch of yes this one has it
and and no this one doesn't all right so
[SPEAKER_03]: this this last question i'm going to ask
slowly so you can take a sip of your
[SPEAKER_03]: harjata and uh and take care of that cough
so i'm going to ask it really slowly so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can have your sip so you know um
even though you've been you know doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this cannabis breeding for more than 20
years and and humble you know uh humble
[SPEAKER_03]: seed company has been around for that long
you're still a pretty young guy and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got lots of years of creativity left in
you but you know you you've talked to me
[SPEAKER_03]: and and you know earlier on this show
about how you know you've always got kids
[SPEAKER_03]: around in your life and and and you know
you've just shared with us that you're you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a biologist and an environmentalist
you think about generations of things so i
[SPEAKER_03]: can imagine that you've probably had a lot
of good folks working for you and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: probably thinking about the next
generation of people who are going to hold
[SPEAKER_03]: it down in cannabis and specifically
humbled cannabis right because you know
[SPEAKER_03]: more than just cannabis as an industry
humbled cannabis is an important american
[SPEAKER_03]: heritage so my question is is you know how
much energy do you put into mentoring the
[SPEAKER_03]: next generation of breeders and and and if
you you know if you're into that how do
[SPEAKER_03]: you go about doing that the goal with this
question is i'm hoping to maybe inspire
[SPEAKER_03]: folks because you know not only do we want
to inspire folks to to breed cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know there's a lot of work to
be done but there's gonna be people who
[SPEAKER_03]: come after us and we need to make sure we
instill them with our values before the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant becomes totally
commoditized sure absolutely well you know
[SPEAKER_00]: i i brought benjamin lind into the company
i don't even remember when but that was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early days and ben is is a huge part
of our breeding program a huge part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company so shout out to ben he's a little
bit younger than me but uh i i probably
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say that i exactly mentored ben but
you know within the company definitely i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ever really think of it as people
working for humble seed company or working
[SPEAKER_00]: for me or anything like that it's always
you know if i'm not making them excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they're doing then i'm not in
my opinion like being a good leader in the
[SPEAKER_00]: company and so that is exactly it you know
you have to not only mentor and teach but
[SPEAKER_00]: allow folks within the business to develop
their own ideas and nuances even if maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you've done it before and you
might say look i don't know sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to kind of just take an educated
guess at like sometimes it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to let people kind of try and
and experience the same failures that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've experienced over the years but yeah
i think it is really important i mean i
[SPEAKER_00]: started breeding at the through getting to
know people that i really really really
[SPEAKER_00]: respected and loved that were both
cannabis farmers and you know the beauty
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenomena of humble is that it was
never just a place where people grew
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful cannabis it was a place where
people worked together to grow wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis they worked together to embellish
community they worked together to foster
[SPEAKER_00]: you know these environmental movements
they fostered social movements social
[SPEAKER_00]: justice economic justice and that has been
a major underpinning of humble seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company ever since you know i first walked
into the courthouse so many years ago even
[SPEAKER_00]: before i knew it was going to be a seed
company you know it was basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: look how do we keep these hills alive and
one of the things it's a very rural place
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have to band together and that needs
to persist through this change that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing right now with it becoming
more of kind of this traditional economy
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got you know all these
pressures fiscal pressures let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: and and then now more obviously taxes and
you know the even the county itself as as
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive as as humbled i have to give it
to humble like it started out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: rocky but our county government is now
really understanding and embracing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the businesses the small businesses and
trying to you know help help us make this
[SPEAKER_00]: transition and so all the way from the
county supervisors to the the planning
[SPEAKER_00]: department to our local wildlife officials
to the old growers that you know have some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them have come sort of out of the the
hills and are now you know working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: license space some of them are maybe have
scaled back their grow a little bit just
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can stay in that sweet spot
of of having a growy but not a grow that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get red flagged by the because
you know it humbled it was it's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: harder now to grow cannabis and noble than
it was four years ago i mean four years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago we were having this influx of
everybody had heard you know oh you go out
[SPEAKER_00]: to humble and it's a green rush and make a
bunch of money and and to be honest like
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those people came out here they
all they wanted was to move here because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the money and and weed and it was cool
or whatever fell flat in their face and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them have now moved on to whatever
they're doing next somewhere else but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know really it has been those people that
were here because of the place and because
[SPEAKER_00]: and and really fell in love with this
community and and the tightness that that
[SPEAKER_00]: being in a more of a rural environment
creates you know you and i don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make us sound like you know we're a bunch
of rednecks out in the boonies even though
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing wrong with that but you
know we're we we've innovated a lot here
[SPEAKER_00]: too and coming together has made that
innovation you know it we've changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole cannabis community around the world
you know created so much stuff we
[SPEAKER_00]: innovated we've made our mark and i'm
super proud of that mendocino trinity too
[SPEAKER_00]: like i don't want to just be all humble
centric because there's so many great
[SPEAKER_00]: people in in the whole area here oregon um
but yeah we gotta pass that we gotta pass
[SPEAKER_00]: that community feeling down through and my
daughter i know you probably were
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to my daughter she's 21 years
old now and literally was on my back when
[SPEAKER_00]: i was out planting the first cannabis you
know like she's been there since day one
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we're really tight and um she she
does a lot with the company and she's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually really did you know has started
to guide some of the breeding a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know she has years of experience
under her belt and you know you just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: deny this plant loves experience it loves
um people that have that are familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: it and and a familiar touch as a as a
cannabis breeder i think is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important uh traits that you can have
as a breeder is familiarity i think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: you know a sign of some of the best uh
companies in any industry that they've got
[SPEAKER_03]: not only mentorship but also um you know
family companies when it gets passed down
[SPEAKER_03]: to generation and sure you know family
companies generation to generation they
[SPEAKER_03]: break too but there's something about
being totally immersed in any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: education which really gives you a much
more rounded awareness of it and and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: funny how you mentioned how you know the
the humble area the you know emerald
[SPEAKER_03]: triangle in general you know it attracts
people for lots of reasons and if their
[SPEAKER_03]: heart's not in the right place it also
spits them back out yeah and uh and uh and
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know um i think that's i think
that's okay yes i thank god right well you
[SPEAKER_00]: know people are people and uh we try to
live as harmonious with all of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it fortunately you're exactly
right fortunately it takes a certain um
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of person to to be here and you know
we've had i you know i've been here since
[SPEAKER_00]: 1995 uh that was when i was 18 years old
and you know traveled around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: since then doing the environmental stuff
but i never once thought to myself uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know i'm gonna live somewhere else it was
always this place is beautiful too but but
[SPEAKER_00]: i miss humble and i'll be back uh real
soon so well i don't think that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna top that as a place to end this
