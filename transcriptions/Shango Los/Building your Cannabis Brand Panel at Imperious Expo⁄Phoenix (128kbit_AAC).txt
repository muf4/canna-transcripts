[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everyone to the first expert
panel, the Imperious Expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Lowes, host of the
Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like listening to the top experts
in the industry talk about the passion
[SPEAKER_01]: that we all share in cannabis,
I encourage you to tune into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pick up flyers near the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to let you know that Dope
magazine is sponsoring a par-tay tonight
[SPEAKER_01]: on the roof of the Clarendon Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That starts at 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunshine, your favorite cannabis
professional friends, and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's on the roof of the Clarendon
Hotel at 6 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: This panel for the next 50 minutes is
establishing your brand's identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very pleased to welcome Celeste
Miranda, Amy Donahue, and Dachita Dawson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are merely highlights of each
speaker's bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to Google them or talk to
them after the panel to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, let's see, from stage left,
Amy Donahue is co-founder of Hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: Social, a cannabis brand agency
specializing in organic social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: customer relationships, and co-branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's based here in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: To her right is Celeste Miranda,
founder and CEO of the cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full service agency's specialties
include product launches, web design,
[SPEAKER_01]: and social media promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she is based in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to her right, Dachita Dawson is
president of Mary Jane Marketing with an
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise in building brand equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has an MBA from Rutgers Business
School and an undergraduate in molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: biology from Princeton, which I had to
mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's also president of the Southwest
Chapter of Minorities for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you three for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the format is pretty casual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the goal is we're going to present
the panelists with a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with a different one of
them each time, and then give all three of
[SPEAKER_01]: them an opportunity to comment on the
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll just go through and see how
many we get through in the next 50
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will also have about 10 minutes for
questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, let's start with you,
Amy, for the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Amy, do so many cannabis companies
simply come up with a name that sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: good to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just go for it, only to find
out later that it has some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you give a new cannabis
company so that they can increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: likelihood that they choose an effective
brand name right from the start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hire a professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't brand ourselves based on what our
personal passions are or things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: too close to home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we have to explain our logo to
somebody, then you're missing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So always hire a professional,
especially in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what the trends are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do it too personal,
again, nobody's going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to appeal to a broad
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would add on there, too, remember to
keep it catchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our term in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you make it memorable when you make it
catchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep a catchy name a lot of times if
it's two words.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first word and the second word
starting with the same letter works real
[SPEAKER_03]: well for something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in addition to that, remember to
make it trademarkable if that's a word.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you remember to make it
something that you cannot trademark just a
[SPEAKER_03]: typical word.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Clorox is Clorox.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, when somebody says bleach,
you think of Clorox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind, too, when you're
making one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just to piggyback the trademark
piece, I think you have to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a full search.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a digital marketer, first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always look and I find the www.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find it, you probably need to
start over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for the social media handles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because believe it or not, in addition to
trademarking, you run into the problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: even being able to build your brand equity
if you can't secure the platforms that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fitting your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you do abbreviate,
it can be very tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say even the experts sometimes
don't make the right decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, myself, name my company Mary Jane
Marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get confused for Team Mary Jane all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we fight for digital voice,
for share of voice, they probably are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting confused for Mary Jane Marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually looking to change my own
name to MJM Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's her first, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, it's a learning thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cannabis industry, people use
cannabis or tanna terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can be more clever, like hybrid
social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can be very catchy and still
hit at the fact that you're a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if I paid for hybrid social,
I did not create that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hired a professional brand to do that
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also agree that the best way to go is
to hire a professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you are trying to name your
cannabis company, it may be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: company that you've ever named.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have your own limited experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're using a brand
strategist, they hopefully have at least a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple dozen naming processes under their
belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that leads me to the next question,
where let's say that for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: the entrepreneur is not going to hire
someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've decided that their executive
team is going to do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all four of us, as brand strategists,
we've got our favorite exercises that we
[SPEAKER_01]: like to run our clients through to help
them come and to generate ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you each share one of your
preferred exercises that you run through
[SPEAKER_01]: with a client to help them generate names?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say first and foremost
to try to combine what you do with a word,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, that is trademark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can find those two segments,
I think that you've hit the jackpot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, if you can find an
identifier along with something that is
[SPEAKER_03]: unique, I think that's right in the alley
that you want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tim needs to create this
brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just talking a client.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do is just talk a client through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pretty soon you'll see that they
answer their own question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just getting them, leading them
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so talk it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can have these conversations with
friends, with family, with anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And talk through who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is your consumer?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you know it, through your own
discussions, you'll come up with your
[SPEAKER_03]: brainstorming of the best name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say what she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we basically take that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have tried to create a form
that allows us to kind of intake our
[SPEAKER_00]: customer or client with at least that
baseline of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we as a group do brainstorming
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the exercise, believe it or
not, is about literally digitally stalking
[SPEAKER_00]: our clients and the potential customer
base that they're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way I would say my team is
culturally hacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure out what the nuance
is about the particular target market that
[SPEAKER_00]: will lead us to the right words that will
incite the purchase ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I always
recommended to clients when I was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brand game was don't go with necessarily
your first choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come out with four or five that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do number two or number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do number three or number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get five that you could totally decide on
and then choose from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going from the first one that you get to
that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be great that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to create a company name that's got
staying power, you're going to do much
[SPEAKER_01]: better if you choose one from a group of
five that you're already in love with all
[SPEAKER_01]: five of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start now with the other,
Ashita.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already just kind of established how
to potentially go about coming up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a company's grand mark says a lot about
the company, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it plays a big role in how a company
responds to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you name a common mistake that you
see in logos and how to avoid it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm going to keep
it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying in somebody else's style,
if you will, is a common mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that, especially in the
cannabis industry, because it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: underground for nearly 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first pick on the lid is usually
biting off of a brand that already exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can name a few, but I won't put you on
blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that, ultimately,
that's just your way to get a cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: desist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already saw Girl Scouts kind of doing
that with the name of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the biggest mistake I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get someone come to me with a
brand logo that looks almost exactly like
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a playoff of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so cute and it's so clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: For not real life business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things that now I
would say stay away from buying from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else's style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Logos, you know, it's interesting because
my firm did a brand study a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago that was a big topic of
conversation about to leave or not to
[SPEAKER_03]: leave in a logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was so much discussion on do not
leave, to keep it mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get accepted by mainstream,
you know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did a study that we did for a
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a trial logo that had a leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a trial logo that did not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put the product into the dispensaries,
did all the packaging, design on it and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe it or not, the package with
the leaf, although it was an abstract
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf, sold almost three times more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to a logo, you know,
I understand the industry wants to go
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstream and I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also keep in mind that your logo
cannot be totally off from who you are or
[SPEAKER_03]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And try as much as you can to say who you
are via optics when you create your logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, another problem we see with that
is colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will use colors on the
color wheel that are right next to each
[SPEAKER_03]: other, which is technically a very bad
thing to do as well when it comes to a
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer visually grabbing what's off of
shelf space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember to try to use the colors that are
opposite on the color wheel, on the color
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see that works much better as well
in consumer space.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, don't use fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you pay $5 for something,
your brand looks like it's worth $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that not everybody has a
budget right up front to brand themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you really do get what you pay for in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of go a little bit more towards the
mainstream when I work with brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like stuff that's more tongue in cheek.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good example, this is, I'm from New York
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Howard Stern, when he was on FM,
he had to edit himself, but it was more
[SPEAKER_02]: fun to me than hearing him go all out on
Sirius.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you can hold stuff back and be
more clever, then say, hey, we're a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like that better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like the creativity of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no offense to anybody, but I kind of
think the leaf is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to reiterate that during the
last question, we mentioned going with a
[SPEAKER_01]: professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost always a good idea to go
with a professional, even if you just want
[SPEAKER_01]: the rubber stamp, the name that you
already think that you're in love with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to a graphic designer,
for goodness sakes, go with somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: a professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once your brand mark is in the
market, you can't take that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're starting a company that is
maybe not short on funds, but at least
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say conservative on how you're
spending your capital, that is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: place to spend your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you want to come out as a
quality product, if you want it to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: elegant, hell, even if you want to go very
edgy and punky or rock about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you still want it to be a clean design
that really stands alone by itself in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're really only going to get that
with an accomplished graphic designer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, since we've mentioned having an
expert to help you both with naming your
[SPEAKER_01]: company and with choosing and building
your logo, I would say there's a good case
[SPEAKER_01]: to have those be two different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very often, the person who's helping you
name may also have some graphic design
[SPEAKER_01]: chops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reverse really isn't as strong to
have the graphic designer help you with
[SPEAKER_01]: the naming aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the people who play vocabulary and
design at this level, they're different
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I also add that when you are first
starting off and you have nothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, brands and logos go
through iterations through the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at NBC's, what is it,
The Bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that because when you show it
through the years, it has transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Target Bullseye used to be an
executive for Target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, it's really just a
matter of inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's transformed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to be able to have
iterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have professionals like
ourselves come on top of things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may need to start it off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can remix it into something that's
a bit more elevated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, rebranding gives you more attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a party or some kind of
rebranding launch, which is going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: you more business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might even pick you up media attention,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when Pepsi rebranded their
logo?
[SPEAKER_01]: My gosh, they were everywhere in all the
brand trade journals for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: just simply changing their logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to start with Celeste
in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Celeste, there are so many players in
each cannabis niche, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction or retail, that competition is
really severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a strategy that you like for
setting a company apart from the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pack as far as the brand experience
goes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that also has to do with
demographics and where you're located.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these products can't cross state
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a product in California that
you're launching versus a product in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York, to me, that's a bit of a different
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're thinking about licensing
that down the road, you also have to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: that in mind because you're going to cross
state lines that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the initial branding, I would
definitely say that look at your
[SPEAKER_03]: demographic that has to do with who your
consumer is because that also has to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with your branding and your branding
methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: My firm has over 40 clients in four
different countries, and that alone is
[SPEAKER_03]: branding a huge nightmare because you're
branding so many different ways,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only for a state territory now,
but a country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is just very, very, very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look at where you're at as well when
you're branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Play to that consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have your consumer in New York is very
serious, fast-paced, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: California is much more casual,
laid-back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that in mind, especially because
remember, with most of these products,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're confined within your state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind when you're branding
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're branding, especially online,
because that's what I do, is to show the
[SPEAKER_02]: personality of the company in your online
presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your Facebook page or your Instagram
account, if you're a fun company like
[SPEAKER_02]: mine, a lot of that voice comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about, like Celeste said,
knowing your target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you selling to someone like me who's a
Gen X woman, or are you selling to a
[SPEAKER_02]: gentleman who's a millennial?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say if you're really,
really new to the industry, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell is my target audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I spend a lot of time doing with my
clients is really identifying the white
[SPEAKER_00]: space opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that in corporate America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for larger companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that way, I would say try to set up the
company for success is to actually look
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is the best opportunity,
where there isn't a competition and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's actually a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once you fulfill the consumer
need, it goes back to everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying, and you're showing it in a
fun way that's relatable to the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic, then you're set up for
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one of the interesting things
about cannabis, from what we've seen so
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis sales cycle, it's not so much
about getting new customers to come to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, because people come to cannabis
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis sales cycle is do you have
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, what it's about is competing
against the other folks that are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf next to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so be really aware about who's already
in the market and what they look like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and differentiate yourself from them and
think about who you want to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the end, there might only be
four or five different companies on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf next to you, and they are the folks
that you're competing against.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more thing on that too is that I
find that a lot of my clients who come to
[SPEAKER_03]: me or even call me about people are
thinking about launching brands,
[SPEAKER_03]: they haven't even taken the time to go
into a dispensary, hang out, just see what
[SPEAKER_03]: people are pulling off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what they're saying when they pull it
off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hang out for a minute in some
dispensaries and see for yourself,
[SPEAKER_03]: why are they pulling out this product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to the people there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them.
[SPEAKER_03]: People tell you more than you think if you
just ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ask them, what is it about that
product that you're buying?
[SPEAKER_03]: What made you purchase it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see that they tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely then take that and find a
unique selling proposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just twist yours a little more to the
research that you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to double down on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud tenders are a unique lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some things that you want to
take their advice on and some things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that they are experts on are
what people buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can think of no other thing,
for all of us as cannabis entrepreneurs to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask your bud tender, then which one of
these products do people pick up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one seems to visually excite them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is there a product that visually
excites them, but then when they read the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients or the strength or how it's
used or whatever, then they're less
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is incredibly valuable information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud tenders can be a focus group for
you that you can't get anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, a lot of people don't give a
bud tender the respect that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you ask them for their opinion,
you'll get a lot of opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all free and to your benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Celeste hit on this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's start with Amy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the entrepreneurs at the state
level are looking to eventually go
[SPEAKER_01]: national.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either they want to take their company
national or they're looking to get bought
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put together with a larger brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of advice would each of you give
to your client who needs to be competitive
[SPEAKER_01]: now at the state level in order to get
their revenues up so that they don't run
[SPEAKER_01]: out of capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also want to eye the bigger
national market that they're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: playing in yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they want to make sure that they're in
a position with their brand that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: get bought out and then put into a
portfolio with a bunch of other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: or brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, hire a trademark attorney right as
soon as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're going to be local for
another two or five years, you need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trademarked ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But second would be, if you're creating a
great digital buzz, once you go national,
[SPEAKER_02]: people are already familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this industry, I can't tell you how
many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, I saw you in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is a small industry still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are active online and you have
a great website and you come to things
[SPEAKER_02]: like these, create that buzz as soon as
you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to every networking group, whatever you
can to get your name out there locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be no sweat when you go
national.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say to, again,
try to make yourself as unique as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one brand that did that really
well was Lola Lola.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made, as far as their branding,
their look unique, their colors
[SPEAKER_03]: recognizable, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when somebody purchases you as a
company or merges or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: with what you've built, they're purchasing
the brand power that you've created,
[SPEAKER_03]: the recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just work really hard on creating that
uniqueness, that recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, don't forget the element of
quality and customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because no one is going to purchase or
merge with you if you have bad customer
[SPEAKER_03]: service or your quality isn't up to par.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all just about the marketing of
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the branding, branding, branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about the back door,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add that three different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is that an educated consumer is
going to be your best consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the person that's going to bring
more people back to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to really crafting what
your product launch strategy is locally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to leverage the digital space in
a global way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're really looking to provide
education, which is global, and means for
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy, which is also global.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is, I feel like when you
think about a national strategy versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: local one, you're looking at, are you
hacking into Main Street?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, for the people who are cannabis
consumers, absolutely, it is a case that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sells itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are a non-cannabis consumer,
meaning you have not used it in 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're the person who may have judged
your girlfriend, you're still using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're someone who used it as a
caregiver, and you're realizing that it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for my mom or it worked for my son,
and now I want to see how it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not necessarily just going to be
sold on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure, at the very
least, you're reaching that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it goes right back to
educating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will hunger and evangelize for you if
you do educate them and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you do what you did earlier and tell
my friend too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, that's how you wind up
proliferating that following and that
[SPEAKER_00]: reach on a national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was two things, but I think that's
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go right back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're talking about expanding
from the state level to the national
[SPEAKER_01]: level, locally, like Amy said,
you're going to be participating in all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your local events, your meetups,
events like this for the Arizona market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go to these things, talk to people,
and establish yourself and your reputation
[SPEAKER_01]: for both you and your pride at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're all looking for hopefully
getting either bought out or going
[SPEAKER_01]: nationally at some point, because that's
where the real serious dollars are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that brings us back to digital,
which all three of you are experts in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to toss this out there that
one of the things that I find that the top
[SPEAKER_01]: level cannabis companies are doing that
others are not, they're creating their own
[SPEAKER_01]: original content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of cannabis entrepreneurs,
they don't have time for social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just take whatever news story
is going around that day and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: repost that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's all that happens,
people end up hiding you because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing those same articles everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I always tell people is take
pictures of things that are happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: your company's world that gives you a
sense of authenticity and creates a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling that there are real actual humans
behind your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question along the same line
is what are some suggestions or even just
[SPEAKER_01]: a suggestion that you give your clients on
the digital side of how they can seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: a tangible, real human company through
their Facebook?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it starts with including yourself
in the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off as a corporate crossover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say I went from Target to THC,
so I'm not a typical kind of stoner girl,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was a corporate stoner in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off watching videos of Celeste,
actually, talk about marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I launched The Weedhead,
which is my platform that talks about how
[SPEAKER_00]: am I going to be a cannabis executive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of nowhere, in four months,
I had 13,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, where are you going to
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it starts with telling the story
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not enough stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take the same from one of
my favorite people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But facts tell and stories sell,
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the more you're able to
put your own story out there, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more authentic it feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made me want to then follow
Celeste's businesses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was followed with great
education about how to start it,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the advocacy piece, because we're
all in the community together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was hooked as her consumer,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's how social media to
me and digital space really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start with creating your own
content just by turning it on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other platforms that I've been at,
or I guess the last thing I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: events, I force people in our recession to
make a selfie happen, figure out what your
[SPEAKER_00]: hashtag is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag and praise Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it before you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I make you do it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But take out your phone and do a selfie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's telling the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Celeste, do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that, along with the same
lines, it's just to humanize yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of my clients with my social
media team, we have seven coordinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so funny because it can get
boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only so much news you can post,
so much education you can give,
[SPEAKER_03]: so much of all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, give those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, humanize yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're constantly telling our clients,
send us photos of you guys working in the
[SPEAKER_03]: office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us photos of you guys out at the
beach and have your product there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us photos of all these types of
things to humanize yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's very important,
too, as Shana was saying, to write your
[SPEAKER_03]: own content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That authorship is invaluable,
that SEO that it brings.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those links in and out when people rerun
your original articles are invaluable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one likes to write.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to write.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do because there's too much value in
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with too much value in,
you lose too much by not.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too much value in doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so take the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write.
[SPEAKER_03]: Optimize those articles for SEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't skip that, or you're missing out on
a huge portion of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just humanize yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll find it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivation picks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I post a cultivation picture
from a dispensary client, I get more
[SPEAKER_02]: engagement than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you and I have been in
cultivations, but everybody out there has
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they can see behind the scenes
like that and see the baby's room and the
[SPEAKER_02]: curing and the drying, seeing behind the
scenes like that, it's also branding
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure you have a professional
photographer do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it with your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one was, oh my god,
I can't remember what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cultivation picks, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But tender pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show pictures of your display case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, what if someone's on the
fence about getting their card because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're afraid of what it's going to look
like inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: As transparent as you can be is going to
help you brand the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since so many of us are in the
industry, a lot of the things that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: get used to, the end consumer is
definitely not used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's old hat now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, heck, I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember the first time I saw a male
plant giving off pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days, when did you ever see
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the males were immediately culled
early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consumer never got to see one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first time I saw one, and I finger
flicked it, a pollen one, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that, if you think about
what's happening, in your shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not it's a retail shop or an
extraction shop, whatever, or maybe your
[SPEAKER_01]: place of business, think about what you're
seeing that other folks aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all know how popular and how
much shared those big bags of nugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: that the extractors post.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just people where their eyes get
big, and they get all dreaming about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so think about what your company's
doing that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's probably the same things that
you geek out at with your own employees at
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take pictures of that stuff, even coring
pictures, and you don't have somebody in
[SPEAKER_01]: there like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your company continue to seem fun
behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Celeste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many companies find great success in
co-branding with another company to
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit both.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should a company look for in a
co-branding partner?
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely think that you need to be
able to cross-promote with partners who
[SPEAKER_03]: are in a relevant situation, as you are,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things that we love
doing at our firm, because of the amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of clients we have, we cross-promote them
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great, because we will drive
traffic to both of them, even more
[SPEAKER_03]: traffic, and get more followers and more
engagement, because we're cross-promoting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go to cross-promote,
look to get companies who are relevant to
[SPEAKER_03]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look to engage with influencers who have
more followers than you, or key followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tag them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use their hashtags, and cross-promote that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, if you have a product do
shots out to dispensaries, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_03]: that pays off in the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for that relevance in co-branding
partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think I have anything to add
to that, because that was a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always make sure you get permission as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some influencers are really cool with it,
because if they have a good person behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the scenes keeping track of that,
then they'll notice it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tag and cross-promote between
brands all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's also an in-store
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget your retail fundamentals that
you see every day in your typical Target
[SPEAKER_00]: or Walmart store walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cross-promote in that way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a product that goes in a
dispensary, you can make a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: headway with the number of units you got
going on the door if you work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary itself on promotions,
specifically to that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do so then by following up with
the support in the digital space,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, we've got something going on in
this particular place.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% off, 25% off, go there now at this
particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend getting it coded so that
people are able to track how much traffic,
[SPEAKER_00]: additional, incremental, that you may be
sending to the store for those type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-promotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're still kind of learning
yourself co-branding, I'm not really sure
[SPEAKER_01]: what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I learned it, I actually learned it
from Huff Daddy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hip-hop is the original
co-branders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put out an album, and then you have
all of your friends guest on your songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you buy the one album, but now
you're getting tastes of five or seven
[SPEAKER_01]: other artists on that same album.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you go buy Jay-Z's album,
and now you've been turned on to six or
[SPEAKER_01]: seven people, and it goes on and on from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do the same thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a grower, do a co-party,
a co-branded party with one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hey, Imperious Expo is co-branded
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I already pitched the Dope
Magazine party tonight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about Dope Magazine from
the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the Shaving Fire podcast,
so there's a co-brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all these different ways that
as soon as you think about people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene who you would consider allies,
and who you would like to have your brand
[SPEAKER_01]: mingled with, just go ahead and reach out
to them and say, hey, let's do something
[SPEAKER_01]: together and cross-pollinate our markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'd all agree that it really
works wonders to trade audiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so this is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're back to you, Dashida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the state level, what are your
favorite places to spend advertising?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a digital girl, but I do think
that the metrics for marketing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance across it is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that the biggest bet
probably for me is going to be first on
[SPEAKER_00]: cost per action, especially if you're a
startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost per action is based
