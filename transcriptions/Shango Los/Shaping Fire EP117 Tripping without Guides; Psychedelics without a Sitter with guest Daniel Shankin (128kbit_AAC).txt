[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How people are talking about psychedelic
mushrooms like simply everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, many of us had lots of mushrooms
in our subcultures growing up and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about mushrooms being
discussed on CNN and daytime talk shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are talking about microdosing
and others are talking about macrodosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone seems to be talking about
mushrooms to feel much more free to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss mushroom use and benefits
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common for the media to talk
about the importance of using mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_00]: a clinical setting or for psychologists to
suggest the importance of having a guide
[SPEAKER_00]: or trip sitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, there is a creeping
assumption that everyone should have a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic safety coach involved with
their self discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not of that opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, some folks should definitely
seek these types of support and it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: good that they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vast number of people don't
actually need a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are records of human beings using
psychedelics for over 9,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our species has a long and positive
relationship with the psilocybin mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you follow some simple but
important best practices, you or you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends can engage in psychedelic
exploration safely and on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our topic for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking psychedelics without a trip sitter.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this month's and all future
newsletter prize drawings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 117.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Daniel Schenken.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the founder and director of TAM
Integration, Daniel offers radically
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible and inclusive support and
education for people who are wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: transform, heal and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: TAM's integration circles and online
conferences enjoy a worldwide audience and
[SPEAKER_00]: much acclaim.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also leads the year long Mount TAM
Psychedelic Integration coaching program,
[SPEAKER_00]: training emerging leaders in the
facilitation of transformational
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Daniel as having incredible
insights about psychedelic integration,
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of psychedelics and a keen sense
of the importance of psychedelics as both
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation and for self discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across his social media channels
and started getting some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Daniel Morford from Heart Rock
Mountain, Canada introduced us and we
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly chose a date to pull together this
episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will
consider the differences between having a
[SPEAKER_00]: trip sitter or guide and going it alone or
with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will discuss best practices
for going into your psychedelic trip with
[SPEAKER_00]: a good mindset and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we'll offer some tips
on preparing for your trip, locations and
[SPEAKER_00]: things to do while you're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we will discuss
psychedelic integration, what that is and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make sure that you're able to bring
your lessons and healing from psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: back into your daily life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two important notes about
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I recently upgraded the Shaping
Fire Studio so all the episodes will sound
[SPEAKER_00]: even better than they already do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alas, I thought that I had all the
settings dialed in and tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point before we recorded,
I hit the gain and threw it off
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, my voice was recorded too
boldly and now clips a great deal
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel's voice sounds perfect though,
but I don't sound so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Shaping Fire sound engineer did an
excellent job making my voice listenable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, you'll hear my voice sound
crappy this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 171 podcast episodes of being my own
sound technician, I was bound to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: error sometime and that is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have adjusted the gain and taped it in
place now so we shouldn't run into this
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for your patience with the sound
of my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, neither Daniel or I are doctors
and we certainly are not your therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information is offered to add to your
own research and discussions with your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't take today's episode as
permission or instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, consult your local laws about
any plans you may have when considering
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire has a global audience and you
are responsible for understanding the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: in your specific area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your time is valuable and I've been
excited about doing this episode for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we get into it, let's go ahead
and repeat some of the disclaimers that I
[SPEAKER_00]: already mentioned in the introduction
because we want to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dear listener, we are not your doctor
or your therapist and we don't know your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be speaking in
generalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be taking our insights as
permission to do something at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage you to do your own homework,
talk to your own doctor, talk to your own
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual leader, and be aware of the
legality wherever you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that the audience is all
around the world at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here in the United States,
the psychedelics we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about today are schedule one drugs in most
places or everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be really aware about the laws in your
particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Daniel, I want to start with
the opposite of what the episode is about
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode is primarily focusing on
people who choose to do psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: either by themselves or with friends and
not using a counselor or a facilitator
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to make sure right off the bat
that we make sure people know that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not saying don't use a facilitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many people and for many goals,
using a facilitator is exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, maybe even vital to their healing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a trainer of psychedelic
facilitators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start out with that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the good reasons to
engage a psychedelic facilitator when
[SPEAKER_00]: someone chooses to do psychedelic healing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you might want a certain level of
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want a certain level of safety
and care that maybe isn't available with
[SPEAKER_03]: just friends or family or by yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might also want, when I say safety,
I mean, of course, like physical safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want you running off into
traffic, but maybe you want a
[SPEAKER_03]: psychological or emotional safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we know, psychedelics can really
occasion catharsis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: People have emotional releases.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have old memories resurface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might not be the kind of thing
that you feel comfortable talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: with just like your buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're with somebody who you've
worked with for some time, you've built up
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a therapeutic relationship and a
certain amount of rapport and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: already started to kind of like open the
doors to the stuff that's in your closet,
[SPEAKER_03]: it might do you really well to go deeper
into those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can allow a lot of kind of stuff
to come up and to be released and to be
[SPEAKER_03]: processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have somebody who's trained,
who knows how to hold space for that and
[SPEAKER_03]: knows how to reflect back and sort of
guide you into like a proactive direction
[SPEAKER_03]: can really come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be in this situation
where all of our walls are down and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: being very vulnerable and we're ready to
do work on something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we happen to be with somebody who
isn't the sort of friend that we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: want to share those kind of intimate
details with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we're approaching these
psychedelic modalities to heal,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the healing looks like bringing
up some pretty sensitive secrets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it can be messy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can even make things go weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't know if you've ever,
I'm sure your audience knows what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like to sit on an uncomfortable secret,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or to kind of have stuff that wants to
come out and wants to be seen,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you don't feel safe and maybe there's
shame or maybe there's anxiety or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: it is and you can't share it and things
can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things can go sideways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people are like, what's wrong with
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the whole vibe gets weirder and
weirder and weirder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can happen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're holding things back.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the flip side, I've talked to folks who
have a lot of experience with like,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's just MDMA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about MDMA for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've partied with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've gone to shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've gone to concerts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've gone to good times with their
friends in front of the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just always a chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a sweet time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they decided, hey, maybe I want
to do some more work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already familiar with this molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how it acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you take them out of the one
setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we should probably talk a lot about
set and setting tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you take them out of this kind of
friendly recreational setting and you put
[SPEAKER_03]: them in a therapeutic setting where the
space is there for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an entirely different medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden this person can
access things that again have been wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: and wanting to be seen and things that
have wanting to be acknowledged and loved
[SPEAKER_03]: for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can finally come out because the space
and the setting is there for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we will be talking a lot about
set and setting here just in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I want to hit before we
move on about the good reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: just some of the good reasons to use a
facilitator is that a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are drawn to psychedelics have pretty
serious pre-existing issues that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sort out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be schizophrenia or anxiety or
psychosis or a history of things that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to try to go on a healing
path such as this, it can get complex and
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps even mentally dangerous quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might want to have someone
trained in these areas present instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that weight of helping you in a
crisis situation on your friends or just
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure there's a host of those as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, we have the Renaissance
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: The psychedelic come up is going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this means is that there are a
whole lot of new people who may have never
[SPEAKER_03]: considered psychedelics before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm guessing, from what I know
about you and your audience and our mutual
[SPEAKER_03]: friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Daniel Heartrocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, Daniel Heartrocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of grown up.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are heads who have grown up with
psychedelic people and psychedelic
[SPEAKER_03]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I needed a friend of mine to sit
for me, I can call somebody who I've known
[SPEAKER_03]: for some time, for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'd be like, hey, I kind of want to
do this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just make sure I have tea and the
music's playing and I feel safe and stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy will be like, cool,
that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you do that for me next month?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've been through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you've got folks who don't have
that kind of community.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming from middle class wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming from nine to fives.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming from straight lace family
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, I don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any community like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they kind of need some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a facilitator can kind of fill that
role and also kind of guide them into the
[SPEAKER_03]: world of psychedelics, the world view of
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dear audience, we are in favor of
using a facilitator when it's called for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're going to focus on today is
when you choose to do psychedelics without
[SPEAKER_00]: a clinician or a facilitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are in favor of facilitators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often, sometimes the price is very
high getting into the thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes folks don't want to take a
psychedelic in a clinical environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not able to find a facilitator
that does something not in a clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps they don't want to have the
facilitator's energy mingling with
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves during the trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are good reasons to want a
facilitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also good reasons to choose to
not use a facilitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little beginning of the show,
the point is just to tell you that even
[SPEAKER_00]: though this show is about going it alone
or with friends, this does not mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are discouraging the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've hit that pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to say something else on that,
Daniel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also, again, you said the
disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to use the term sort of harm
reduction, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And education and benefit maximization,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is offered in the spirit of harm
reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one strange man's opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely suggest checking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing your homework and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show it for you all the best
I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited about this because we can
use this as a resource in the future about
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of friends and family or solo guide
to this sort of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shaping fire episodes are always quite
evergreen so that people can continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: use them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we're talking about a
handbook of growing cannabis or using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or making medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're talking about
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it by talking
about mindset and setting, which you have
[SPEAKER_00]: already brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much the cornerstone of drug
usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to start with the first part,
mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the factors in coming to
the psychedelic experience with a good
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about setting in a couple
minutes, but let's focus on mindset first.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we want to bring to the
psychedelic experience for their best
[SPEAKER_00]: practice results?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, can I take a step back and talk a
little bit about the history of set and
[SPEAKER_03]: setting?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a time way back in the 50s
when there were researchers who studied
[SPEAKER_03]: LSD as something that mimicked the
experience of having psychosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, oh wow, this molecule
creates a psychosis-like experience for
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we give it to them, they'll be
psychotic for eight hours and we can study
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, they would give it to
people and they would go psychotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: For eight hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were shocked to meet like
the hippies of Haight Street who had,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, their velvet couches and their
paisley shirts and their music and lava
[SPEAKER_03]: lamps and what have you, and their
willingness to dance and to be groovy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those people weren't going psychotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were having mystical experiences of
love and oneness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the researchers realized is that
this is dependent, these molecules are
[SPEAKER_03]: dependent on set and setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Advil, for example, works the same if
you take it on the mountain or in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beach or in an office or on a plane and a
train, you know, with a goat in a boat,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of decided, oh, it probably
just works like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just works the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they found is that if you put
somebody in a hospital and you strap them
[SPEAKER_03]: to a gurney and you put them under bright
lights and you tell them they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go psychotic and then you ask them really
probing questions with a clipboard for
[SPEAKER_03]: eight hours, then guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a psychotic person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do that without, I might go
psychotic in that situation without drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there has been this exploration
about what are optimal set and settings
[SPEAKER_03]: for particular results for particular
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you were saying, that might freak
me out even without drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain sets, certain settings and certain
sets are better for some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain settings are better for other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this journey of, you know,
hopefully if we're talking about healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: use, perhaps over time, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that maybe we're going slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we're starting with low dosages and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to set and set, back to mindset,
you're going to bring yourself with you
[SPEAKER_03]: into a psychedelic experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're bringing you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they call psychedelics,
for the most part, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The true psychedelics, non-specific
amplifiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what non-specific amplifier means is
that it brings up the stuff that's already
[SPEAKER_03]: there in a lot of ways, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's smooth, you know,
sometimes it does add that love and
[SPEAKER_03]: connectivity and that's really nice too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people say, oh, it made me anxious or
it made me afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have that in you already.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel like I was garbage and I
wasn't worth loving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, you've been carrying that around
for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get a chance to look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So educating people at least about that is
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are not so, and of course people
forget it of course all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you can sit with people and kind of
coach them on recognizing that that's one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the things that can possibly happen,
that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not so surprised when they come
face to face with their own stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: their own shadow perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's also important to recognize is not
only are you dealing with stuff that is
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially very, very old, but your
recent environment and experiences play a
[SPEAKER_03]: part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have been watching a lot of
election news, you know, you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: watching a lot of like fear-based news
before your trip, that's not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: help.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've been watching horror movies,
that's not going to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although if you watch the Lord of the
Rings trilogy, that actually might help,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The hero's journey, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're tuning yourself into like
archetypal forces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, good things that people
often do to get ready is not only they do
[SPEAKER_03]: various diets and so they might limit
their food, they might eat cleaner food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you don't have to process the food
on the journey and deal with that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might read more higher, higher vibe
literature, whatever that means for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to a student yesterday and
she was telling me that she really liked
[SPEAKER_03]: she, there's a graveyard near her house
that has a statue of Jesus in the Garden
[SPEAKER_03]: of Gethsemane and she reads the Bible and
she listens to George Harrison and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like she knows that works for her,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not, you know, I don't have
opinions on other people's religious,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just her religious beliefs,
that's her story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it is certainly, it's really high
vibe for her.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts her in a place of faith,
it puts her in a place of love and
[SPEAKER_03]: connectivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for other people that might be Tibetan
bowls, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or throat chanting or, you know,
Vedic chanting or devotional chanting or
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if we start to turn down
the ordinary and the mundane and we start
[SPEAKER_03]: to turn up the vibrations that we want to
resonate with, you know, higher vibration
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are in alignment with our
intentions, that usually goes pretty well
[SPEAKER_03]: for people, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this brings us to intention perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can still table it if you have more
questions about set and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just one thing I want to add too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of, you know, creating a
mental environment that you think is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work for the kind of work you want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also generally like to point out to
people to be doing the psychedelic because
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of my life, I have
certainly seen people be peer pressured
[SPEAKER_00]: into doing psychedelics because the rest
of the group was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make sure that you're doing it for
the right reasons that are your own in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to, you know, removing the
immediate stressors that we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, turn your phone off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give yourself a dopamine break from your
phone for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we talk about mindset,
one of the key tools for mindset is having
[SPEAKER_03]: a personal intention, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you were saying, man, know why
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do it because you want to and know
why you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm doing this to heal this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this to look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this to become more in
alignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: With my romantic partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this to become more in alignment
with the divine, you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what I usually recommend to
people is whatever that intention is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is try to write it out sort of in like
mantra form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by that is like short and
sweet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't want something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I kind of want this and maybe I
want that and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want something like short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to kind of cut through the
noise, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you can focus your mind on it in a
psychedelic state, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of our most well-known mantras in the
West are psychedelically inspired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like Be Here Now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: By Ram Dass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows Be Here Now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a psychedelic intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let It Be by The Beatles, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a story that says that the Mother
Mary that is referenced in Let It Be was
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria Sabina, the curandera from Mexico,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let It Be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course we all know Dr.
Bronner's All One or None, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So these sorts of like short, sweet,
like poignant, like cut through the noise
[SPEAKER_03]: intentions that we can use as an anchor
that will root us in our minds when
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is swirling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if folks are hearing this and going,
ah, I'm not going to do this woo-woo
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take the drug and go for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to encourage you that these types
of intentional setups, they actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while to many people this kind of
internal awareness of intention might be
[SPEAKER_00]: dismissible, in this realm that you're
about to play in, it is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by creating this intention,
you truly give direction to your mind and
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit of the direction that you want to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having an intention and giving your
mind and spirit a direction to go in is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be far more effective in most
cases than just going into it without an
[SPEAKER_00]: intention and just kind of like riding the
Bronco whatever random direction it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about best practices today
and having intention is truly a
[SPEAKER_00]: cornerstone best practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people can do what they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if somebody thinks that what
we're saying is woo-woo, I'm surprised
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're still listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's known.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I would even suggest,
my friends, are try it both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Run an experiment and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Report back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it a couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got integration circles where people
can come and talk about this stuff every
[SPEAKER_03]: week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to touch on here in
mindset, well, good mindset anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I think it's pretty important to have
faith in your drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your psychedelic comes from a sketchy
source and you're not sure what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, that can come up at the worst
times right as the psychedelic is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: on and you suddenly feel like it's brewing
and it's about to come on and then
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly you get this hit of adrenaline
because now you're second guessing your
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, any kind of drug,
even if they're not psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should know your source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with psychedelics, since it's such a
momentous experience, be sure to have
[SPEAKER_00]: faith in the quality and cleanliness of
the psychedelic that you're using because
[SPEAKER_00]: not only are there, it's important for
your personal health, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: important for your mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just kind of check that box of
safety off that you don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about the veracity of the psychedelic that
you're taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so test your drugs, kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Dance Safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get drug tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get test kits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you go to my link tree on
Instagram, I think with Roll Kit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an affiliate for Roll Kit,
you can get test kits there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to get as much sketchiness out
of the situation as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of us who kind of grew up under
the shadow of the drug war, we knew that
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a lot of stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were worried about getting caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were worried about what would happen if
people knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was all of this anxiety around that
and also that ends up internalizing as
[SPEAKER_03]: self-judgment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, am I doing something wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe on some level, we get off on
doing something that's a little taboo,
[SPEAKER_03]: but on another level, it gets in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if any of you have had
the chance to take psychedelics in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado since it's been decriminalized,
but it's kind of a whole different thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because that kind of worry and those
belief systems that are kind of cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've been carrying them around in our
subculture for some time, that's starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to get cleaned up and people are starting
to be able to have freer experiences where
[SPEAKER_03]: they are not worried about being caught or
being judged or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of that means is that you
potentially have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivate relationships with people in a
new way, where it's not surreptitious and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not under a bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pals who were on Instagram saying,
hey, please come learn how to microdose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a month's supply,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's hopefully going to become
more and more of the norm where people can
[SPEAKER_03]: feel free and confident and peaceful
around the fact that they are exercising
[SPEAKER_03]: their cognitive liberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to touch on briefly some of the
factors that would constitute maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I already mentioned one earlier,
the feeling of being pressured,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're being peer pressured to do it
because your other people in your life are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it and they're kind of dragging you
into it when you're not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be another one or two mindsets
that are challenging that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: caution folks to take a psychedelics
during that period of their life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, are you fighting with your girl?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just lose your job?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you not have housing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you not have safe housing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did your electricity get turned off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you not been eating well?
[SPEAKER_03]: These kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a Maslow's hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely want your basic safety
needs taken care of, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would want your relationships
relatively speaking to be in a fairly good
[SPEAKER_03]: spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd want a certain amount of space in
your work life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't want to have to be on the
phone right up until you took the medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: and then be on the phone right as it wears
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be stressful, especially if
it's a stressful thing going on at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these kinds of pressure, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting because your podcast
is called Shaping Fire and I'm really
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in the idea of shape,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: From like a somatic perspective,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think your people are familiar
with the term somatic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, but not everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and fill it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somatic is a Greek term.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means the living body in its wholeness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it means that we're this holistic
organism, this mind, body, nervous system,
[SPEAKER_03]: entity, personality, this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this whole thing is a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is expressed through the body,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the ideas of somatic theory
philosophy is that your body is a
[SPEAKER_03]: representation of your entire history,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that has happened to you,
it's smudged on your body like clay in
[SPEAKER_03]: some ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way that you walk, the way that you
hold yourself, the way that you react
[SPEAKER_03]: under stress and pressure, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been developed over years,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Through your experience, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way people work in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what's interesting is that once
you're shaped, you then shape the world
[SPEAKER_03]: that way and then you shape your own
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because let's say somebody feels like
they're not worthy of love, like they have
[SPEAKER_03]: that deep belief, I'm not worthy of love,
I don't deserve it, there isn't enough
[SPEAKER_03]: love out there for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can imagine how somebody who
believes that deep in their soul since
[SPEAKER_03]: they were like five years old might walk
through the world and hold themselves in
[SPEAKER_03]: their body.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could put two people and somebody
who's like, I'm definitely worthy of love,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I'm full of love, I've loved to give,
I'm open to receive love, I know it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: best stuff in the world, I love my
friends, I love my family, they love me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you put those two people next to each
other and you tell them, just stand
[SPEAKER_03]: neutral.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell who's who.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be obvious, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then the way those people move
through the world is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: different, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the person who doesn't believe
they're worthy of love is going to act in
[SPEAKER_03]: ways that reinforce that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person who believes that they are
worthy of love is going to act in ways
[SPEAKER_03]: that reinforces that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're going to get more of what
they've been getting because they keep
[SPEAKER_03]: doing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we are trying to do is,
what was the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I get to this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love talking about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaping fire, we're shaping ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had started on the factors that
constitute a challenging mindset,
[SPEAKER_00]: a time that you maybe wouldn't want to do
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So relatively speaking, like hopefully
we're in decent relationships relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're able to kind of show up in a way
that is present and available to receive
[SPEAKER_03]: the medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm still trying to figure out what
that has to do with shape, but we are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to start to be able to see our shape
in a new way, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we are constantly tense and
stressed, right, we're going to wear that
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're going to have to spend time kind
of like, unwinding that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like maybe if you've been doing
some yoga, you've been opening up your
[SPEAKER_03]: body, you've been taking care of it,
like the body set is as important as the
[SPEAKER_03]: mindset, I guess is what I'm trying to get
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're looking at challenging
experiences, sometimes we do need a reset,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess is what I'm getting at,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes people like, I've tried
everything, I'm in a bad place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something's got to change and
something's got to change now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sometimes people have to come to
psychedelics like that, but hopefully you
[SPEAKER_03]: can still carve out enough space,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another somatic word, space,
so that you can embody the space in its
[SPEAKER_03]: fullness and be present for it and be open
and not have to worry about the pressures
[SPEAKER_03]: of the world shaping you in such a way
that you can't stand up straight and be
[SPEAKER_03]: open.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been talking about the
cornerstone of psychedelic usage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is mindset and setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk a little bit about
setting, which is often a little easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: make good than the mindset part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you are the educator in this
area, why don't we, I'll start by giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you a general question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the factors in
establishing a good setting for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_03]: It should probably be sweet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just, let's start, let's radiate out
from the word sweet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be sweet and nice and
comfortable and safe, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And not too overwrought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although sometimes people, depending on
the molecules, sometimes people like
[SPEAKER_03]: overwrought.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, we know what,
like the LSD hippies of the sixties,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they decorated their spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They liked a lot of stuff that was very
vibrant and alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's a little bubblegummy for
some people, but sometimes it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, sometimes for,
depending on the molecules, sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: psilocybin, people spend most of their
time just inside, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with their eyes closed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're journeying inward, it makes,
it's less of an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing we do know for sure,
it should be neat and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want something that's neat and clean
and, you know, has a ceremonial energy to
[SPEAKER_03]: it in some ways, depending on whatever
that means for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a sense of perhaps sacredness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might want to think about,
again, like, where is your head at and
[SPEAKER_03]: what are you trying to create?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you create more of a temple
atmosphere, you might have more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: temple experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have just sort of a, very clean,
minimal kind of experience, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's maybe not a lot for the mind to
project onto.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it encourages the mind to go inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the things that I might say is
you decorate it however you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you talk to, you know, you talk to
your friends about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe you want a picture of
your kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want a picture of your parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want a picture of yourself as a
kid, depending on what you want to work
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you want people who are inspiring to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, what is kind of important
is that it's a container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of don't really want strangers
wandering in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to be neat and clean and,
in many cases, simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: In many cases, ceremonial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to kind of be sure that
you're not going to be bothered because
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: An intrusive, unexpected person suddenly
can really change the direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only because we might have to,
for a moment, try to present ourselves as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sober and regular when we're
actually having, you know, a pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: duty breakthrough moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly we have to fake it for
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can get messy, especially if that
person will be bothered if they figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, being in a good location,
a safe location that feels safe is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also include some of the
biological needs, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a source of water, a bathroom,
somewhere where there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: any threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other things that I've
recommended to people included a notepad
[SPEAKER_00]: and a pen, art supplies, you know,
soft blankets to soothe your nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system, trippy items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes movies, that are your
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I have always been very focused on
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really an indoor psychedelics
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a get outside where I know that
there's not going to be anybody around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, start looking at bugs
and mycelium and the weird, the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: glistening off the waves and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody has their own style of what,
you know, creates that vessel or that safe
[SPEAKER_00]: space for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really worth thinking about it
in advance and writing yourself some
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of like you're planning a
vacation for yourself so that when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: take the psychedelic, it's like,
oh, somebody who really cares about me
[SPEAKER_00]: planned this experience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person who cares about you is
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to just note that it might
be different depending on your dosage,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, people might microdose and then just
go about their daily life, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's sub-perceptual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is things that slightly up
from there, you know, is maybe sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: called the hycrodose, where people are
taking maybe, you know, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: than a microdose to kind of make the,
you know, the leaves shimmer a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not, their cognition isn't
impaired.
[SPEAKER_03]: That much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or sometimes called a museum dose,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of dose where you would feel
comfortable going to a museum,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit, maybe you take a
little bit more to go to a concert,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe depending on how you roll,
maybe you're taking quite a bit more to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to a concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe we're going towards
something approaching heroic, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where being out in public wouldn't do it
all, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you could be in a campground in
nature or things like that, but you would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably really want someone to look out
for you a bit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're, again, depending on
dosage, and this is why the general wisdom
[SPEAKER_03]: says start low and go slow, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's like, okay, I know that like if I
do, like I can pretty much manage,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can make a fire and not burn myself on
this amount of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if I'm really going to melt
down, you know, maybe somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: watch me if there's a river rushing by,
you know, because I might need them to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me that like I'm not a fish.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might not be the best time to go for
a swim, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we come on back over here for a
little bit and look at the water or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also, this brings us to,
you know, regardless of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to do this by yourself,
but if you're going to do this with other
[SPEAKER_03]: people, having some ground rules and
agreements, you know, that's also good.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking about containers,
right, is sort of like ethical and
[SPEAKER_03]: relational containers of, you know,
we're all going to, we're all agreeing
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're staying in this area,
whether we're staying in this house or
[SPEAKER_03]: we're staying in this backyard,
we're staying in this campsite,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're staying here for this time,
you know, we're going to agree that for
[SPEAKER_03]: this time, we're going to keep our clothes
on, you know, or not, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_03]: party, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we're not, nobody's going
to, you know, nobody's going to try and
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep with anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's going to cause any physical harm
to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the popular ones with my friends is
no one's going to turn on their phone or
[SPEAKER_00]: make a phone call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally we will need to use our
phones because you're trying to tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: story and you really need some data point
that might be on your phone, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, what was that place called or
whatever, or I want to show you this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture or whatever, which can all be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for goodness sakes, you know,
don't place calls or answer calls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we're going to talk
a little bit more about preparing yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: physically and mentally in advance of the
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire and
my guest today is psychedelic integration
[SPEAKER_00]: coach Daniel Schenken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients and
enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: which further enhance nutrient
availability for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_00]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend gnome automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 10 years, gnome automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he raises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the gnome automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages
[SPEAKER_00]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_00]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the gnome automatic shirts and other merch
[SPEAKER_00]: section too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want reliable seeds, hand-built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, choose gnome automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know though that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the shaping fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_00]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz
bang smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_00]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna make your own commercial spot
well, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: attended, but podcasts listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on shaping fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the shaping fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on shaping fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los and my guest
today is psychedelic integration coach,
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel Schenken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about the mindset and the setting,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you definitely want to
consider in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot during the first set about
how planning in advance is really a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the likelihood that you'll have a
good and valuable and meaningful healing
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be talking a lot about
that again here in second set,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a little different sort of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start, Daniel, I want to hit on
something that you touched on briefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to drive it home a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physicality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned that bringing a good,
calm body to the psychedelic experience
[SPEAKER_00]: can be really helpful, and I totally
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to illustrate that a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, depending on which molecule
that you take, most of them will encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: your body to void itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing that people that I've
worked with, including myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: have found value in over the years is to
take a little psyllium husk the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the day before in the morning,
so that whatever you may have eaten that
[SPEAKER_00]: is heavy, maybe you had some steak or a
burger or jalapeno poppers or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that that can sit in your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes during the digestion,
[SPEAKER_00]: your attention can come away from the work
that you're trying to do and start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the functioning of your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so make sure you're really hydrated as
well, because very often when we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: a psychedelic experience, we will actually
forget to drink water, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: good reasons to do psychedelics with
friends, because everybody can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: help babysit each other to make sure that
you are getting enough water and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the yoga and the two
things that I just mentioned, Daniel,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any other physical things to
kind of round out that group of ideas?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could also kind of just
refrain from eating jalapeno poppers for a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of days ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to... Oh, I was once
working with a guy who had his first
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic experience on a camping trip,
you know, and he had a friend with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had an RV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he came back, he said to me in
all seriousness, good set and setting
[SPEAKER_03]: starts with clean socks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he had been out in the woods and
the clothes he was wearing were filthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he really felt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something that you might not
notice if you are just drinking a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of beers becomes very obvious on,
you know, three to five grams of
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting how messiness and filth
and anything that's gross is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: usually really gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly isn't, you know,
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly people who can get
really curious about messy, gross things
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for whatever reason, the people I've
interacted with and myself, we generally
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be comfortable and clean and
orderly and, you know, just generally
[SPEAKER_00]: happy of body and spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, being curious about gross stuff and
being covered in gross stuff are
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we could make all kinds of
kind of cosmic, hi-woo ideas about why
[SPEAKER_03]: that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's pretty much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the kind of
preparations to make additionally if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do this experience with
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm very grateful that when I
got turned on to psychedelics in college,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in a peer group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, most of my first
experiences were, you know, three to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a big forest next to my
university and off we would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would have these fantastic days and
come back exhausted and dirty and take
[SPEAKER_00]: showers and then, you know, kind of have
this afterglow period in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing with friends that I'll get
us started with is to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of work with everybody to compare
your plans and your locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you all get together on the day
of your experience and you have different
[SPEAKER_00]: intentions, either A, some people might
have some hard feelings about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't a great way to go into an
experience, or which can sometimes be
[SPEAKER_00]: equally as detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your original fellowship, if you will,
of people who are going to be together,
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to do different things and so
they split off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your group of six comes off into a
three, a two, and a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be a very different
experience than if everybody has a shared
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is, and I'm hoping maybe you
speak to this a little bit, Daniel,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we always had like an emergency signal
or word and not emergency, meaning like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was usually a signal or word that meant
there is a moment that I really could use
[SPEAKER_00]: you to pull your shit together for a
moment so we can talk about something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like somewhat relevant or serious
for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can I get your attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've never really found a
really good way to talk about that with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: To delineate between like a safe word for
an emergency and a signal that I need your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you go about that with folks?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before we get to that, because I'm
going to think about that in the
[SPEAKER_03]: background while I mention this,
there's been a phenomenon recently,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you grew up with your friends and they
were your friends and you did psychedelics
[SPEAKER_03]: with your friends and that works because
they're your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So recently more and more people are
coming into the psychedelic space and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not even kids, they're grownups,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're not teenagers or college
kids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're these adults and they're
interested and they're curious and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, then there was a pandemic,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means that people were kind of
isolated and it also meant that people
[SPEAKER_03]: were becoming friendly with people from
all over the place on Zoom that they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't actually know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they think, because they've had,
you know, a half a dozen Zoom whatevers
[SPEAKER_03]: with these people, that they're soul
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get together and they take
psychedelics together and they realize
[SPEAKER_03]: really quickly that they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, people kind of take for
granted real relationship and real
[SPEAKER_03]: connection, you know, the ability to kind
of like smell somebody, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to know what your friends smell like,
to kind of be there when you are weird
[SPEAKER_03]: together at a restaurant, you know,
like all of these kinds of things that are
[SPEAKER_03]: really intimate relationship things that
are missing because you just log in with
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody for an hour or something and
you're on like a group signal chat with
[SPEAKER_03]: them, group WhatsApp group, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's different than being in an
intimate psychedelic space with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you want to actually be careful,
perhaps, about like who you're doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are these really your friends?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is there a container?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there agreements?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can help create an intentionality
that can help build that bond,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But to do it kind of off the cuff and
loose and pretend do it like a pretend
[SPEAKER_03]: ceremony, because what I see sometimes is
people like, oh, I've been to ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how they work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we're just going to be
chill and we don't actually need to have
[SPEAKER_03]: the group agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't need to kind of ring the bell
and set the circle or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be like, I don't need to breathe
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I breathed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, keeping in mind,
you know, are your friends really your
[SPEAKER_03]: friends?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you setting the stage properly?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have the agreements?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as far as this thing where you're
having safe words and things like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this comes back to like,
do you know your people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I sort of feel like with my
friends who are really my friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends, I can communicate an awful lot
with a cough, a pause or a side eye,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I need something, like I can just,
you know, I can kind of look out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: corner of my eye at my buddy and go like,
you know, and he'll be like, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, you know, let me show you something
over here in the kitchen, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we can have a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I like the idea that like,
just introducing that is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the, really the theme here is
making things explicit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have a very transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clear, transparent, explicit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have a lot of assumptions about how
the thing is supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, are they the same
assumptions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as we have talked about
where, you know, your ceremony is your
[SPEAKER_00]: ceremony that you designed and your
environment is your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing would be the safe word or
the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I have some experience with
this, I will also take it a step further
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, in my experience, we have found
that safe words are easily forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes a safe hand signal is more
easily remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ones that I used to use
back when I was a young man was we decided
[SPEAKER_00]: that thumbs up was not a good one because
we did thumbs up often just to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thumbs down, well, that's not really
good because that kind of sets off your
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we would do is we would
actually do like horizontal thumbs pointed
[SPEAKER_00]: out and we just put like the sides of our
hands together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a fun hand motion to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody in the group who saw it knew
exactly what this hand motion meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good example of it where I was not
trying to, well, actually, it wasn't me
[SPEAKER_00]: who was giving the sign, but this is my
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get attention and we want
people to pay attention, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily want to give people the idea
that there's something dangerous and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: influence their trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good example was that one of our
friends stepped on was barefoot and she
[SPEAKER_00]: stepped on some glass and she needed just
some basic first aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was something that we could provide
within our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were all kind of outdoorsy
people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all had our 10 essentials with us
when we were out in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to come together to heal our
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want our other friends to drift
off in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of wanted to work together to
apply the first aid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're on psychedelics,
things are a little odd to think through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she gave us the hand signal and
we're all like came together and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she showed us and we're all kind
of like a moment like, oh, blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we all just kind of sat down
together and we went through the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cleaned the wound, we bandaged it,
we chatted with her so she understood that
[SPEAKER_00]: this was not the end of her good trip and
things were still fine and she was safe
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were going to slightly change our
plan about how far we were going to walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she didn't feel, but it was all,
as soon as we all saw the hand motion,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all understood that, oh, we all need to
come together for like a little meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend that people include that
when they're working with a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you're reminding me of actually
is Disney World.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a non sequitur that should be
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they have now, like I haven't been
to Disneyland in forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever since I was a little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they get to give you like these
wristbands with microchips in them,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to like get on the rides and to get in
everything, you just kind of swipe your
[SPEAKER_03]: wristband.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what they realize is like,
like if the wristband works, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it flashes green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, you paid for your meal,
green.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the wristband isn't working or like
you're trying to go somewhere you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to go, it flashes blue,
I believe, because red is too dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't want people, they feel
like they decided that red would harsh
[SPEAKER_03]: people's mellow too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just say, I think it's really funny
that, you know, you don't want the hand
[SPEAKER_03]: signal to be too alarming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alarming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a better word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want your attention.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how to like bandage a simple
wound.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most natural thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just friends taking care of friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's an attitude that, you know,
if there's any, you know, guides listening
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, that, you know, we want to take
an attitude of like, this is the most
[SPEAKER_03]: natural thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just folks hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it ended up being a very
beautiful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, there were five of us on this
day and it was the five of us working
[SPEAKER_00]: together to heal one of the five of us and
all kind of gentle speaking with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and, and doing the first aid and,
and, and giving her healing, like
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation at the same time,
it probably was healing things in us at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as we were giving her first
aid, like healing us in the sense of we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a psychedelic experience to heal
emotional wounds or whatever us coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we were all, you know,
getting, getting good stuff out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to the point that I remember it
now, like what 40 years later,
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just to know like, like the
experience of, of competence and care,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of like, I can, we can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are people who take care of each other
and love one another and we show up for
[SPEAKER_03]: each other and do what needs to be done,
you know, cause like, it's a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bandaid, but you know,
on the right molecule, like that's an epic
[SPEAKER_03]: quest, you know, even though we're saying,
oh yeah, it's chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, we make things big in our
minds and, you know, healing our friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's the most, it's the biggest
deal there can be really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's like at the core of being
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the other things that tends to
happen is, um, you know, very often people
[SPEAKER_00]: will get separated, um, one way or
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, it's, it's,
it's, it's kind of a toss up with who the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that you're doing it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all have cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we get separated, it is easy to
go grab your cell phone and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I lost you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, um, I've been with
people where everyone's decided we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off our cell phones so that people
who might harsh our vibe, don't call us
[SPEAKER_00]: and interrupt what we've got going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, uh, in, in the situations
where we don't have the phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I usually work with folks in the room
and say, Hey, if you get separated from
[SPEAKER_00]: the group, um, we will meet at this
whatever location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when we realize you're not there,
um, we will all head to that location and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we will continue our experience from
that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure this has come across your
plate many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a story as old as time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do history again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So should we do kind of modern psychedelic
history or archaic tribal history?
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaic sounds more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll, we'll start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, when you go through places like
the Altai mountains and Siberia and just
[SPEAKER_03]: places where there are vast fields and
steps and Hills and mountains,
[SPEAKER_03]: you often come across big stones that are
vertical, like just plopped in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: of a field, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are like obelisk Karen kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the, the scholars believe
like, this is how people oriented,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you needed to meet nomads,
like you're a nomad, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In, in the Siberian mountains,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to meet people where like,
okay, on the solstice, I'll meet you over
[SPEAKER_03]: three Hills at that stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the stone that looks like a horse or
whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people were have been orienting
themselves, um, forever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To try and find their place in space,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause again, you know, like so our minds,
we're, we're taking our minds out into
[SPEAKER_03]: space, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're intentionally disorienting
ourselves, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the reasons why having
a good intention is key, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about that mantra intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can think of that mantra intention,
kind of like a stone in a field,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I'm lost in the, in, in Siberia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my stone, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to have something like that for
the group is it only stands to reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know if you've ever,
have you ever seen a dead show at the
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so back in the day, um, there was a
Rocky statue at the spectrum in Philly,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the movie Rocky, the boxer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, you know, they made a statue for
him in the movie, but then the statue also
[SPEAKER_03]: existed in real life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they put it at the spectrum for a
while, which is, you know, a Philly place
[SPEAKER_03]: where the dead would play.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where we'd meet our friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get lost, we'll meet you at the
Rocky statue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would not, you know, it's natural in
our bodies, you know, it's natural in our
[SPEAKER_03]: community spirit to say, you know,
we say it to kids, you know, if you get
[SPEAKER_03]: lost, this is, you know, meet me here by
this thing, you know, find an adult,
[SPEAKER_03]: find another mom to take you to this
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, that, that's as,
the most natural thing in the world that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have been doing for thousands of years
is picking meeting places.
[SPEAKER_00]: A corollary to that, that, um,
you know, really applies differently in
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations is, um, letting
somebody know what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: who isn't going to be with y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if, if you're, if you're
going to do a psychedelic and stay around
[SPEAKER_00]: the house, well, you know, that may not be
as important, but if you're going out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest, right, or I live on an island,
so, you know, it is not uncommon for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to decide that, that we're going to
get in a boat and go to one of the lesser
[SPEAKER_00]: populated islands near me in the Puget
Sound or, which is, you know, much more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a trip, um, pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, if you are doing anything where
you're going to be leaving home and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and it is a good thing to let
somebody know who's not going with you
[SPEAKER_00]: that y'all are doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and even if you're sure
nothing's really going to go wrong where,
[SPEAKER_00]: where that person would need to know,
there's almost always somebody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: group who is a little uncomfortable with
some aspect and they're, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to know that there is somebody who's
not with the, you know, four or six or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever of you, um, on the outside who
isn't, um, you know, tripping or isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing the psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people need to have a sober
person on the outside that they can call
[SPEAKER_00]: if they, if they start to kind of slide
off and, and start to potentially have a
[SPEAKER_00]: troubling experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they can be, they can be
used in lots of different ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm a strong proponent of,
of having there be a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a phone, a friend out there, just so
there's somebody who isn't on a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic in case they are needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you know, back to the idea of
sitters, that person might even be with
[SPEAKER_03]: you in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they might be they might be traveling
with you at the concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there, there is, you know,
the idea of, of sort of like the mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, the, the, the,
the den mother of sorts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it could be not to gender
anybody, but, you know, it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, but, you know, somebody who is
there and they are, you know, making tea
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're sort of there if you need
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is everybody have a blanket and okay,
it's hard for you guys to pick the music
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you just described it sounded
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I might actually be like that in
my regular life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it doesn't mean that the,
that the person needs to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: be right there because very often when
people are having a psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, it becomes very intimate and
they really only want the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: high there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, you know, if you're going to
have somebody, it's, it's perfectly fine
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're in another room reading or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, and if you need them, they they're
there and if not, maybe they just like go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the room, you know, every half
hour and just like make sure everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really just depends on,
on everybody's comfort level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really design this however you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is your adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and all Daniel and I are doing are
pointing out a whole bunch of best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that work for lots of different
kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I like to think of a sitter as
kind of like, um, Alfred from Batman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're in the dark, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, you imagine you're laying
there with your eyes closed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the dark, um, saving the
universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you come out of the dark and you
open your eyes and he's there and he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: would you like some tea, sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is he's been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you follow the history of Alfred,
like Alfred used to go on missions with
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman, he would like, he was the driver
for a while, you know, he knows how it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, he can, he can,
um, stitch up, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Alfred, one of the things Alfred does
is he stitches up Batman, fixes his wounds
[SPEAKER_03]: and offers him counsel, you know,
if he needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two more topics before we go
to commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and one is, um, there are some
classic foods and beverages that just seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to work well with psychedelic experience
for, so, you know, water, coconut water,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit is almost always fun, especially
like bright citrus fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are, what are some in your experience
that are, are, you know, low hanging fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: for being a good, a good thing to have
along?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like a nice fruit plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I generally like, yeah, I like a nice
fruit plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so often berries and citrus,
and I like berries a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're, they're bite sized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you have to check cause not everybody
likes every berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like dark chocolate a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think dark chocolate is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like cashews personally quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I really like, um,
the presentation as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's, there's a
difference between having just a plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: bin of berries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like over by the sink versus like taking a
really nice plate and a rate, making a
[SPEAKER_03]: mandala of treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if you could spend your entire
trip making that mandala of snacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually we were talking about
preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really nice preparation activity
because it's creative and it's nurturing
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's focused, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's intentional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're starting off your journey by
like, okay, like I'm here to, I'm taking
[SPEAKER_03]: care of my future self.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm just kind of bringing
my attention, you know, whatever I was
[SPEAKER_03]: doing in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm creating this kind of little work
of art, this little edible work of art.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, okay, there's the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, maybe there's olives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes it's, it's nice to
have something that's like a little
[SPEAKER_03]: incongruous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cause then you can hit all the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my salty olives.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, mushrooms seem to like,
well, you know, you might have like a
[SPEAKER_03]: drinking chocolate as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cacao could be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you'd want to know if that would
disturb somebody's stomach, but cacao is
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ginger tea is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystalized ginger is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you certainly don't want to have
to do much prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the moment.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do, you want to do it well in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, with most
psychedelics, most psychedelics in the
[SPEAKER_00]: short term are appetite suppressants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, when, when you're,
you know, going up and up, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: usually when you're going to get hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you have, you know, some time,
you, you might get a little snacky,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we're kind of talking about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, it, while it's not never,
it is a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical in my experience that when you're
in the, in the throes of a psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, that you'll be very hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you come down, you will often be
hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a good idea to plan in
advance what your, you know, end of trip
[SPEAKER_00]: meal is going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so at least, you know, where the
food's going to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because when you're, when you're
coming down, you might be tired and you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be feeling glowy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you might not want to be making,
you know, like serious food decisions that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, maybe you already have it or,
or maybe you have a plan that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, at the end, we're going to order
delivered food from our favorite place or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like most everything we've been
talking about, you can do it however you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's good to plan this out ahead
of time, especially if it's one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: first times so that the whole thing just
goes well for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and people do, you want to be mindful
that, and this goes with setting,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go back to setting as well,
that what is appetizing to you in your
[SPEAKER_03]: regular life might not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, whereas, you know, you might be a
person, like, uh, psychedelics have,
[SPEAKER_03]: have minted many vegetarians, you know,
who were very comfortable just eating
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they tried to eat whatever and it
wasn't working for them anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's like, oh, that's, that's,
that's not, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, in general, one of the
really cool things about psychedelics that
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people don't recognize,
you know, with all the stigma and stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: that in many cases they make people kind
of more wholesome in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They make people kinder and more gentle
and more attentive, um, and perhaps
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to, um, have fun in simpler ways,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat simpler foods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always, of course, but you know,
that, that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, on that note, we're going
back to setting is sometimes the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people think are trippy when they're
sober are not trippy when they're trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also true.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like, like sometimes
there'll be like, you know, cheap plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: crap with flashing lights in it is not as
interesting as like a smooth gray rock.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's odd too, because very often you
see the plastic and you're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an unreal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's, you just don't
really know how you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, interpret things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there are reasons why people
tend towards, um, natural things when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a really, there's a cool
book called psychedelic prayers by Timothy
[SPEAKER_03]: Leary.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, um, had, I think like seven copies of
the Tao Te Ching and a vial of acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he was in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: He fled the country and he read the Tao Te
Ching and he took the acid and he wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic prayers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that it talks about
in there are the things that are nice to
[SPEAKER_03]: have around, you know, and he,
um, seeing if I have it nearby,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, we can put it in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I don't have it nearby.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, something like hand woven
cloth, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncarved wood, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Raw rocks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said in his poem, he says bread,
bread, cheese, and wine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anything that is over 500 years old,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have like, like an ancient
artifact, that could be really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then of course he ends by saying,
of course it's best to be secluded in
[SPEAKER_03]: nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but just simple natural things,
you know, can go a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that have care in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of those superpowers,
you know, in the shows that sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a superhero and they can touch a
thing and they know it's history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a tripper knows if there's care in a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I want to touch on here
is is just the preparation of the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's always good, um,
whether you're on your own or with a group
[SPEAKER_00]: to be really clear, well in advance on
what your dosage is and to pre-make it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not debating on your dosage or
preparing it right there at the last
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, some of these
molecules, they, you know, you really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it with care and slowly if you're
going to be making a capsule or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you want to be clear if you're
going to do it with friends, are we going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a tea or are we going to,
you know, eat the mushroom fruit itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, I discourage people from leaving
that to the last minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I am cautious about answering this
too much because I don't want it to seem
[SPEAKER_03]: like too much advice about like that kind
of stuff, but you know, test kits are
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scales are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, guy, Aeroid is available,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are many reference
materials so that you can know what a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is supposed to do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can decide based on the effects that
you want that some things lean more
[SPEAKER_03]: towards one thing or lead towards another,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Guideline dosage guidelines are online,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends, you are listening to shaping
fire and my guest today is psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: integration coach, Daniel Schenken.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb inspected and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of me at cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up to date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.

profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has followup
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is psychedelic
integration coach, Daniel Schenken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friends, here we are at the final
set, and we are going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integration is actually the first reason
why I became interested in your teaching,
[SPEAKER_00]: because integration is a part of the
process that I am least familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by watching your TikTok and Instagram
accounts, I started really getting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of the integration I was doing right
and the integration I could be improving
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality of the advice that I was
offering to others has absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: increased since I started listening to
your insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with just asking you to
kind of give us an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integration is probably a pretty vague
term for most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't we start with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is integration and what are we
looking to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so and we can look at this from a lot
of different levels, like depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: we view who and what we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on a most basic level, you might say,
hey, you learn some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learn some stuff about yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to call them downloads these days
sometimes and maybe marching orders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was like, OK, maybe you should
start doing this, be nicer to people,
[SPEAKER_03]: say you're sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean your room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you should stop doing this,
smoking, drinking too much, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe on the long term, you want to
kind of move towards this in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to become a chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go to culinary school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so figuring out how to get those done,
like what is it like to genuinely be
[SPEAKER_03]: kinder to people?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it like to be more humble and say
you're sorry when you mess up,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though sometimes it feels like you
might die if you have to say you're sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's the most vulnerable thing in the
world?
[SPEAKER_03]: What might it be like to quit drinking
when that's what you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how you interact with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what does it take to actually get
yourself to and through culinary school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these kinds of dreams and upgrades
that are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is it going to take to kind of
make this happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's part of integration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what often happens is people start off
with good intentions and then it drops
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life gets in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have any accountability.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have anybody to support them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kind of forget our lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can forget our lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, what happens when we
forget our lessons is our vibe drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also, this is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like integration of transcendence
and mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what keeps me coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is I have these experiences of bliss,
oneness, connection, God, love,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking about shapes, like being in that
kind of ecstatic, connected state shapes
[SPEAKER_03]: us in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get shaped by bliss and joy and the
spiritual experience, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then perhaps we vibrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A certain way or we show up for the world
in a certain way, depending on whether or
[SPEAKER_03]: not, you know, whatever you think of
vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we show up different and we feel
amazing and we want to hold on to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the thing is, is that that starts
to downgrade to and it starts to downgrade
[SPEAKER_03]: because we stop practicing humility.
[SPEAKER_03]: We stop practicing kindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: We stop practicing truth and we drink too
much and we eat the wrong stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the lessons kind of correlate
the doing and the being.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start to see a connection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to be the person that I want to
be, it means I have to do the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that the rub?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you want to stay
connected to, one of the things I say to
[SPEAKER_03]: people, like if you want to stay connected
to source, you have to serve the source.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Integration might also mean that there are
kind of parts of you that you haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: embodying or living, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe kind humility parts, but it's like
sometimes we discover that there are,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we maybe are a more creative person
that we gave ourselves credit for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's like, again, this kind of
integration of being our, our full
[SPEAKER_03]: potential, like letting our full potential
really have a chance instead of just
[SPEAKER_03]: squashing it down and saying it doesn't
matter and putting it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might also be like integrate,
like healing might have to happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We might need to heal from like some
really difficult stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have repressed memories come up
of abuse or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to kind of integrate our own
personal history in a new way so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can be a whole healed, healthy person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can look at it from like a lot of
different angles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on who you are and what
you're going through at any particular
[SPEAKER_03]: time in your soul's journey, it might mean
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that somebody just had this
psychedelic experience and they want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: integration because they want to really
embrace the lessons that they learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this person already has a
therapist, chances are very likely that
[SPEAKER_00]: they will do this integration with the
therapist they already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lots of people who are doing
psychedelics don't actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship preexisting with the
therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of advice do you have for those
people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, get one if you can afford one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's of course cool if you find,
you know, there's an increasing amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: therapists who are willing to talk about
psychedelics with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find an integration circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find an integration coach or an
integration circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: An integration circle is kind of halfway
between like a meditation group and a
[SPEAKER_03]: support group, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it kind of might look like a
support group on the outside, but it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't necessarily mean anybody's broken
or wounded or anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we all are, but it's not like a
survivor type support group necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a slightly different vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are just kind of like
really growing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's got that kind of thing to it as
well as healing in some cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a place where you can talk
about, you know, what's important to you
[SPEAKER_03]: and what you got out of your experience
and how you want to keep it going with a
[SPEAKER_03]: group of people who are, you know,
semi-regular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you kind of form a relationship with
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes, you know, we have three a
week, you know, on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then depending where you live in the
world, there might be one in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just so happens that I have a
little online course on how to make your
[SPEAKER_03]: own.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can start your own integration circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, some community support is a
big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it, you have to do on your own,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody can not drink for you,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can journal and meditate for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do that on your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I don't know if that answers your
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next question would be,
I know that there are some independently
[SPEAKER_00]: minded people who are listening and,
you know, people who have got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, always seeking autonomy like I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're thinking, oh, well, I can just
do that on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just, I have this belief
without any real evidence that doing
[SPEAKER_00]: integration with others who are not,
who have got a different perspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little more objective, and
especially if they've got therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: training, that it just seems to be more
effective to do integration along with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else, if only to have someone to
bounce stuff off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't, we can't see ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can't see your own eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just, we just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm in the Skinner box,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So me looking, me observing myself is
incredibly subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need, it's helpful for us to have
somebody who's looking at us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your strategies of evasion are highly
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that for those of you in the
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your strategies of evasion are highly
sophisticated, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're, you know, one would,
I don't want to say need, but I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we need to have a little bit of
willingness and a little bit of humility
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes, and to recognize that we are
relational beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've just been talking this whole
time about, oh, I did the psychedelics
[SPEAKER_03]: with my friends and it's good to have a
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to have a group, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could meet, you know,
what would it be like if you and your
[SPEAKER_03]: party people said, okay, like we're going
to meet once a week at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, for an intentional meeting,
much like that intention that you all
[SPEAKER_03]: brought to fixing your friend's foot,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to meet for four weeks before
our journey for an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a conference call or
we're going to meet at the coffee shop or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get on Zoom and we're going
to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we want and we're going to talk
about, we're going to listen to the
[SPEAKER_03]: shaping fire podcast and we're going to
make our own checklist.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to set it up and we're going
to talk about our hopes and our dreams and
[SPEAKER_03]: our desires.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be vulnerable with each
other, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after the trip, we're going to
meet for four to six weeks for an hour and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to talk about how our
experience is unfolding and we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: hold each other accountable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to focus on what's
important and we're going to reflect back
[SPEAKER_03]: what we saw from each other in our
journeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to see what we learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: We learned about ourselves and each other
and we're going to be there if somebody is
[SPEAKER_03]: confused about something and offer them
support and good fellowship without,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, laying our trips on each other or
offering each other a lot of advice,
[SPEAKER_03]: but just kind of recognizing that we're
growing together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how would that change the journey?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would wildly improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing you describe it, I'm like,
man, I've never done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that level of integration would
really expand the healing that any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular psychedelic experience has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say it and it's almost like duh,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I don't know about how
psychedelics are done in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, but I've been involved with the
psychedelic world for 35 years and
[SPEAKER_00]: integration is not historically a part of
the you know, every person's psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my God, it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like keep in mind that,
you know, in Peru, like the Ayahuasca
[SPEAKER_03]: people of Peru, Chipebo tribes and such,
don't really do integration circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They live very different lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they live like a slower paced life,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's society in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was built off of people doing
Ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you and your friends had the
wherewithal to start a society based on
[SPEAKER_03]: your journeys together, like what would
that society look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's what you have,
right, in Peru in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's built into some cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not built into our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, vulnerability and community
is not necessarily built into our
[SPEAKER_03]: cultures, at least not like a vulnerable
kind of community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's more like, it's more external.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's exoteric and in a lot of
ways, you know, still built around like
[SPEAKER_03]: what the individual can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a real mechanical level, if somebody
wants to do integration with a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional, what would you recommend
they look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the attributes and what are
the things that they should think of when
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing who to work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've taught so many facilitators
and integration specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have got, you know,
a good list of best practices for choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you should start with me,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you would probably want somebody
who was very familiar with the territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't have an advanced
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't like traditional
schooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've taught and trained many
people with advanced degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I, as soon as I got out of
college, I just, I found a yoga mat and I
[SPEAKER_03]: hung out in yoga studios and meditation
halls and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where I did a lot of my
training.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to decide like, is the degree
important?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to what extent is the degree
important?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to what extent is the experience
important?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can get both, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially if there's rightness
of fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be working with somebody
who you feel seen and not judged and held
[SPEAKER_03]: by, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're clever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be, that's what you're kind
of looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if somebody is kind of just out
of school and they've, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've done a little bit of a ketamine
training, maybe, maybe not, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you can vet people,
you can ask people stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in the realm of social
media, you know, there's people out there
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of like, you know, blabbing about how
smart they are all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you find one that resonates with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the very important part is
to find somebody who's got a communication
[SPEAKER_00]: style that I feel blends with my own
because we're going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: intimate and subtle and, you know,
I think subtle is the right word,
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want somebody where we're already
kind of speaking the same language so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get to the core of the matters
swiftly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody is, one of the best
compliments I've gotten was disarming,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which almost sounds kind of, you know,
I always had to be like, wait,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, well, you just,
you make me want to like put down my
[SPEAKER_03]: weapons, my defense, my defensive
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can drop my defenses and be
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, okay, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you want to feel like you can
take your armor off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've been talking with
integration, about integration a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, because I've been learning as you've
been talking, I think that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably summarize it like if I were to be
talking with somebody else later on today
[SPEAKER_00]: about integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would describe it as,
so we learn lessons when we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic and those of us who have done
psychedelics, we've all had the experience
[SPEAKER_00]: of forgetting our lessons and leaving them
behind in the psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what an integration coach or
similar will do is help you bring those
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons from the psychedelic experience
and help to integrate them into your
[SPEAKER_00]: non-psychedelic everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the good things that you have
discovered during the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, you actually get to use those
to improve your life instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: having a psychedelic experience and having
these thoughts and then having them slip
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a fair assessment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great place to be with all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for explaining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap up there, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to put you on the spot a
little bit, but in a way that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably very used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting round?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting round.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be your last advice for
somebody who has never done psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: before?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have found a good source for the
psychedelic of choice that they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just trying to rev up the
moxie or the gumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like taking the step off of
a cliff or something to them, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what it's going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've got a little hesitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've even had the psychedelic in
their pocket for months, and they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: taken the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your advice for them to help
them in this next step?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't love this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you don't love the question,
maybe speak to that and we'll learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can lead a horse to water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for me to push somebody into the
pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would just be really curious if
I was coaching them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I was coaching them, it's not a
performance coaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, Glen Gary again,
Glen Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coffees for closers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we call development coaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just want to hear about your
anxiety, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know what's coming up for
you and what is holding you back,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's entirely possible,
it's highly probable that that trepidation
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're feeling has served you really
well throughout your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that trepidation, there may have been
times when that trepidation was the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference between life and death,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I want to honor, like I deeply
honor people's hesitancy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a display as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a display of wisdom and discernment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I bow to your trepidation and I
want you to know that it is safe and
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptable for you to be hesitant and
anxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, let's learn more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How has it served you in the past?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is its aim?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it held in the body?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it make possible for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it limit you from things sometimes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what can we learn about our
body?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is their shape, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming back to it, your person is showing
up and that's their shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bracing, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just picturing in my head,
you know, as I picture this person who's
[SPEAKER_03]: hesitant, I'm picturing like a
musculature, like a tension, almost as if
[SPEAKER_03]: they're bracing for impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picturing like, like, oh, like I'm
hand, like if somebody would be handing
[SPEAKER_03]: them the mushroom and they're like,
ah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their hands go out, like they're
pushing away, like, oh, like I,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's, I'm, I fear I'm not safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that tension there and
that's their shape and they can't do
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't not do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the thing that has been
keeping them in as good a shape as they
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so let's explore it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's learn about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if there are other ways to
practice being in a different shape that
[SPEAKER_03]: is more in line with your higher
intentions and value and purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I really like how you took the
question that you weren't a big fan of and
[SPEAKER_00]: turned it into a powerful and liberating
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that in you, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also appreciate, um, that a couple
of the different questions I've asked you
[SPEAKER_00]: today, um, you kind of, you kind of shook
off and as being not the right question,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, and, and kind of,
uh, working with me to mold it so the
[SPEAKER_00]: right things could be shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that level of
assertiveness in our conversation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, so thank you for your time
and thank you very much for sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: breadth of experience and, um,
your, your, your gentle self, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of people who are
approaching this, it can be a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: bombastic, um, topic area for a lot of
people, but your approach is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: so accepting and, uh, genuine and,
um, and soothing that, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you, you brought that to
us and shared that with us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.

share the message.

you're doing is really important work.

collaborate with you.

grateful that we, we got connected in such
