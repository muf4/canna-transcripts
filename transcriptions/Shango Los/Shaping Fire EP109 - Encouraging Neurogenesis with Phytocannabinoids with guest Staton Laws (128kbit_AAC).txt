[SPEAKER_01]: It has been debated since the beginning of
science whether who you are is seated in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mind or the soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the debate gets muddled really
quickly as philosophers discuss if perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: the mind is in the soul or the adverse
perhaps idea of the soul is part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without any doubt, whichever
interpretation you tend to lean towards,
[SPEAKER_01]: the physical squishy bioelectrical brain
is in a sense an essential part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and an essential part of however
it is that we function, make lunch,
[SPEAKER_01]: make inventions, and make love.

[SPEAKER_01]: His research interests center on the
nutraceutical properties of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and particularly he has been
published five times regarding the neutral
[SPEAKER_01]: protective bioactivity of cannabis
prevalent terpenes and its implication for
[SPEAKER_01]: the entourage effects of medical cannabis,
full spectrum formulations and potential
[SPEAKER_01]: use in dementia care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten is also the owner and founder of
the nutrition company Sprouting Soul,
[SPEAKER_01]: which advocates a holistic approach to
wellness predicated on ease and

foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dedicated to a lifestyle of wellness,
Staten has taught over 6,000 yoga classes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the USA and Australia and served as a
lead facilitator for numerous yoga teacher
[SPEAKER_01]: trainings and master classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set today, we will
understand what neurogenesis consists of
[SPEAKER_01]: and which cannabinoids encourage and
support the creation of new brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second set, we will learn about
neuroprotection and how cannabinoids help
[SPEAKER_01]: us keep the brain cells we already have
alive and functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the third set, we will focus
specifically on cannabis supplementation,
[SPEAKER_01]: including dosing protocols for folks
interested in health and longevity,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as cannabis patients experiencing
Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Staten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really glad to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we say that cannabidiol
causes neurogenesis, what exactly do we
[SPEAKER_01]: mean by neurogenesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That CBD promotes the creation of new
brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it all types of brain cells or is
it only particular varieties of brain
[SPEAKER_01]: cells that cannabidiol can cause to be
produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think we need to explain what
neurogenesis is and then break down how
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD plays a role in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to break neurogenesis
down into four different, I guess you
[SPEAKER_00]: could call them, stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're figuring this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until 1965 that we found in the
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus that
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis actually occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing a lot since then to
figure out how CBD can play a role and
[SPEAKER_00]: look, we're still figuring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to begin to address your
question, where these cells multiply or
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to split is in the proliferation
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might be a stretch, and I'm going
to try to make an analogy with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because this takes a similar amount of
time for a cell, a neural stem cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: to multiply and then become a neuronal
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the proliferation stage where these
newborn neurostem cells in the hippocampus
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to multiply, we could compare this
to the flowering tops of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these neural stem cells could be the
seeds inside this flowering top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they begin to multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about two weeks, then this integration
stage takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's after, say, the seeds
transverse to the ground and these
[SPEAKER_00]: neuronal stem cells migrate to certain
areas within the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start to spread out their axons and
dendrites, forming these neuronal-like
[SPEAKER_00]: projections and becoming more specialized
as a neuron, oligodendrocyte or
[SPEAKER_00]: astostrite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the phase where they
change their specific function in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very similar to, say,
like a cannabis seed sprouting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, forming its roots and also
beginning to project its fan-like leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: up towards the sunlight to receive
photosynthesis and also nutrition from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as these neural cells
differentiate, they actually start to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive communication from other neuronal
cells and stabilize and begin attempting
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish functional connections,
such as receiving neurotransmitter
[SPEAKER_00]: signals, as well as trophic support,
which is the feeding and nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also pro-survival factors,
which we'll talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout this conversation, such as
blood retribe, neuropic factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: neural growth factor, and a couple other
chemicals that float around and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: support this maturation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up, in the best case scenario,
about six to eight weeks, which you might
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to educate me a little bit more
on, which is, in my understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about the same amount of time it
takes a seed to turn into a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, six to eight weeks for flowering,
probably another four if you include veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we're with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're talking about time frame,
I'm really surprised that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: this neurogenesis timeline on a scale of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that this brain stem cell gets
created and then it takes time to split
[SPEAKER_01]: and mature and migrate and then become the
type of cell it's gonna be, in my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I see
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrations on TV or the internet,
all this stuff happens really fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing just moves and goes and it
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that anything in the brain might
take two to four weeks to develop and get
[SPEAKER_01]: to where it's going, that seems like a
glacier pace to me for the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a novice at understanding
neuroscience, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would make sense that I would have
some incorrect expectations I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the multiplication phase from my
research, I can say that it happens quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all see cells double or triple within
two to three days in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably the most tangible
thing that I can say as far as being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it happen in real time versus
reading about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think we're all learning about
the exact timeline of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine as a research scientist that
when you're in the lab and you're visibly
[SPEAKER_01]: watching these neuronal stem cells
splitting over these two or three days,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's A, kind of exciting and B,
maybe even makes you feel like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: having like kid like, oh, these are my
babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my, I'm growing these for
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta take care of them and make sure
they're fed correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that you would have a lot of
care emotions for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe I'm anthropomorphizing
too much, but I think I would care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of, my life is sort of dictated
by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: My schedule is based off of the cell
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also if I decide to differentiate
them, that's another 48 hours with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they run your life maze is
making them sound more like kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get you back into your timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we've under, we've understood what
happens, you know, regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, where you were going next was
what adding a cannabidiol CBD to this
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction does to encourage it probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk first about the indirect way
and then the direct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the indirect way that CBD can help in
the proliferation phase and the
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication phase is by increasing a
non-demide, which is the bliss molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: that is an endogenous cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this by sort of blocking pho or
fatty acid amide, hydrosylase,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an endime that breaks down the
monohyd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a non-demide has the ability to bind
to the CB1 and the CB2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been shown to promote cell
proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in the first phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that CBD, you know,
has its way to sort of tone up the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system to promote the
first stage of neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CBD can influence cell
proliferation directly by binding to the
[SPEAKER_00]: transient potential vanilla Lloyd type
one, or let's just call these things TRPV1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor and the 5-HT1A receptor,
which is the serotonin receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is demonstrated to help,
you know, the cell proliferation is also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also blood-derived nootropic factor,
which CBD can also promote, not only helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with cell proliferation, but also with the
activation of the differentiation and also
[SPEAKER_00]: helping the dendritic complexity,
which would form into the maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, as well as synaptic formation and
plasticity of these newborn neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through these TRPV1 receptors,
the 5-HT1A receptors, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood-derived nootropic sort of promotion,
it has different stages of helping the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy having hardcore research
scientists who are in the lab all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show, because you know the fine
mechanics and we're really interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, we all know that the
science is active, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot different than talking to a
lay person who will give you the story of
[SPEAKER_01]: how it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when patients talk to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I might be able to describe those
three things happening, but I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the mastery of the language like
you have that I think just makes us all
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like a bit more confident that we're
learning the good stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as thinking about those three
ways that cannabidiol supports
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, is it a fair model to think
that what happens when we take CBD is we
[SPEAKER_01]: are essentially like turning up the
governor on the engine a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: because your brain will naturally do these
three processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you add CBD, it makes the whole
process happen with more gusto and so like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe quicker and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to explain it if you play
guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like tuning your guitar while
the chords of each the guitar or while the
[SPEAKER_00]: strings of each guitar actually on a
different note, when you tune them
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly and you play that note,
that sound travels with more precision and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has a chord or a tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say that CBD helps with the
overall tone of neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by your description, what then one of
the things that CBD does is increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency of this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all these things are happening
regardless of with CBD in or out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: By putting it in, like you said,
to rev up the engine, it's actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: turning up the volume slightly through a
coordination of events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody is where they need to be when
the performance starts and everybody's got
[SPEAKER_01]: all the resources they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole manufacturing team is just
efficient and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about neurogenesis in the
cannabis world, we're usually exclusively
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about CBD because that's what most
people are familiar with as a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: that causes neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that we're continuing,
of course, to expand our research to other
[SPEAKER_01]: novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we familiar with any other
cannabinoids that cause neurogenesis in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to CBD yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would go with Delta 9 THC as the
other major phyto cannabinoid that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been recognized as a promoter of
neurogenesis in alignment with its
[SPEAKER_00]: function like anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its ability to have an affinity to
that CB1, CB2 receptor, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with that brain derived nootropic
factor, is what causes that first stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a rat model, I think it was around
1.5 milligrams a kilo, which they called
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat lower dose, acute and chronically
administered to a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did show that it enhanced neurogenesis
cognitive function and performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we looked at the sort of
function of Delta 9 THC, I'd maybe extend
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a bit of a stretch to Delta 8
because it does have some binding ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to CB1 and CB2 and maybe even CBN,
which even has a lesser degree of binding
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to those two receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at the other
significant neurogenesis agent in D9 THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it essentially helping neurogenesis in
the same three areas of process as the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it mostly just at the first step
since both CBD and D9 THC are acting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the anandamide, which helps that first
step?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is THC helping all the way down the line
in those three different time frames like
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD does?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it really mostly just there at the
beginning?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to look into how much Delta 9
plays a role in differentiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: integration, as well as the maturation of
the brain cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that could get into some of that
controversial application of THC in time
[SPEAKER_00]: frames in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my guess would be, yes, it does play a
role in the development of the brain cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's switch sides of the equation
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up to this point, we've been talking
about the CBD and THC helping and making
[SPEAKER_01]: this neurogenesis process more efficient
and more robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: These neuronal stem cells that split,
split, split, and then they mature and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they migrate to where they're going
to become the kind of cell they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to become.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can these neuronal stem cells turn into
any sort of cell in the brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are they only particular flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mean the particular cell of the
brain, they can become a neuronal cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: an oligodendrocyte, or an astrocyte,
from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to a certain degree, different areas
of the brain, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just recently saw how this kind of
occur in the hypothalamus, the striatum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the substantia nigra, and I think we're
finding maybe some more areas of the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: where this does occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also going to change my question a
little bit to get at something a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different, which is, what if I were to
change the question and say, are there any
[SPEAKER_01]: brain cells that cannot be replaced by
this neurogenesis that we described?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like areas of the brain that just cannot
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to get to is that
neurogenesis is great, and if it can
[SPEAKER_01]: replace all the parts of our brain,
that's even cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there are some parts of our brain
that just can never benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, I'd be curious to know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have hope that the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what happens when we do an
interview on the edge of the science we
[SPEAKER_01]: know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably going to run into some
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're clear now that CBD and THC can
help along the neurogenesis, and we know
[SPEAKER_01]: that neurogenesis can replace an entire
variety of different types of brain cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to look at a potential other
limiting factors that could slow down this
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, since kind of the point of
today is what is neurogenesis and how can
[SPEAKER_01]: we encourage it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there other inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be too many to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm open to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are there other inputs that need to be
present that, if not present, is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the ability of cannabidiol and THC
to do this increase of efficiency and
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in robustness of this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I imagine you might say is,
oh, it needs this particular brain
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical, 5-HTP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we encourage people to take
supplements to also encourage neurogenesis
[SPEAKER_01]: along with the CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the easiest way to answer that
would be health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right on whole food diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's break health down into three
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with oxygen, which we got to
have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold your breath and eventually no
brain cells will be doing much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing we need is hydration or H2O or
water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so more specifically, when we sort of
say, OK, well, we can get air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of take that a little bit for
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's both clean air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get into nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably the number one would
be long-chain fatty acids, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: omega-3s, play a pretty good role in some
of these processes that promote
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one would be polyphenols,
more specifically flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third would be a healthy
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get into those three if you'd
like and what supplements maybe would be
[SPEAKER_00]: best if that wasn't part of your whole
food diet approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hold on that next protocol question
and what and how much to take for the
[SPEAKER_01]: third set, because I've got that sitting
down there to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assuming all these components are in
place, do we know about a dosage threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: for CBD to cause neurogenesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, how much do we need to take
for this process to be improved at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I think most of our research
that could get around the dosage comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from either in vitro, which means
cellular, or in vivo, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: rap models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I were to condense everything I've
read up to this point, it would be around
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 to 10 milligrams per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes pretty hard to translate
in a human due to the bioavailability and
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as where we're at with
understanding how it even interacts
[SPEAKER_00]: different inside the human versus other
creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that you can make this guesstimate
based on the lab science, but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like a quick scale up based on your
experience, you're saying upfront that it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be hard to defend this number
because we don't really know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD is a relatively safe molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its therapeutic range is probably going
to be best to gauge that what condition
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be trying to use it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the idea of using it for
neurogenesis is really unexplored,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to traverse slowly with that
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one of the reasons why it
took so long for me to find you and hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: you down in Australia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not a lot of people who are
doing this particular work that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on around cannabinoids and
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask you a quick math question
just because you play with these numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the 3 to 10 milligrams per kilogram a
day, the very rough guesstimate that you
[SPEAKER_01]: gave, do you have an idea of how many
milligrams a day that is for say somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's 150 pounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do metric here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't gone back and forth
between... Yeah, I think that's around
[SPEAKER_00]: about 70 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say that upper threshold times 10,
700 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you weigh more and make the
numbers easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you weigh 100 kilos and three milligram
dosage would be on the lower end around
[SPEAKER_00]: 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a recent study just came out that
synthesized all the literature that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've done in human studies and said the
safe dose is around 60 to 100 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 to 100 milligrams per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were talking about 300 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's more of the therapeutic
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk a lot here on Shaping Fire
about the compare and contrast between
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates and whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody who listens to the show knows
that I'm no stranger to be pushing whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine versus isolates while
definitely also understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you need a novel
cannabinoid and it makes sense for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: spike your cannabis oil because you need a
cannabinoid that's very hard for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: get or to grow or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like many of us did in the early days
before we had access to CBD plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we could get CBD isolate from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also know that most of these studies
are using isolates because the studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking to set up future
pharmacology and they want the isolates so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can reproduce their results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's just a lot easier and less
sloppy to work with isolates than it is
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to deal with a direct whole plant
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that said, we also know that we're
big believers in the entourage effect and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that having groups of various
cannabinoids together, they act
[SPEAKER_01]: synergistically with each other so that
everybody can do their job better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all this just sets up this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that you would get a better
play from your CBD if you're taking it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole plant cannabis oil, commonly known
to us like an RSO or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you find there's, or from your
research, would you expect there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be any difference between the
isolate and the whole plant or perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: even it's favoring the isolate,
which will make me cry, but I'll believe
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go with, let's just look at CBD as a
molecule first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could call that an isolate or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've learned on a molecular
functional level has mostly to do with the
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to say that's the backbone
and we were to just go whole plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we didn't maybe have to look at
extraction methods and what is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say that whole plant extract
could be broken down into CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some small, small amounts of other
cannabinoids, terpenes, which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few, maybe 15 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your can of flavins on
top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those has a little bit of a
role in therapeutic targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a whole plant promoter as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think you would get some sort of
synergistic effect from a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could get into maybe the
bioavailability that it would enhance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because terpenes do play a role in
enhancing the bioavailability of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would think that the whole resin
preparation would just join with our body
[SPEAKER_01]: systems at an easier and less frictious
rate than a straight isolate would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our body would be able to handle
it more intelligently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we were to look at maybe the
potential of 10,000 years of coevolution
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant and the fact that we could
have been using this plant for that long,
[SPEAKER_00]: then our body would have more of an
intelligence with it as a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extract than an isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen an observationally in
patients with severe epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: there have been notable improvements with
far lower doses of CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a little bit of clinical
research around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not yet with neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question before we go to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is kind of a corollary
question, but doesn't really stem from the
[SPEAKER_01]: last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been talking about this
neurogenesis process that we like to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: up the volume on by taking CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything is happening more
robustly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to say aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not the right word,
but robustly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming that there are some either
resources the brain may need or damage
[SPEAKER_01]: that may have occurred to the brain that
is impeding neurogenesis that not even
[SPEAKER_01]: adding canabidiol can overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm specifically looking for
are any suggestions you might have of
[SPEAKER_01]: preexisting damage to the brain that might
block CBD from doing its job because that
[SPEAKER_01]: brain issue is actually shutting down the
neurogenesis in ways that the CBD cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's when we start getting
into where this leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads into Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get beyond that point of
dendritic and axonal breakage,
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't much of a chance that anything
is going to save that neuronal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at that as a collective
whole or a neuronal circuitry connection
[SPEAKER_00]: line, and a certain amount of it gets
broken down, then the chances of recovery
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be pretty minimal to that
circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting on board sooner rather than
later would make CBD more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know your specialty is more in
Alzheimer's, which we'll be talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: at more length later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other disease that I'm often
talking to patients about that involves
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis is Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been told by scientists just
standing at conferences and stuff that one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the reasons why CBD helps Parkinson's
patients is because it causes neurogenesis
[SPEAKER_01]: because a good deal of the impact from
Parkinson's is because they are losing
[SPEAKER_01]: their dopamine excreting neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a one-way trip if there's not
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so CBD is causing more of these brain
cells to come into existence, which kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like holds the line on the Parkinson's
to hold it from getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: A, do you have any point of reference on
this to speak to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And B, is that process potentially similar
to the one that we just described around
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were looking at a level of
dopamageric neurons and their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce dopamine, which I just kind of
recently learned about 80% of Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: is due to the lack of dopamine and due to
the lack of the dopamine-producing
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could create more of these
neurons, technically we could create more
[SPEAKER_00]: dopamine and effectively treat Parkinson's
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Parkinson's disease also has a protein
very similar to Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alzheimer's disease, the main
pathological hallmark is amyloid beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Parkinson's, it's alpha-synuclein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD has shown or demonstrated in
preclinical research that it stops the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregation, not completely, but it will
help argument some of the aggregation of
[SPEAKER_00]: these two proteins that create quite a
toxic environment extracellularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which affects their function and
eventually creates cell death or the no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer functioning neurons, which connect
to each other and create a communication
[SPEAKER_00]: line throughout the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for that, Staten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and take our first of two
short breaks and we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is phytocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Staten Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: which further enhance nutrient
availability for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky cards, and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_01]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_01]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential, and that is what
we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_01]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot well, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_01]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_01]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_01]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: and entrepreneurs who are always curious
to learn.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is phytocannabinoid researcher,
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we brought
ourselves to an understanding of what
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis is and how CBD and THC,
and to a lesser degree, some other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids we think, encourage and cause
neurogenesis to be more robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here in set two, we're gonna start
talking about not how to make these new
[SPEAKER_01]: brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk about how to protect the
ones we've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Staten, let's move on from
neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which components of cannabis resin can be
considered neuroprotectants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you give us a general definition
of what that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get back to that ability to
protect a neuronal cell, from cell death
[SPEAKER_00]: or from misfunctioning, there are many
different constituents or chemicals inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant that could be made into
a cannabis resin that will protect
[SPEAKER_00]: neuronal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: From things like the inflammatory response
and free radicals such as reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: species, so they can either act as an
anti-inflammatory compound or an
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant to protect neuronal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually, when put that way,
the fact that they are components of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis resin that decrease inflammation
and free radicals, that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the characterization of one
compound and its ability to do multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: things in different systems or places in
the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas when it comes to neurogenesis,
looking at the variety of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: components of the resin, it's primarily
CBD, certainly some amount THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a bit, a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we talk about neuroprotection,
cannabis resin is just essentially a soup
[SPEAKER_01]: of good things that actually protect our
brain in various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we start with the 545
identified compounds and we break that
[SPEAKER_00]: into 140 terpenes, 104 cannabinoids,
26 flavonoids, 20 steroids, and a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of lignin still being still benoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who the hell knows what else we're
finding inside this in the next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're mapping out their potential
to be neuroprotective through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really complex really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a blob, cannabis resin,
I think we've got a few things we can
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that this would be very,
since there are so many participants in
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroprotection, I would think that it
would be hard to research them because you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to tease them apart and they're all
working together in very high numbers and
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I asked you, you know,
what are they protecting us from
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first two you mentioned was
inflammation and free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just like a huge bucket that holds
just about everything or are there a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple others that you could check off for
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can maybe, if you want to talk a little
bit about the mechanisms, but if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: to look into diseases and what type of
proteins might be causing these
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory responses and free radicals,
we could look at for Alzheimer's disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: amyloid beta and tau, which are two
proteins that are forming to create
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation and free radicals on the
inside the cell and also inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the cell and how CBD can play a
role in reducing inflammation and also
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with the maybe even endogenous
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell's ability to deal with these
free radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like putting Alzheimer's and
dementia all in the same basket and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like to generalize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'll just stick with
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we understand the functioning at this
point of Alzheimer's in the brain where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are able to get down to the specific
mechanisms of cannabis neuro protection
[SPEAKER_01]: that's working?
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me a little bait there with the
mechanism and honestly, if you can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: understandable to some degree to a lay
person, I'd like you to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we looked at a protein in the brain
that forms naturally, amyloid beta is a
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally forming protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just part of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has got some of that floating
around in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is it begins to aggregate and
when it aggregates, it sort of clumps
[SPEAKER_00]: together and forms a plaque and when too
many of these plaques build up inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, they begin to form inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also begin to irritate the cells and
they form reactive oxygen species,
[SPEAKER_00]: lipid peroxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one mechanism that CBD and some of
the other terpenes can do is actually to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop the aggregation of this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it will reduce the cascade of
negative effects from this protein by just
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming an anti-aggritory agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, protecting the cells from cell
death either from an inflammatory cascade
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemicals or from an overproduction of
reactive oxygen species, it all leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: cell death.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two kind of corollary questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first corollary question is if
inflammation is trying to inhibit
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis and by using cannabis,
we're decreasing the inflammation and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping the neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with so many patients that have got
all these different inflammatory diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: from autoimmune and rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole list of these inflammatory
diseases that are so common in our modern
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will this body inflammation also be likely
presenting in the brain and the rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_01]: arthritis patients with all this body
inflammation and all their joints is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably also having a difficult time with
neurogenesis, but that's just not the part
[SPEAKER_01]: that's usually talked about in their
disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really complex one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that if there are
targets inside certain cell families or on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell inside cell families that are the
same similar targets in the brain cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we could say like one target that CBD
is pretty good at activating is the PPAR
[SPEAKER_00]: gamma receptor, which once it's hit,
it sort of blocks this cascade of
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-inflammatory molecules such as the
tumor necrosis factor alpha, the
[SPEAKER_00]: interleukin one, and all these other
cytokine released, which it is fueled by
[SPEAKER_00]: amyloid beta, but there are other factors
that go on in different sort of areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where this could be a target for CBD to
reduce this inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of lay folks, neuroprotection
and neuroplasticity for a lot of folks are
[SPEAKER_01]: like synonymous and they kind of use them
interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much truth is there to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not the same thing,
which I'm assuming they're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you explain what neuroplasticity is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give it my best attempt with saying
neuroplasticity neuroplasticity is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability for the brain to communicate in a
simple way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this communication that we're
using right now on the phone, if it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: real staticky, then it's not very plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not communicating, but if it's
clear, then we're having some good
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroplasticity, which would involve
function would involve communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would also involve being able to,
you know, cause even cells can sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: change their shape to allow them to
communicate better, which might even fall
[SPEAKER_00]: in the form of resilience or
neuroplasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say it's function, communication
and adaption to different things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: learn or, you know, I guess we're still
trying to map that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the cell is healthy, it's going to
function better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore it will be more plastic or
neuroplastic using layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how cannabidiol would add to
neuroplasticity since we often think of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD as a signaling molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if at the heart of neuroplasticity is
community communication and the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate, you know, throughout the
cells, it would seem that adding more CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: would be able to encourage more and more
rapid communication between the different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one molecule in particular that I find
interesting with CBD's abilities is to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance acetylcholine, which is sort of
like the master communicator between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a particular enzyme
acetylcholterase that breaks down
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can block acetylcholterase to a
certain extent, we can enhance the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: of acetylcholine in its communication
between cell and cell, which is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the AD therapeutics drugs that are
out there do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that functional standpoint,
CBD does enhance the communication or the
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroplasticity between the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're wanting to use cannabinoids to
increase our neuroplasticity, can you give
[SPEAKER_01]: me a couple of examples of things that
either, A, things that we might do that
[SPEAKER_01]: might decrease the neuroplasticity,
or if you want to keep it on the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: level, the kinds of things that can
inhibit our neuroplasticity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's lots of toxins that will get
in there and block the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you overdo THC, it can somewhat
crowd the communication line or just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stop it wanting to function
altogether, which has its benefit in some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we wanted to enhance the
communication, then we got to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells functional and as healthy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of factors that go into
how to enhance this communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like we're talking about
like, you know, everything, environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: toxins, you know, probably a lot of
different types of pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, you know, huffing acetone,
you know, there's probably lots,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these things probably would impact
neuroplasticity in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we're kind of, we're kind of back
to the place where we were when first set,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're talking about, you know,
good living helps all of this stuff we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's now focus on the impacts of a
brain without neurogenesis, which will
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of set us up for the third set
talking about, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that we can help patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always just assumed that
decreasing neurogenesis is generally a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on what we just said,
if we're doing more things that age us,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, smoking tobacco and
drinking and, and, you know, poor sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of these things that, that these
will all impede neurogenesis over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true or is there a particular
mechanism at the heart of it that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that in general, I'm going to agree
with you that just aging itself will
[SPEAKER_00]: promote the degeneration of neuronal
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inhibit the ability for neurogenesis
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we looked at, say, a toxin like
even alcohol, CVDs comes in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen that it can, one, reduce your
cravings to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, can also protect the liver from
inflammation and even brain cells from
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to some extent, there is
some things we can't avoid, but if CVDs
[SPEAKER_00]: coming around and, you know, showing us
that, hey, this can show some
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotection alongside of a neurotoxin,
then we've, we have at least some defense
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can use outside of just,
you know, lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think we need to,
to, to bang on the eat, hold foods,
[SPEAKER_01]: get exercise, live well, drum anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're pretty much set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so dear listener, stay with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take our second short
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we come back on for set three,
we're going to talk specifically about
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's and dementia and also
longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if you, you know, if you're
presently pretty healthy, but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to stay that way, stick around to
learn more about that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire and
my guest today is phytocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher, Staten Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend gas lamp seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably already know gas lamp seeds
as HEMBRA genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: HEMBRA recently changed their name to gas
lamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp is a female operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas lamp seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 regular varieties and over 200 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names you know you can trust like compound
genetics, Humboldt seed company,
[SPEAKER_01]: night owl, in-house, fast buds,
gnome automatics and ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_01]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited gas lamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_01]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will
give you some extra freebies that will get
[SPEAKER_01]: your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gas lamp seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the code shapingfire all one word at
checkout and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: additional set of gas lamp provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gas lamp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomycho endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomycho is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomycho is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomycho to both speed up
the growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomycho.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomycho.com
[SPEAKER_01]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's d-y-n-o-m-y-c-o.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomycho on Amazon or dynomycho
[SPEAKER_01]: .com by using the discount code
shapingfire, one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomycho to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomycho endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my own garden, insights and best
practices from personal grows everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: and always gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_01]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is phytocannabinoid researcher,
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are in the big third set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Staten, at the end of last set,
we were talking about how aging,
[SPEAKER_01]: and depending on how fast we're aging
because of how much we're riding our body
[SPEAKER_01]: hard and abusing it, all of those things
will decrease our neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD and THC and some other
cannabinoids can help support
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, but there's only so much can
be done if our body is aging, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Either on its own or because we've been
living hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you explain a bit about how this
lack of neurogenesis... Well, actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: before we go to that, I want to ask a
definitional question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often people, they'll say something and
then they'll just say Alzheimer's disease
[SPEAKER_01]: and dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group that them together, but they
won't put them in the same bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could, would you just give us a
brief understanding of what's different
[SPEAKER_01]: between Alzheimer's and dementia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as a lay person, they kind of
sound the same to me, but people always
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about them separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing there's a difference that
I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dementia can be categorized into
different forms, but Alzheimer's disease
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most common form of dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to say dementia is where
these protein aggregates start to form and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause memory loss or body dysfunction and
how it operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it progresses, then it might form into
a specific type of disease from dementia
[SPEAKER_00]: called Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease is kind of the end of
the road of a form of dementia and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the most common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked a little bit about the
mechanics last set about precursors to
[SPEAKER_01]: dementia and then Alzheimer's and how it
progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're talking about the different
symptoms of the ailments, forgetting
[SPEAKER_01]: things and the changing relationship with
one's body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just pick one?
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two of those and, um, and explain
to us the mechanics of what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: with Alzheimer's to cause the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so moving from what causes Alzheimer's
to what does Alzheimer's cause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll go with just the big definition
and filter it down to what, what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have these natural amyloid beta
proteins, in the brain and they form
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates, then at the same sort of time
inside the cell are these neurofibular
[SPEAKER_00]: tangles, which consists of the
hyperphospholated tau protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is partnered, uh, this
deleterious process is partnered with
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen
species, which is your oxidative stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria damage, uh, that's inside the
cell, outside the cell reduction of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine levels, which we're talking
about plays a role in the neuroplasticity
[SPEAKER_00]: or the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these networks begin to lose their
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So misplaced networks among neurons inside
the hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that it actually shrinks and we
get this chronic neuroinflammation causing
[SPEAKER_00]: memory loss and cognitive impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we can't even, you know,
take care of ourselves in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this idea of misplaced networks,
um, that's a really, um, it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient phrase because it really does
describe what I experienced when
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting with, um, Alzheimer's
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also there's something about that
phrase that captures some of the sadness
[SPEAKER_01]: of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, uh, it can, you know,
really take you down a road that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: you and your family members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this brings us to a place where we
know neurogenesis and neuroprotection are
[SPEAKER_01]: essential for our brain to function
properly over the longterm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it slows down with age,
it leaves us open to debilitating,
[SPEAKER_01]: debilitating brain issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also know from first set that the
cannabis comp that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: components, um, can support neurogenesis
and neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so obviously we've made the case like
take some cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, um, so I'm going to ask you about,
um, some cannabis protocols that you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that might make sense for someone who,
who still has brain health and wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then I'll kind of reapproach
the question again for somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: already experiencing, um, you know,
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I guess this first one,
let's, let's throw this kind of in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the longevity, uh, bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been doing a lot of thinking
about cannabinoids as a, as a longevity
[SPEAKER_01]: tool and, and it really seems to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so let's say that like,
you know, even though we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's got something wrong with them,
um, well, let's say that we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a person who's generally brain
healthy and they're not, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing dementia or Alzheimer's at
this point, but, but they don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, or, or maybe they're like me
and, and some of that stuff runs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to, I want to bioprotect against
it in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what would you see as, um,
a, a, a dosing protocol for somebody who
[SPEAKER_01]: is thinking more about, um, uh,
longevity and, um, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term health, um, before, uh,
something, a brain disease has,
[SPEAKER_01]: has shown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess we've got to always throw that
disclaimer alert out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not medical doctor or,
uh, and make sure you see your physician
[SPEAKER_00]: before taking a substance that is new to
your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You beat me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually my job, but you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and are we talking all cannabinoids or
just CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, um, I would like to hear what
your, your blend would be if you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, if you, you know, maybe you're going
to tell me that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 20 to one of a, of a certain potency
taken every day or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, at this point, um,
you have got all of this various
[SPEAKER_01]: information already preexisting in your
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if, if you were to put together a
best practice for a cannabinoid supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: to preserve, uh, brain health,
what would it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably start with just CBD
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you'd never used cannabis,
you're like, I've heard cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is going to help my brain as I age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mean, even we go back 20 years from
now, that was, uh, you know, talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the devil's tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, now we're looking at it as a way
to preserve our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with CBD, because it's
probably the safest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would almost have to say that if
we're going to even ask this question,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'd probably be concerned around the
age of 30 to 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're, if we're still healthy,
you know, this is around about 65 is when
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia like symptoms usually present
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're beyond that adolescent phase
where THC is going to be as harmful as
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're in that phase where each
either CBD or THC could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say starting with CBD,
cause it can start to maybe help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide do its, uh, do its thing with
the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there's some other benefits that come
along with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if CBD is not effective and you
slowly increment your dose and you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking a plus a hundred
milligrams a day and still not seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, then I would start adding THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you're saying, maybe starting at
that 20 milligrams of CBD to one milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we start, let me go 20 to five,
20 milligrams of CBD to five milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, or maybe even go 50 CBD to five THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would slowly increment, especially
THC and even more specifically if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: an underlying psychiatric condition with
THC because it is quite psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finding that, that right
milligram dosage and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, THC has its own unique benefits on its
own right, uh, with helping the brain in
[SPEAKER_00]: many different facets outside of what
we've mapped out pharmacologically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start slow, see which one works best
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally having a higher amount of
CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, if, if, if you're at
home listening to this and you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about putting together, you know,
a protocol of your own and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you are fortunate enough to be in a
location where you can grow your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, high CBD, very low THC,
um, you know, plant some kind of high CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp plant or something and make your own
RSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that that's very fortunate and,
and don't be shy about, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: spiking it with CBD isolate because,
you know, you can get really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to shop around,
you know, you know, find, find somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who, who stands by their cleanliness and
their tests, you know, like, like a future
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds or somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then, and then don't be shy
to spike with that to get up to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the CBD numbers that you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because for, for most folks growing
your own high CBD hemp plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: processing it all, um, is just not going
to provide you with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred milligrams of CBD a day plus
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, you know, if you've got a
big farm, like, you know, maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you're that much of a baller,
but for most people, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, you know, I used to talk
trash about this approach, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think that part of what's
important is that we all remain active
[SPEAKER_01]: learners, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and while I would love there to be,
um, so much, you know, CBD resin available
[SPEAKER_01]: to everyone at cheap prices that,
that we could only use that well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when it comes to our health,
um, you know, sometimes, sometimes we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, um, in the way that works,
um, not, not the way that we necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so anyway, um, I just share that
because I had to turn a corner about using
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate for some applications and,
and, um, it wouldn't surprise me if some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you were the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so, so now that we've got this,
so thank you for this protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, this was, this was exactly the
level of specificity that I was looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for stating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's talk about a, um,
a different protocol because now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and who knows, it might be that it might
end up being the same protocol for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but now we're talking about somebody
who is an Alzheimer's patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they've, they've already
been talking to their family that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to try this and their family is in
support of it, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, would you make any changes to this
protocol to somebody who's already
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing symptoms, who's already on
this path?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause we just don't know how they're
going to respond to either compound CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or THC or the plethora of other
phytochemicals in this extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if, if one's extremely
irritable, then, you know, a faster acting
[SPEAKER_00]: lower dosage and what you can get your
hands on, um, approach could be THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, cause it's, it's a tricky
question to address this with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries, laws, states,
and, uh, financial burdens that getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of these compounds will, will do for
that particular patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's easy to recommend if,
if you're in a state that it's highly
[SPEAKER_00]: available, but it's even more difficult to
recommend when one can't even afford the
[SPEAKER_00]: medication, especially when you're saying,
oh, you know, you might, you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking around a hundred milligrams of CBD
to get any sort of effect from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, you know, like here in Australia,
the average milligram is about 10 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at a hundred dollars a
day for a medication that might work
[SPEAKER_00]: versus if you can get your hands on,
you know, a hundred milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: divide that between 10 days, you might be
getting more, uh, therapeutic targets
[SPEAKER_00]: ticked by a less expensive protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, consult your medical doctor
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you live,
it could somewhat dictate this protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a little bit safer, but you might
work better with THC, especially in later
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what will our goal be,
um, when the patient or, uh, is taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the protocol, um, with, with
neurogenesis, are we, are we just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to like hold the line or is it possible
that we don't we can improve the patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because, uh, I believe that the,
the case is, is that when we, when we
[SPEAKER_01]: lose, um, neuron producing when our,
when our neurogenesis flags and slows,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it's, it's, it's harder to create new
cells that do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're just trying to do is,
is hold the line on our ability to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: to cause neurogenesis where it is and just
decrease the sliding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is that it, is that a correct
understanding where, where, when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting neurogenesis, we're just going
to be supporting where we're not where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not necessarily going to be
improving it in such a way where,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we could pull somebody back
from the grips of Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've always got hope that,
no matter who you are out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have the ability to create
more brain cells in the right environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say through your lifestyle and
through maybe some, uh, supplements that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes cannabinoids and the word
supplements to your protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've got enough, uh,
neurons that are functioning correctly in
[SPEAKER_00]: your goal here is to preserve these
neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, you know, there's some
potential for these cannabinoids to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: These neurons from being affected by,
whether it is reactive oxygen species,
[SPEAKER_00]: these cytokine storms from inflammation,
uh, and also from acetylcholterase from
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down acetylcholine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these exogenous cannabinoids,
they might help with our endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, such as CBD and anandamide,
or THC might go in there and help
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate some more, uh, proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of these brain cells and they might
protect the ones that we already have and
[SPEAKER_00]: the functioning or the neuroplasticity of
these brain cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there's a lot of potential here
for this to help on a cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also on a behavioral level of why
these, uh, symptoms of let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease could be modified by
these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, let's take a step back one more
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as we're wrapping up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so we've, we've talked about
neurogenesis and neuroprotections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we understand how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand how our ability to do that
ourselves worsens with age and how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: support that system by using, um,
by using cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we've, we've looked at the
applications for, you know, just regular
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who want to take it as, as a
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very similar protocol for folks
who are actually, um, showing the impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the lack of neurogenesis in things like
Alzheimer's and dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so with all of that, you know,
I, I've not really seen it called this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for me, that sounds like we're
describing CBD as a nootropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you consider CBD to be a nootropic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can improve cognitive function,
then it would be, uh, I guess fitting
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the umbrella of a nootropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's the way I see it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so far I haven't seen it marketed
that way, but, um, it's, it's interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: cause like nootropics are like super hip
for the, you know, the longevity folks
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and CBD is hip with a different group
of people, but I haven't seen anybody like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of cross market to both groups and
call it a nootropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what I'd like to, to end the
episode with, uh, Satan is that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, you are um, you know,
you are a research scientist and you are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the specifics of neurogenesis,
but I also know that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are a whole food advocate and you are
a healer and, and, you know, you teach a
[SPEAKER_01]: yoga and, and so you're kind of a,
you know, a holistically minded researcher
[SPEAKER_01]: who's, you know, doing this, this balance
between holistic mindset and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Western medicine, which is it got to be a
very interesting balancing act for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, because you think about this
all the time, um, I just like to like kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of hand you the mic and have you kind of
take us out of, um, you know, what advice
[SPEAKER_01]: would you give to a human who wants to
keep their brain, um, functioning as far
[SPEAKER_01]: into life as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the benefits of neurogenesis and
neuro protection, would you just describe
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the, you know, lifestyle
attributes that this person may want to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider beyond simply taking a CBD and
potentially THC protocol as we've
[SPEAKER_01]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we addressing just the general
person that's after mind longevity or are
[SPEAKER_00]: we addressing the Alzheimer's patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say just a regular person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, somebody, somebody who's not,
uh, uh, you know, not experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: Alzheimer's yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, just somebody who wants to,
you know, keep their brain healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a general brain health question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll break it down with,
uh, the necessities again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to have oxygen, water,
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxygen with, uh, breathing,
we all can learn to breathe better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get into the anatomy, but simply
if there was one word I would say to use
[SPEAKER_00]: and to learn would be ujjayi breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a yoga concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get into that if you'd like,
but basically it's, it's a way to take air
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out of the body with more
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just spell it because we won't go
into it today, but people might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's you, uh, sorry, I didn't mean
to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ujjayi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: U double J A Y I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what goes with yoga course is posture,
uh, learning how to lengthen the spine,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it straight, which supports the blood
flow or the nutrients into and out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, which the next one would be
understanding a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: lymphatic system and helping the clearance
of too much of these aggregate proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also making sure your body,
let's just call it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, uh, it's functioning to deliver
nutrients, but also to remove or detoxify,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, these potential proteins in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to mess you up, which is
what some of the, you know, AD drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: recently come out to do is actually to
remove the proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, uh, breath, good clean
water, um, and which considers some
[SPEAKER_00]: electrolytes that came from a really clean
natural source to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrated, have good posture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into, you know,
doing our best to not expose ourselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: too many toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to live in a natural place,
trying to get outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we looked at what can stimulate
neurogenesis, I think probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest ones is exercise and, uh,
you know, exercise produces more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: brain to drive nootropic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also creates more endogenous
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two combined together is what
helps the cells proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can kind of get into that
neuroprotection side with, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the protocols of our supplements
that will help protect us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get into nutrients,
I'd probably be looking at, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: your omega-3s like E3 live, which is a,
it's, um, an algae that's quite high in
[SPEAKER_00]: DHA and EPA, which is known to support
brain function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd look at making sure the diet is
actually extremely high in plant secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, which those include a big
pool of the polyphenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we looked at those specifically,
it would be the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even maybe look at getting the
microbiome up as far as the good bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure you take some form of a
probiotic on a regular basis, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: through sauerkraut in the diet or whether
it's through, you know, active yogurt or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maintaining that with lots of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your pre, which is your
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your pro, which is your
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you combine those two together and you
get these postbiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a healthy microbiome,
these molecule, or not molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: these bacteria in your gut will chew up
fiber and basically create these
[SPEAKER_00]: postbiotics, which are nutrients that they
create that are good for the brain as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, a lot of these
flavonoids or polyphenols that we consume
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually get into the body until
they hit the gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get turned into things that
are going to be good for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, and then, you know, being positive
about life, I think probably could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one thing to have a bit of a
passion for whatever you're doing in life,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's doing the laundry or the
dishes, just, you know, being positive
[SPEAKER_00]: through the whole process, having a will
to live will ultimately expand your
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping yourself healthy and feeling as
good as possible definitely helps with
[SPEAKER_00]: that will to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to admit, some of it isn't,
you know, like the exercise, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't too surprising, but to, um,
to see it put together in such a elegant
[SPEAKER_01]: package with explanations of about why,
um, I, I always, I always find it easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the healthy choice when I understand
why I'm doing it instead of just like
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling like I'm not allowed to have
something anymore, which, um, doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: usually work super great for me,
but, um, but, but, but getting inspiration
[SPEAKER_01]: to go towards something I do want like
long-term brain health, especially since
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already had a brain injury,
I don't really have anything to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't have much left to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I need to, I need to protect
what I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so anyway, um, Stacey, you've just
been like absolutely delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your ability to translate,
um, a lot of this, you know, hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: bench science that you do, um,
you know, at the university, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to translate it into lay language so that,
um, you know, you can bring some of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, some of our lay people along
with the citizen scientists, along with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the caregivers and the doctors
who listen to show you kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: provide information in a way that,
that we get to bring everybody along and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, that's not a skill that
everybody's got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I appreciate that skill in you
and, um, your good heart and your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your wanting to, um, you know,
uh, be here and, and help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also your willingness, like you're,
you're doing this interview in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, since you're in Australia,
you're actually doing this interview
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow while I'm, I'm having this
interview tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate a little bit of time
travel as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: On shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope all the listeners out there,
uh, benefit from everything that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed over the past 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we keep, uh, transversing into the
future to help each other understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how natural plants and behavior
and lifestyle modifications can all
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit no matter what stage of life that
we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dear listener, if you want to get in
contact with state and laws, there is one
[SPEAKER_01]: way to do it and you can reach him through
his LinkedIn profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now be realistic about the time it might
take him to get back with you because he
[SPEAKER_01]: is actively, you know, working at the
university and he's in the lab every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not like other folks who are sitting
at their computer all day or have PR
[SPEAKER_01]: departments to get back with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you, if you have a question,
if you want to connect or, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or especially if you have an opportunity
for him, um, you can reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, through his LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to, uh, uh, plug two other
episodes because if you like this idea of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of longevity and, uh, nootropics,
uh, you probably also want to check out,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the last episode of shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one Oh eight on longevity and the
endocannabinoid system with hunter land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we talk a lot about keeping your
endocannabinoid system functioning over
[SPEAKER_01]: the arc of your life and things that you
can do to keep your endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: functioning over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then also a shaping fire episode
36, which goes all the way back like three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that is with the fantastic Robert
Littman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an episode on, on breathing on
cannabis and breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to say, I think it's one of my
favorite shaping fire episodes because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the uniqueness and usefulness of the
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about, you know, how we breathe
the common mistakes people make in
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing, um, how breathing in,
um, uh, combusted smoke and vaporizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how that functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, and, uh, he, he offers some
exercises to improve your breathing as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a very delightful episode and
that's shaping fire episode 36.
