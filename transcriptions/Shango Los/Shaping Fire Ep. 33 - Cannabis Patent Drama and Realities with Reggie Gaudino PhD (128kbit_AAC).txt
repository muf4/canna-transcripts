[SPEAKER_00]: Working in any part of the cannabis
industry is arduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter your role, you're going to be
working hard because every single cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: company is a startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies especially to cannabis
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality breeding of stable cannabis
cultivars is a huge amount of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much to simply introduce a
female plant to a male plant and make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, but a serious breeder has a wealth
of experience in cannabis botany,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene, the weather, grower needs,
customer expectations, and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have to put in long hours and
many seasons to sift through seeds to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the best feno possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the damn thing is they're the ones
easiest to rip off because cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics is a wild place with insufficient
regulation, nearly no case law,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at its most basic, it is incredibly
easy to pop a seed of someone else's life
[SPEAKER_00]: work, cross it with some bag seed you
already own, and boom, you have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some folks don't even bother
making that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks just make seed of someone
else's strain, rename it, and sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: right through as if it's their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the shady stuff that happens
before you even get into corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, big ag, and everyone's attorneys
get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis genetics is like its own high
drama TV series that's going to play
[SPEAKER_00]: itself out brutally over the next 15 years
until some best practices get established.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Reggie Gaudino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino is chief science officer at
Steep Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie's a rare one in that he has
expertise in science, law, argumentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a published genetic researcher with
18 years of intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in writing, prosecuting,
and managing patents and patent portfolios
[SPEAKER_00]: in fields as diverse as software and
telecom to biotechnology and molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie received his BS in molecular
biology and PhD in molecular genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: the State University of New York at
Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he conducted four years of postdoc
research at the Washington University in
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Louis studying transcriptional
regulation of ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to be talking about
cannabis patents and other intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Reggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking a big chance of having me
back, so I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the reasons I like having you
on the show, Reggie, is because you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: firebrand and I know you're going to tell
me the truth regardless of its political
[SPEAKER_00]: implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you are willing to come
back and talk some truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I want to start off very at
the top with patents because the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one question or concern that I get from
growers, cannabis enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and breeders all over the country is that,
how can people be patenting cannabis when
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't patent nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, it's just impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, there's a lot of smart
people who are saying that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: things to be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's actually happening that's allowing
people to patent plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little confusing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that you can't patent plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't patent a naturally occurring
plant that you just find in nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: However, cannabis has stopped being a
naturally occurring plant that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: find in nature since we stopped just
growing land races, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as we started breeding and
specifically selecting for higher THC
[SPEAKER_01]: contents, something happened, right,
which is known in patent speak as,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the hand of man, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what ends up happening is that you can
take a naturally occurring plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you do some selective breeding and you
push it in a direction that didn't occur
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's not a naturally occurring
plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a plant that has been bred
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get to that point,
it's no longer a naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be based on nature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what you find in nature and
what you create by a directed breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program are not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's the threshold on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, was the first time
someone took an AFI plant, an Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and crossed it with a Thai plant
and we got AFI Thai, was that first cross
[SPEAKER_00]: of two land races technically patentable
because it didn't happen in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there a threshold to how much you
need to change the land races before it is
[SPEAKER_00]: patentable?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no well-defined threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, you know, if you were to take a
bunch of land races that, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: existed on, you know, you have two
different land races that say one's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's technically a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: land race and one's in Mexico a couple
hundred miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's technically a Mexican land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can pollinate each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to go into that field
where, let's say, some Texas pollen landed
[SPEAKER_01]: in a Mexican field and you were to find
one plant that looked different from all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those plants in that field,
you would be able to take that plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: patent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not the same as what was
growing naturally around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the short answer to your question is,
yes, that very first cross would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: a patentable cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why nobody has
patented cannabis going back is because,
[SPEAKER_01]: not because it's been illegal,
but because the patent office hid behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that it was an illegal plant and
an illegal activity to do anything with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, therefore, they were like,
oh, well, if nobody's going to ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just not going to say, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as anybody called the patent
office and asked the question,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you patent cannabis, the answer was
yes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we get to the question that you're
asking, which is, you know, so when does
[SPEAKER_01]: it stop being a naturally occurring plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops being a naturally occurring plant
when you can find one difference in a
[SPEAKER_01]: field of everything else being the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird that it occurs that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the patent law, especially for
plant patents, if you were to go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: field and found like a thousand of a
certain strain and there's only one of
[SPEAKER_01]: some other strain, that would technically
be patentable because it's novel from all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones that occurred by nature,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a gray area or it's kind
of an ill-defined area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, anything that would not naturally
occur by, you know, in nature would
[SPEAKER_01]: technically be patentable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking a ruderalis or taking an Afghan
tie and making it with a Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_01]: because those things would probably not
happen because of the geographical
[SPEAKER_01]: distance, yes, that is a patentable cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That threshold sounds awfully low,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to ask you to kind of flip
positions because I know that you are a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're a keep the cannabis plant
free person and you want that IP to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hands of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to ask you for a second to
advocate the opposing position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people, you know, as a longtime
cannabis guy and, you know, advocate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the idea of patenting
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I know good people who are moving
in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you just explain what the argument
is from the patent maker's side on why
[SPEAKER_00]: they believe that patenting these genetics
are good for the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you make that case,
we'll take it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start from the perspective of the
investment that's required to create new
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take, you know, you got to
find a suitable germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not in your own germplasm,
right, you have to go buy it or license it
[SPEAKER_01]: from somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a cost associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grow it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to take and find a good,
strong male or, okay, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you have to find a good, strong female
and a good, strong male.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether, and there's a cost associated
with finding those, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to do the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, right, the reason why the
cannabis industry is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: promulgated on the whole idea of clones is
because getting a phenotype and then
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding so that phenotype is pure is a
very difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost never happens in cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in order to get to that point where
you can have, let's say, something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: patentable in a way that you, that really
makes sense to patent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a utility patent gives you the strength
of being able to patent everything
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with that plant from the seed
to extracts to edibles, anything
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has, if it represents that chemical
profile or whatever the claims were for
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular strain, it's covered in
everything that's derived from that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant patent doesn't give you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant patent only gives you that thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you that, what am I trying to
say?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you that, you know, one claim and
it's for the plant as shown as described.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get any chemical information
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get any of these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, you can't protect the
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't protect the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't protect any of that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you get is the vegetative plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are interested in preserving the
entire product line around a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: new strain, you have to go after utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you have to have more than
just plant data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have some chemical analyte
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to describe why it's
novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can see that there's a whole
bunch of investigation that goes into this
[SPEAKER_01]: and a whole bunch of money that goes
behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take an example of Monsanto,
which is, you know, obviously we all
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that the dark lord evil empire,
but the reality is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a very sane business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spend a billion dollars a year in
plant research.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to be able to protect that
investment in research, you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some assurance that you're going to be
able to have the right to be the only one
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell that product because you spent all
the money to make it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at it from that point of
view, it's not necessarily an evil thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going out there and
patenting corn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're patenting corn that they have put
a lot of time and effort and resources
[SPEAKER_01]: into making very special, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unique, different from everybody else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing applies in cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of guys who are trying to
go and build a better turp bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: better cannabinoid bud, this, that,
the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that requires a lot of time and
energy, phenotype hunting, breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to protect the whole entire
thing, you have to get the plant to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where you can have the information
and the genetics and the chemistry to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to patent those things and protect
them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the only way to do that
after you've put all that money and time
[SPEAKER_01]: into it is through a patent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it sounds like a horrible thing
because, you know, we want the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: remain free, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm given a choice between do I
want the plant to remain open source and
[SPEAKER_01]: free, or do I want the people who spent
all their time and energy building this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, having a future revenue stream
when the likes of the Dow and Monsantos
[SPEAKER_01]: come to town and can do everything for
free because it's all open source,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have our guys patent it and
have a future, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yes, you know, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how you look at it,
it could be a bad thing, but it's also the
[SPEAKER_01]: way businesses play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way agricultural, you know,
industries have been built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us to think that in the patent
industry, we're not going to have to play
[SPEAKER_01]: by those rules is, I think, foolish on our
part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me do a quick summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so essentially, like, like most
agriculture, the reason the patent people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are coming in want to patent their
novel versions of strains is because they
[SPEAKER_00]: put a hell of a lot of money doing huge
sorts for genetics and using all this
[SPEAKER_00]: technology assisted, not necessarily GMO,
but just like laboratory testing to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to bring these novel strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, listen, we've put,
you know, six figures into developing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to recoup so that we
can pay off our investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they want to patent it so that they
can preserve some value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, but then, you know, you kind of
shift it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily for what I'm
getting from you, the patents that are
[SPEAKER_00]: bad, it's actually who's going to hold
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds to me like you're also
saying that, um, patenting by the heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to keep it open source is actually
probably a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is who is making the patents?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the green rushers who are coming to
take advantage of these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years of hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I, is it my picking up what you're
putting down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, we need to,
we need to touch base on, on, on a few
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, pieces that, you know,
make it the more, the, the, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: directed argument and that more directed
argument is, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's out there right now, and this is,
you know, patent speak, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a one year bar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So once something is offered for sale,
commercial sale, um, and it doesn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: have to actually be sold, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a contract offering for sale
that's made public and that contract is
[SPEAKER_01]: then not signed, but the contract,
but the offer was made in a public way,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clock starts ticking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's not filed within one year in
the United States, you can't file it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes open source, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, further, if you have any expectations
to be able to patent that strain anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else in the world, you can't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you offer for sale,
you lose the right to file anywhere else
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world other than the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States is the only one that has
that one year window, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so when you look at it from that
perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what should be happening is,
is that these people who have all this
[SPEAKER_01]: open source stuff should be trying to
develop their next, next greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's where you start putting
your fences in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ground, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because anything that's already been sold
is available for everyone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said this the last time we talked,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Monsanto Dow, those guys can go to the
dispensaries and just buy one of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything off of the dispensary shelves
and they don't have to pay a damn thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's open source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they have to do is go pay that $15 or
$20 for that, that cut off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take that back to Monsanto and do
all of their stuff with it, do all their
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, with everything else that they
buy from every other dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you avoid that becoming the
paradigm?
[SPEAKER_01]: You avoid that becoming the paradigm by
those same people who have developed these
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 years of hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they do it the way everyone else does
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their next set of crosses, they do it in a
way that they can track it, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: document it, and then they get some
chemical data and maybe some, some genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: data under their belt and file before they
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes the way we do business in the
cannabis industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the way that we help litter the
ground with patents that are held by the
[SPEAKER_01]: people inside the industry to keep the
green rushers from coming in and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: everything away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like the way that,
um, you know, people continue to look back
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I made these strains that I'm in
love with over the last 10 or 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that looking back and trying to
preserve those is not the successful path
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the successful path forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to look into the future and either
create new crosses that are based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: old school genetics or just move forward
with new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to what, what,
you know, what have you done for me
[SPEAKER_00]: lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, what are you doing that's
new and novel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where breeders should be
putting their attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I want to, I want to say in order
to make this really a rock solid kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for us, those same people who are
going to be working on the new genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and working off of their own, their old
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where kind of somebody has to
absorb the cost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to sound horrible,
but a lot of this is only partially
[SPEAKER_01]: successful unless somebody, anybody,
everybody, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chips in and we can identify the genetics
that are already exist and try to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: name on them or a sequence to them or
something so that we can say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the database that we started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that exists in this database,
Monsanto or Dow or whatever, they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: just come in and say, oh, look,
this is a new strain that we made
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we'll have the information that
says, ah, sorry, that exists already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's a twofold approach cataloging
what exists so that we know where we
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving forward in a way that
allows us to protect the new stuff and do
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a way that allows us to get there
before the likes of the big Ag people
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we protect, you know,
the industry from the patent perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it kind of, you know,
within the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we don't do that, I know it
sounds gloom and doom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said the same thing last time,
it sounds gloom and doom, but without
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, it really becomes a free
for all, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't need a free for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want is to be able to protect what
we've built and then have a stake in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry as it grows and moves forward,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a free for all, I can guarantee
the likes of Monsanto and Dow and Syngenta
[SPEAKER_01]: and all those people who decide to come
in, they do it better, faster and more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately than we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that's what they do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to protect it because we know
what will happen when they come,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So time to get the head out of the sand
and play this game like any big business
[SPEAKER_01]: would play this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds so expensive to, you know,
determine the code of the genome of each
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that everybody has developed that
they want to preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how much does it cost to do that
kind of analysis per strain nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so there are different levels of
genetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can some of it is targeted
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is is short read, you know,
whole genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is long enough to put in your
patent and protect your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so that's a great question,
because I'm going to give you the here's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the other shoe drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about is what I would
call responsible patenting in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had to do this in any other
agriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is, is that because there's
no other plant on the planet that is as
[SPEAKER_01]: complex and has as many active compounds
as cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally when you take, like,
say, let's say corn and you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't you don't do GMO, but you do
directed breeding to increase the sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: content or to make it, you know,
so it has, you know, when you pop it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has bigger kernels or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those things can be achieved by
just, you know, directed breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but but at the end of the day,
you're changing one component or you're or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at one component.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're looking at a change in
the sugar content or a change in the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of the kernel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we are faced with a with a plant
that has 500 active compounds and we are
[SPEAKER_01]: only looking at a couple CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so when you have 500 active compounds
and you're only looking at two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, how do you get any granularity
in five or six or seven hundred or a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
if you don't look at enough compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all overlap, which is exactly what we
see right now in the patent record of
[SPEAKER_01]: those strains that have already been filed
on and issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all have kind of because they're
only looking at a couple of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of overlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so what has to happen is and
actually it's funny that we're having this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation because on Friday this week
I'm actually talking in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: American Intellectual Property Lawyers
Association exactly on the pitfalls to
[SPEAKER_01]: successful patenting in cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and one of the points that I make is
that, you know, when you can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, you take, you know, the same
genetics and you grow it in five different
[SPEAKER_01]: places with or five different conditions
and you get five different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: answers that that tells you that you need
to go deeper than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does the genetics look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now because of the the paradigm or
or the you know, the only equation that
[SPEAKER_01]: really that biologists ever use is
genotype plus environment equals
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's the basic, you know,
biology math for us because I always think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it as nature versus nurture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so now but the problem is, is that so
we already know that even the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot define a specific chemical analyte
output.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the same genetics grown in four
different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gave me four different responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that responsible patenting
so that you can protect a strain and a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular set of genetics and a
particular chemical outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you have to include in that
claim the way you grew it, because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't grow it that way, it comes out with
a different output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so now we're looking at a plant that is
unique unto itself in terms of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go about patenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we are in the dark ages
right now, because patent examiners and
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent office don't understand
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't see these problems because
they've never had to deal with these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems because no other commercial
agricultural plant has been the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been let's change this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's change that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're not really trying to change
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of are trying to change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know where we started and we
don't have a defined endpoint because any
[SPEAKER_01]: given genetics can do any different thing
depending on how you grow it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the only way to get successful and,
you know, forward looking patents that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to have people going after
specific strains that do specific things
[SPEAKER_01]: is to have a level of detail that has
never been asked for in plant patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're looking at trying to
force a change on the patent office and
[SPEAKER_01]: why I'm going to go speak to the AIPLA on
Fridays, because, you know, this is this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a huge thing that people in the patent
office who are issuing these patents don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They clearly don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also don't understand that when we
call something a strain, we have not done
[SPEAKER_01]: the stable the stabilization that is
almost always part of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so we're trying to put cannabis into
plant patents and utility plant patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that have been crafted around a
certain paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis does not fit at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we have we we got a lot of work to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it would be very good if the
people on the cannabis side understood and
[SPEAKER_01]: helped educate by going the extra mile,
providing the data to the patent office
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm talking about so that it's
already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps create the way things have to
be done, because otherwise we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: end up with the kind of patents we already
have have, you know, issued that came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Biotech Institute LLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I know that's another topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to jump into our next
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, but a direct result,
you know, of not understanding how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this correctly is what we see with those
patents that were already issued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about Biotech
Institute after the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go to the first break,
I just want to get a number out of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know that there's people who are
listening, who see themselves as wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect the genetics that they've
worked hard on now and going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're referring to the the kind and
amount of data that you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: send to the patent office.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the price tag to get that research
done for one cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for one cultivar and, you know,
and again, I said there's different levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of analysis and that's just give me a
ballpark figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere between, I'd say, five hundred
to five thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and let me let me say why it's so
wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the type of strain you're
dealing with, you may be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something which is called targeted
sequencing because you know why it's
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have to look there and say,
look, all these other strains have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain has this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do, however, a regular let's take
what which is what most of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take that female in this male and or
maybe that female and three or four males
[SPEAKER_01]: and throw them into a room together and
see what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're looking at a situation where
in order to get the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to go much deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to sequence much deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deeper the level of sequencing,
the more it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add to that whether or not
you're doing it for for private commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: use or for public domain use.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of at least in the programs that
we offer at Steep Hill, we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial price and then a research
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been able to secure through our
partner that if the data that we generate
[SPEAKER_01]: is donated to the public domain so that we
can use it in a publication after you file
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we let you do what you're going to
do first and we use it and accumulate the
[SPEAKER_01]: data and then we publish publish it later
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an issue for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can offer a much cheaper price because
it goes into the research domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's typically half price that
gets you between fifteen hundred and two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand dollars for a whole genome
sequencing of a long read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five thousand would be the single the
single cultivar price where you keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself and nobody else has it but
you and your patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's the prices that I've been
given to work with through the university
[SPEAKER_01]: that I partner with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but that's for long read.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always need long read.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are using strains that are already
decently characterized and now you just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to find in a couple of regions where
the differences might lie because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken strain and strain but you put them
together and you want to see what unique
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of A and B they got together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do short read sequencing which
comes in at you know around 800 to a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand and then there's targeted
sequencing which just looks at specific
[SPEAKER_01]: genes and comes in around 300 to 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that's why there's that wide range
but it's based on what you need and and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're trying to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be parroting those words from
you a lot over the next six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be assure you of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Reggie Gaudino chief
[SPEAKER_00]: science officer and director of genetics
and intellectual property at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry people everywhere are looking for
the purest terpenes without adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum and that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic non GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they are extracted from real
plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind used
during the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact terpenes from true terpenes are so
pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is other companies terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you stack those terpenes to make a
blend you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also has strain specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin poison, sunset sherbet
and granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before you
know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high or if you want to
dab some alpha-pinene so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of shapingfire you already
understand the importance of living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate you go way beyond simply
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing with nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone making
for higher yields and thriving flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by out competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a US
university and has been extensively tested
[SPEAKER_00]: by Colorado growers and independent
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is Reggie Gaudino, Chief Science
[SPEAKER_00]: Officer and Director of Genetics and
Intellectual Property at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first break we talked about
not only why people generally in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry don't really have a good
grasp of what's going on patenting but
[SPEAKER_00]: even more so this is happening at the
patent and trade office as well and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they are issuing patents that are dare I
say incomplete and when and may not stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up and so Reggie you talked a little bit
about that but let's really hit that hard
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first time I heard you talk about
this was in that article that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: last fall in September of 2017 in GQ
Magazine titled The Great Pot Monopoly
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystery written by Amanda Chicago Lewis
and it blew everybody away and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I had talked about patents
generally earlier on on the podcast but
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly this article that kind of went
down a rabbit hole of he said she said
[SPEAKER_00]: about patents that were starting to place
take place freaked out everybody but
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly nobody had any actual information
so it was all like rumor mill and gossip
[SPEAKER_00]: upon gossip and I hate that stuff but but
in that GQ article you an email that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote is mentioned that you wrote to some
of the other heavy players in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: waving your hand and raising a red flag to
these new patents that you saw coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: and why this needed to be addressed
immediately to keep an open market so will
[SPEAKER_00]: you take us back to that time and explain
what was in the email and why you felt so
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated to get the word out yeah so okay
so I have besides being you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist the reason I'm actually a
director of intellectual property is
[SPEAKER_01]: because for the last 22 years that's what
I have done right in the biotech sector
[SPEAKER_01]: written and or managed portfolios and I
and before I came to steep hill I was the
[SPEAKER_01]: senior patent agent at sequinome right so
and so you know the first thing I did when
[SPEAKER_01]: I came to the industry was like okay you
know let's see what the patent landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like because I'm about to embark on
some research as the director of genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't want to know what's out there
what I'm up against right what pitfalls to
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid so you know I did what any decent
patent practitioner would do and you do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know your your patent arena searches
patent ability searches you know what just
[SPEAKER_01]: general landscaping to see what the
industry looks like and in that initial
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis I found you know at the time it
was only three applications that had been
[SPEAKER_01]: submitted by the biotech Institute LLC you
know and my you know and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting because they were they were
hidden patents right so it was you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: method patent under breeding and I forget
the title and we can look it up afterwards
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know but it was essentially it was
breeding cultivation so on and so forth
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for you know Pat you know for
cannabis right when I went through the
[SPEAKER_01]: claims and this is this is a a pro tip
okay so don't ever pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_01]: the title of a patent says because they're
purposely written to be vague and and
[SPEAKER_01]: misleading okay so you can't ever tell
what's gonna be in a patent from looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the title you have to look at the claim
structure right so when I did my search I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually was looking for things that had
cannabis or marijuana in the claims and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I filtered it down from there and and
in that filtering process I found these
[SPEAKER_01]: three patent applications and when I
looked at the claims my jaw had hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor because the first one I looked at
was a hybrid cannabis plant having a BT
[SPEAKER_01]: slash BD phenotype what does that mean
right so there was a few other things
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to it but BT BD just means that
it can make both you know it's the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: you know nomenclature that we use for
specific genotype slash phenotypes in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis so BT is THC dominant BD is CBD
dominant BT BD mean it's a heteros ligate
[SPEAKER_01]: means that it can make both THC and CBD so
that claim structure the way it was
[SPEAKER_01]: written was basically claiming anything
that could make THC and CBD well holy crap
[SPEAKER_01]: dude that's like it that's the entire
medicinal cannabis industry right so right
[SPEAKER_01]: so so that was a bit on the alarming side
and and so I you know looked at them I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to some other people in the
industry and and and none of them think
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that they were existent right so like
literally everybody talked to had no clue
[SPEAKER_01]: they were there right and as I said they
were still applications at the time they
[SPEAKER_01]: had not been issued so while they were
still applications I started to contact
[SPEAKER_01]: people like Steve D'Angelo and some other
people and I think what really happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: the very beginning was is that you know we
were so concerned about rescheduling that
[SPEAKER_01]: people weren't really paying attention to
this even though I was making I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to some people about it it was in
the height of the whole rescheduling thing
[SPEAKER_01]: right so like two years ago and so people
just didn't understand or just didn't care
[SPEAKER_01]: and because of that nothing was done and
then the first patent issued and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: the one word there was the BT sub BD
phenotype that and and the limitations
[SPEAKER_01]: were where it had to have at least three
percent THC a or THC and at least three
[SPEAKER_01]: percent CBD and at least one percent
terpenes right well I'm sorry but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a cannabis grower and you can't hit
three percent THC and three percent CBD or
[SPEAKER_01]: one percent terpenes you shouldn't be a
cannabis grower right like like honestly
[SPEAKER_01]: right so so the limitations ended up not
being limitations right and so this is
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm going with this whole thing
right so because the patents themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: were actually written quite well they look
just like any other good plant utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patent which means that it was done by a
reputable firm with a good patent lawyer
[SPEAKER_01]: right if I had written these claims myself
or these patents myself I would have done
[SPEAKER_01]: it exactly the same way so the patents are
well written and therefore that means that
[SPEAKER_01]: the claims that were issued are bona fide
claims that will be hard to challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: right so so that's part number one it's a
it's a well written patent and if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: done it I would have done it the same way
right so now how did they get over on the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent office they got over on the patent
office because it looks like a patent the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant patent it has limitations that if
you don't know the industry look like
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations so when you say one percent
terpenes where beta-mercine is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant terpene right well anybody who's
a cannabis grower knows that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate the terpene profile by the
growing regime right so right so so now we
[SPEAKER_01]: have limitations in claims that are not
limitations and they were not caught by
[SPEAKER_01]: the patent office because the patent
office doesn't understand cannabis right
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the experience they don't
have the experience to realize it's over
[SPEAKER_00]: broad they're like oh it reads okay but
they don't have any sense of context right
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is exactly what happens any time
a new arena is opened up in the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: office this is not unique to this when we
went to molecular die DNA based
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnostics a lot of crappy patents were
issued then too and when we went to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know different types of engineering though
you know when we opened up business method
[SPEAKER_01]: patents every time a new arena of patents
is opened because there's nobody who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: how to examine them the same exact thing
happened so the fact that this happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry is not the issue
right because it happens in all industries
[SPEAKER_01]: where there is not enough expertise for
the patent examiners right I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: during the dot-com boom you know there was
a patent for it clicking on an image that
[SPEAKER_00]: took you to a advertiser's website you
know they're like patting that it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: well that's that's the entirety of the
internet you know yep exactly right so so
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's because you have a weakness in
the examiner force that doesn't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the incoming new technology right that's
exactly what happened here so they saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant patent that looked like a bona fide
plant patent but it was applied to f1s
[SPEAKER_01]: well in any other agricultural you know
domain you don't patent an f1 you patent a
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized true breeding strain because
that's how you get your ROI right so
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsanto doesn't sell f1s Monsanto sells
stabilized true breeding strains that have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone to the point where you may not even
be able to get you know fertile seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: the cross right so so that's how how deep
they go into these things right and so
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't do that in the cannabis
industry right but the patent office
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't understand they don't do that well
what happened they issue patents that look
[SPEAKER_01]: right but can't possibly be right because
they're f1s and we don't do any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: other stabilization right so so this is
where one of those things where a patent
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioner saw and I'm not trying to
call the guy out but I guess I kind of am
[SPEAKER_01]: right so when I saw it I was actually
really offended that a patent practitioner
[SPEAKER_01]: would pull the wool over the patent office
eyes like that but then again it's because
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it and I wasn't first right so
he somebody beat me to the punch and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't say that it's not sour grapes right
so because as I said it's a well-written
[SPEAKER_01]: patent and I would have probably done the
same thing and you know even though all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us who haven't done it are all you know
bent out of shape about it you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have to give the person like ball
or credit I mean that's a freaking hustle
[SPEAKER_00]: you know to have to have your your I mean
I don't like it and I'm you know I work
[SPEAKER_00]: against it but you also got to be
impressed like dang yo that's some game
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah absolutely and to and to have the
balls dude it was like and what balls he
[SPEAKER_01]: has to pull that one off into you know
it's like putting your arms around the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole cake and saying this is all mine
exactly dude exactly so so but you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: and I guess you know two things though
right so as of right now the patents are
[SPEAKER_01]: really teethless right so so in any good
regime right enforcement has to have teeth
[SPEAKER_01]: right so you can't really enforce anything
because it's still schedule one so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal right so they have these
patents and until it gets switched to they
[SPEAKER_01]: can enforce it the patents really may not
mean much right but we know it's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to take 20 years so the
patents will still be enforced when that
[SPEAKER_01]: time comes and then we have an issue right
so then we have to see whether or not it
[SPEAKER_01]: can be challenged because they're invalid
so the question then becomes is who's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to put the money up for that and
that's kind of where everything fell apart
[SPEAKER_01]: because we started this part of the talk
about my letter right so I wrote the
[SPEAKER_01]: letter where I did this analysis and I
looked at all the claims and I said well
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the potential impact and the
potential impact is large right because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at all THC CBD producing
strains right and that's the focus of most
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis now one-to-one ratios
you know two to one one to twos what but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's you know always THC CBD hybrids tend
to be the most interesting for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal aspect of cannabis you know you
now have a situation where a good 50 to 75
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of potentially all medicinal
cannabis moving forward is claimed right
[SPEAKER_01]: but it gets worse because that was just
the first one that came out down the
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline pipeline right they now have
three actually I have four now so since
[SPEAKER_01]: then three other members of this portfolio
have issued they now have four issued
[SPEAKER_01]: patents which means that it's even a
harder job to invalidate them and the
[SPEAKER_01]: patents have become even broader so now
they have one that's a medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patent it doesn't even claim the phenotype
right there's no BTB B sub T B sub D in it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a hybrid cannabis plant making
at least 1.5% THC a and 2% or 3% whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers were right so they even took
out the requirement for that genetic you
[SPEAKER_01]: know limitation so is it possible under
certain growing conditions to get a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant plant to produce CBD well yeah
it's probably possible to do that right
[SPEAKER_01]: would it fall under the B sub T B sub D
genotype technically it might but it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have to if if it's a trick of you
know for instance you know let's look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the other way high CBD plants right you
get to a point with high CBD plants where
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter you know how hard you
try you will get some THC produced right
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know I could imagine that there are
probably THC dominant plants that do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing right so so now think about
this that means that somebody with
[SPEAKER_01]: completely unrelated genetics to the
genetics that went into the patent could
[SPEAKER_01]: infringe because they happen to grow their
their own genetics the wrong way so in my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind that's not what the patent office
meant to do right that that's just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly be possible right that some guy
inadvertently not even you know using the
[SPEAKER_01]: same starting genetics is is um you know
it's going to be you know on the hook for
[SPEAKER_01]: this right it can't be right and and the
way things are written now it that's
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the way it works and it and so we
got to do something about it absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do something about it and I would
think that after they got their first
[SPEAKER_00]: patent and it was overbroad and after
everybody was done drinking their
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne they're like well what can we do
now and so they come with three more that
[SPEAKER_00]: are increasingly even more broad and
they're probably expecting some pushback
[SPEAKER_00]: but my goodness they've they've taken so
much real estate of the industry at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning everyone who wants to play
defense has to push them that much farther
[SPEAKER_00]: back now and there's probably some amount
of their patents being reinforcing right
[SPEAKER_00]: like once you have one if you have four it
makes your first one look better yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely there there is that so and you
get to kind of back door into protection
[SPEAKER_01]: well we didn't get it there but we had
this other one that has this and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: there but now they have to invalidate to
right so and the more patents in suit the
[SPEAKER_01]: more expensive it becomes right so you
know and then think about it this way
[SPEAKER_01]: right so he's got these things in hand
right if somebody is going to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge him what do you do you go get a
deep pocket partner like Monsanto hey help
[SPEAKER_01]: me help me fight these things off and I'll
you know let you use the patents or you or
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy them cheaper you know whatever
so you know there's all sorts of possible
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios right and the only reason I
bring up those scenarios is because if at
[SPEAKER_01]: any point the idea was for them to get
these things to protect the industry from
[SPEAKER_01]: the likes of those big ad companies you'd
think that now that they have four they
[SPEAKER_01]: would have donated it to the public domain
already which they have not done which
[SPEAKER_01]: tells me that they're in this for their
own personal gain right so yeah that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting point too right like you know
these overly broad patents if if we had
[SPEAKER_00]: them and they were in the public domain
we'd be like oh these are really good
[SPEAKER_00]: patents they're very broad and they
protect you know medical marijuana now and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future that's great but since
somebody else has got them and looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're motivated by profit and could
potentially flip it to a you know mega
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture that that that suddenly it
looks way less way less attractive well
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and way less like it was done for
the correct you know philanthropic reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: right so this is definitely this wasn't
done in the best industry of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: at least yeah right on so so let's let's
go back to your original email before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the second break here oh yeah your
your original email was looking to like
[SPEAKER_00]: like sound the alarm raise the flag bang
the drum that this was going on and from
[SPEAKER_00]: what I know about you I'm assuming that
your kind of point of your email that you
[SPEAKER_00]: sent out to to these big industry players
where hey we need to pull together right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and do some fundraising and stand up
to this because we're either gonna a need
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of money to do do the the
the long read on the present cultivars to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect them or B and more likely
somebody's gonna have to stage you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit to to quash these patents when
they become enforceable and and with that
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption that's what you were trying to
get people to consider did anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: consider I mean is there anybody working
on that it seems like a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: participation and cooperation that our
industry hasn't quite pulled off yet so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know me very well shanko because
that's exactly what I did so yeah so I put
[SPEAKER_01]: together the letter I sent it around I
went to the people like you know Steve D
[SPEAKER_01]: 'Angelo Steve D'Angelo pulled some people
together I ended up speaking to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: at one point who was campaign advisor to
Hillary Clinton we tried to put it on into
[SPEAKER_01]: that domain to get it to be publicized
that way they weren't interested because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was too controversial a topic I put
together a seminar at the new West Summit
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you you know there they
help hold that it's you know kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the financial kind of you know that big
data kind of meeting for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry it's held every year and so two
two years ago I did exactly that I did a
[SPEAKER_01]: seminar on the patents and then by
invitation only right the we had gathered
[SPEAKER_01]: using new frontier the data company we had
get and we had gathered a number of people
[SPEAKER_01]: for a private seminar that occurred
afterwards it was another two-hour session
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that session I had actually brought
in an outside law firm I brought in
[SPEAKER_01]: Morrison Foster because we we have
dealings with them and and I had them give
[SPEAKER_01]: a the perspective of what it would take to
challenge the patents the kind of money
[SPEAKER_01]: the the approach because you know
challenging you know a validity of a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent in the court of law is expensive
right so there are lesser expensive ways
[SPEAKER_01]: called into partage review or expertise
review there there there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: available through the patent office that
come in way cheaper but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day it was still going to cost between
three hundred to seven hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars right and they were asking that a
war chest be put together of at least like
[SPEAKER_01]: half a million dollars so they could go
through and do the whole entire thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: and as soon as they came to the number
part the entire meeting broke down and it
[SPEAKER_01]: became a discussion of well who's going to
contribute and what about the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't contribute because they're going to
get benefit anyway so they're good what do
[SPEAKER_01]: we do about the free riders and and
literally it became more about how to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know who was going to put in what and and
how how the people who put in what they
[SPEAKER_01]: put in we're going to benefit more than
the people who didn't put anything else
[SPEAKER_01]: who were the free riders and I and I
couldn't believe it I like looked at the
[SPEAKER_01]: room as it devolved into this side
conversation and I was like holy shit dude
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on here right I I sorry I
thought I turned that off I literally was
[SPEAKER_00]: floored right and how you right because
the position that you're bringing to them
[SPEAKER_00]: is is you know somebody's trying to take
the whole pie we want to make the pie
[SPEAKER_00]: available to everybody do we want to do
this and they're like yeah but if we pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for it we want the whole pie right right
so and so what ended up happening was
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing absolutely nothing so I so and it
was interesting because you know the GQ
[SPEAKER_01]: article talks about Mowgli and and how
Mowgli went to you know Amanda well I had
[SPEAKER_01]: actually talked to Amanda about this
previously and I was actually the one who
[SPEAKER_01]: actually told told Mowgli about it and
Mowgli and I were kind of at opposite ends
[SPEAKER_01]: of this thing for a while even publicly
when we finally realized I'm like dude you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're saying the same thing you want
them to protect stuff now to keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: away I'm telling them that they should
protect stuff now the way to do it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: patent it before other people patent
you're against patents but at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day we want the same thing we want the
industry protected you know you seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: think it can be done a certain way I know
patents a little bit better and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you we should do it this way I
mean knowing both you and Mowgli Holmes
[SPEAKER_00]: from Filos Biosciences I can see how you
guys probably approach this differently
[SPEAKER_00]: you're all like let's defensively patent
it and he's all like patents suck and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: see and I agree with both of those right
and so I can see how it probably took you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys a little bit of you know mental
jostling to find out you're actually on
[SPEAKER_01]: the same page right and I just for the
record I love Mowgli dude Mowgli is an
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome dude and I love talking to him and
he and I you know have you know a deep
[SPEAKER_01]: respect for each other right so and so you
know it was important for me to for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: make him understand what I was trying to
say right I'm like dude I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell people to patent stuff to keep it
from being open source I'm trying to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them to patent stuff because if they don't
they won't have anything left right so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so and at the end of the day I said
by the way if we all patent stuff and we
[SPEAKER_01]: say that you know and we can let anybody
we want to use those patents for free
[SPEAKER_01]: right so once we own a patent we can give
anybody the right to do anything we want
[SPEAKER_01]: with it right but by having that patent
you keep the people you don't want from
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it from doing it right so so this
way at least we have some control right
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's all I was trying to do is like
make sure that we in the industry maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: control of what we spent so long building
because dude these guys are going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and with their fancy labs and whatever
they're kind of like like like literally
[SPEAKER_01]: out compete us in the matter of years
right the amount of money that these big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies can dump in with their you know
thousands of scientists on their payroll
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no way the industry can compete if
they get into it right the only way to
[SPEAKER_01]: slow them down is to put up all these
picket fences and say and make a field
[SPEAKER_01]: full of landmines that they have to
negotiate around right that's how you slow
[SPEAKER_00]: them down we're gonna take a short break
and be right back you are listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire and my guest today is Reggie
Gaudino chief science officer and director
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetics and intellectual property at
Steep Hill if you own a cannabis company
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that finding good business
partners vendors and allies is an
[SPEAKER_00]: essential part of your role and building
your business in a new industry like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis doesn't always make that easy
Canna Con is coming to Boston and Detroit
[SPEAKER_00]: this summer and the halls will be filled
with every kind of ally you need for a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company technology horticulture
packaging marketing legal human resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and media everything you need for your
business will be there and your customers
[SPEAKER_00]: will be there too because Canna Con is a
premier cannabis business and networking
[SPEAKER_00]: event with nationally recognized speakers
and the opportunity to have serious
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with your business peers and
investors reserving yourself a booth at
[SPEAKER_00]: Canna Con can unlock a lot of doors for
you not only do you get to network with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the people who pass your booth but it
is not uncommon for Canna Con vendors to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a million dollars in business during
the event Canna Con Seattle event in
[SPEAKER_00]: February sold out well in advance so
reserve your booths now for Detroit June
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st and 2nd and Boston July 27th and 28th
attendee tickets are still available for
[SPEAKER_00]: both events whether you reserve a booth or
attend just for a day do not miss the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to become a serious player in
your market visit Canna Con org for
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets booth reservations and more
information that's Canna Con org while I
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly still enjoy smoking joints I
moved over to using vaporizers about three
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago the high was a little different
than burning the flower and in the end I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided I preferred it for daily use
especially because I have asthma more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly though I could taste my flower
so much more it's hard to express to you
[SPEAKER_00]: how significantly different cannabis with
a good terpene profile tastes when vaped
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of burned I have brought my vape
with me to visit growers and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: astonished by the clarity of taste and
they say they feel like they're tasting
[SPEAKER_00]: their flower for the very first time the
air vape vaporizer from air vape usa.com
[SPEAKER_00]: is a great device to use on the go or at
home when you pick it up it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying like a medical device it isn't
flimsy like many vapes are I like how the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is inserted in the top instead of
the bottom so travels a shorter path to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth with the cannabis at the top I get a
hit that feels more substantial even
[SPEAKER_00]: though I'm just inhaling vapor and not
full-bodied smoke since I use this vape
[SPEAKER_00]: for flower hash and concentrates I really
like that the digital control for the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is right there on the front
three clicks of the button and it fires up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the temperature I specify really
quickly and discreetly you know vape
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates are milder experience than
dabbing but you still get the potency in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hit also the taste is great as would
be expected with a low temp dab I love
[SPEAKER_00]: that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that way if I'm chatting or
distracted while it's heating up it lets
[SPEAKER_00]: me know when it's ready if you are ready
for a nice pocket-sized vaporizer consider
[SPEAKER_00]: the air vape the new air vape X has just
come out and it's gorgeous and includes
[SPEAKER_00]: many updates you can find more about the
air vape vaporizer at airvapeusa.com
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back you are listening to shaping
fire I'm your host Shango Loos and our
[SPEAKER_00]: guest this week is Reggie Gaudino chief
science officer and director of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and intellectual property at Steep Hill so
wow we have shaken a lot of trees so far
[SPEAKER_00]: so we talked about why you know patenting
people don't understand it and even the
[SPEAKER_00]: patent office is and yet there's still
some patents that are coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not going to likely be held in the
open sector so that's all a drag but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some people have successfully
licensed their strains because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to you know advance and make some
money off of their life's work some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: more successful than others and I know
that when I was at Emerald Cup this year
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody was talking about this
particular company Napro research because
[SPEAKER_00]: several of the winning strains were
licensed from them and so you know as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know cannabis people are everybody was was
uninformed Lee talking crap about Napro
[SPEAKER_00]: research with without actually knowing
what they do and so let's talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about the licensing of strains Reggie
you know where where are we at now I have
[SPEAKER_00]: people successfully proven that you know
that they own the strains that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed them themselves and then are
successfully getting fees from company for
[SPEAKER_01]: using those genetics so there you've got a
lot of questions there some of which I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't answer but what I can answer is that
yeah you can actually use the same you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we were talking about DNA sequencing
earlier and and what you need to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent well it's the same information that
you would use for licensing right so and
[SPEAKER_01]: this gets back to being able to prove
what's out there and what's not out there
[SPEAKER_01]: right so if you as let's say a company
want to have you know a business where you
[SPEAKER_01]: build new strains and then license them as
your you know as your business model what
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up doing is you you get your
germplasm you do genetic analysis on your
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm right and you can and and it's
probably a good idea to do genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis on other you know related or non
related germplasm just to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish a baseline right and by genetic
analysis I don't necessarily mean always
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing although sequencing is the
epitome of genetic analysis right so but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know once you have this basal
information the same information we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about you know what the cannabis industry
needs you then start your breeding program
[SPEAKER_01]: right and so now because you have the
starting material and now you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: your f1s or your even you know your later
hybrids right so you can now do an
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis where you say okay this is what
my offspring look like this is what the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents look like here's what some other
random things look like look at my
[SPEAKER_01]: differences those differences are going to
boil down to what a call the single
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleotide polymorphism or or variance
right so at any given nucleotide type
[SPEAKER_01]: position there's a possibility you will
have a change there a polymorphism or a
[SPEAKER_01]: variant right so so when you develop a new
strain even if you said that you take
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say you take you know you know
Afghani and you cross it with you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a lamb's bread so you get you end up
an Afghani bread right so whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that well you can see what
the snip calls will be in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani you'll see what the snip calls
will be in the you know Jamaican lambs
[SPEAKER_01]: bread you'll see the where they overlap
where they have the same snip calls you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see where they have the different snip
calls right and in that population will
[SPEAKER_01]: then be a unique snip table that's unique
to that new germplasm which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring of you know a plus b right and
every time you build a new strain you will
[SPEAKER_01]: end up with a new variant call table right
and that variant call table is the proof
[SPEAKER_01]: behind which you can say look this is
unique to this nothing else has it sells
[SPEAKER_01]: that and you're not part of that license
agreement or whatever you can go in
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement enforce it because you have
this unique thing it you only gave it to
[SPEAKER_01]: this person under contract if it gets out
from that person that means that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: breached that contract so we are seeing a
lot more companies ask exactly for this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of analysis as the basis of licensing
because they see licensing as the quick
[SPEAKER_01]: fix to patenting and it's actually pretty
a pretty good approximation right so
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can put these people under
contract and you can enforce that contract
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know regardless of whether you
can enforce cannabis infringement at the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent level you have a contract under
which you have set some terms right and if
[SPEAKER_01]: they breach that contract it doesn't
matter what the what the the breach was
[SPEAKER_01]: they've breached the contract right so if
the contract says you can't trade that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant because it's mine and they do it
anyway it doesn't matter that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because that's not what you're
that's not the the that's not what the
[SPEAKER_01]: contract was is broken over the contract
was broken over because you did something
[SPEAKER_01]: you weren't supposed to do and under the
terms of the contract right so I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere there will be some judge that
will try to throw it out because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: based on cannabis but realistically this
is contract law and it's not patent law
[SPEAKER_01]: right so the contract says you can't do
this if you didn't that then you've broken
[SPEAKER_01]: the contract so the fact that you did it
with cannabis should be irrelevant so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like layered interests like yeah to be
able to license it they need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: already patented it but the patented part
is not no the nature of the oh you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to patent it to be able to license
you just need to be able to line up no
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely not oh that's interesting
exactly so once you so wow so this is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a poor man's patent you can get
the analysis done and and show where the I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you called it a clip point you know
see that those line up thus proving that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the genetics that you did your work
on and that is enough for you to start
[SPEAKER_01]: charging licensing fees right so now so
here's where here's where the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in because this only works if you
have stabilized your genetics and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: prove but if you're just trying to sell an
f1 somebody else can create the same it
[SPEAKER_01]: can create an f1 possibly create it with
different genetics and end up at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring right so this is why stabilized
genetics and true breeding genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: the paradigm in plant you know
agricultural you know business right
[SPEAKER_01]: because the only way to ensure that
somebody doesn't get there self it or
[SPEAKER_01]: cross it he loses it right so so this is
why again we want as an industry to move
[SPEAKER_01]: towards seed-based growing and genetics
right so f1s are great when you find
[SPEAKER_01]: something but it should not be the be all
and end all it should be the oh great I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a great f1 now let me do the work to
make sure that I can find the true
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and stabilize it so then it
becomes my unique plant that I can then
[SPEAKER_00]: protect so let me ask you a question
drilling into that a little bit Reggie so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I have heard a couple people say
that commercial cannabis agriculture will
[SPEAKER_00]: always be a clone or cut based because you
cannot get the you know seeds to be
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform enough for commercial monocropping
and for me I don't think that sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth I think that with more work you
and moving beyond f1 working with
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial labs and stuff people will be
able to stabilize seeds enough so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use a seed get the vigorous
growth and yet have each of the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field be similar enough that they can
handle them as a commodity would you do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think do you agree that that there's
you know it just takes a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe not a little maybe a lot more
work to stabilize these seeds and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the industry is going to be well I
would I would say yes so so when if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had asked me without all the other stuff
if I thought that was true I'd say that's
[SPEAKER_01]: complete and total bullshit right so
complete and total bullshit and whoever
[SPEAKER_01]: says that is clearly not a geneticist or a
true you know plant breeder right and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hate to be the dick to say that but that's
I mean I hear stuff like that it drives me
[SPEAKER_01]: batty right so so you know any plant can
be stabilized does it take a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes yes right and will it take
longer if you don't have genetic tools
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely right but this is why you have
cannabis companies like myself and files
[SPEAKER_01]: and others that are doing this work so
that we can build breeding markers and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not and it's not just the breeding
markers for THC and CBD because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's baby shit really that's the
low-hanging fruit that and and people need
[SPEAKER_01]: to also realize that you could only breed
so much THC and CBD into a you know output
[SPEAKER_01]: in a plant before the plant gets sick and
doesn't grow well in which case then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have an all over overall deal right so do
you want a plant that puts out 40% but
[SPEAKER_01]: grows poorly or a plant that puts out 28%
and grows like gangbusters so your overall
[SPEAKER_01]: one acre yield is much higher right so
these are the kind of things that people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are not plant biologists and plant you
know in the plant agricultural you know
[SPEAKER_01]: technology don't understand these things
right so so what is it that we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to actually find all the
other genes that are not THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: because in order to make a plant that has
more THC and CBD you got to build it from
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground up you have to have it so it
has more biomass so that it has you know
[SPEAKER_01]: longer flowering time and all these other
things right so to blindly look at just
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a gene family and think you're
gonna make a better plant that way is is
[SPEAKER_01]: is not doing it the right way right so now
when you look at it from that perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: you need the breeding tools so that you
can grow an overall healthier better yield
[SPEAKER_01]: in plant that has an increase in
everything right and that is what the the
[SPEAKER_01]: object of you know building stabilized
genetics and true breeding genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's done in every plant because it
can be done in every plant it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of organization and and dedication
right and now you and now you can add to
[SPEAKER_01]: that marker assisted breeding because we
have moved into the realm of where almost
[SPEAKER_01]: every commercial crop has been sequenced
we have markers that we can follow and now
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do rapid generation cycling and we
can do other things that help us build
[SPEAKER_01]: better plants faster right so all of these
things are done already and can be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis right on so you you got my
attention when you said you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: dedication and the efficiency or drive
whatever you said about you know getting
[SPEAKER_00]: this done and i think that this is one of
the ways places that i get a little torn
[SPEAKER_00]: about licensing of strains because you
know the whole show we've been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how we want you know the the the the
over broad cannabis patent to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: open domain so that everyone can use it
and and it doesn't because become
[SPEAKER_00]: individualized ip but at the same time you
know you've got companies and and and i
[SPEAKER_00]: actually don't know exactly what napro
research is doing there's not much you can
[SPEAKER_00]: read online even if you read the patents
and i've got an invitation out to mark
[SPEAKER_00]: lewis hopefully hopefully he'll come out
on the show but but you know i have to
[SPEAKER_00]: both like on one side i i like the idea of
the genomics being free but at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time i'm i'm really impressed from what
about what i think napros doing where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are they're using technology dedication
efficiency and skill to do a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: non-gmo hybridization process really fast
so they are um you know they they're
[SPEAKER_00]: developing these these strains with
incredible terpenes that then go and win
[SPEAKER_00]: awards and then charge people to use their
strains and i'm so torn right because i i
[SPEAKER_00]: want all this stuff to stay in the in the
public domain but at the same time as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis well i guess i can't call myself
a cannabis breeder as someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in cannabis breeding i can't
help but be impressed that they're pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: this off i mean anybody who does you know
dedication to a particular area and excels
[SPEAKER_00]: at it that's pretty impressive and yet at
the same time i want it in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere it's it's it's hard to think of
about because i you know i i want these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to be able to recoup some of the
you know not some but i want them to make
[SPEAKER_00]: profit you know on all their efforts and
money they put into it but at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time i want it to be available to
everybody that's a that's a that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a sharp edge right there it is and
that gets us back to our the first set of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions which was you know monsanto
spends a billion dollars a year on
[SPEAKER_01]: research right are they supposed to just
give that up to everybody for free how do
[SPEAKER_01]: they recoup that same thing with with
napro right so if if they're using tools
[SPEAKER_01]: like i'm building here marker assisted
breeding rapid cycle generation and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and we could have gone down that path
but i felt it was a bad route for us right
[SPEAKER_01]: who's going to use my genetic analysis
services they think that i'm competing
[SPEAKER_01]: with them to build my own strains right so
so i we chose this steep hill to stay out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that arena okay and just to offer the
services so that we can help other people
[SPEAKER_01]: do it right so napros doing it in house so
i i i and again i did not know about it
[SPEAKER_01]: until the recent spate of of their stuff
that they won and and i looked them up as
[SPEAKER_01]: well after that and you know i mean more
power to them they are doing they are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what monsanto what dao what those
companies do that they build a better
[SPEAKER_01]: mousetrap and then they license it out for
everybody to use right that's that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: business works yeah you really it's
unfortunate right so yeah because because
[SPEAKER_01]: the the problem is is that we in the
industry have not been prepared for
[SPEAKER_01]: business to work that way right we were
caught unawares and now unfortunately the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do it better than us are going
to come in and try to take it from us
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's the sore point and you know
coming up and earning my stripes through
[SPEAKER_00]: you know patient advocacy and working with
you know medical farmers and old heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that's where my heart is right but
at the same time you know i'm a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: former tech business strategist so i see
the brilliance in the licensing as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really torn because i want these
heritage farmers whose lunch is being
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten by all the new green rush folks i
would like them to get paid for for the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that they've done on on cannabis over
all these years you know during
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition and in the you know with the
threat of you know going to jail these
[SPEAKER_00]: people deserve something for all you know
for for keeping the flame alive right and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this important research but
unfortunately um you know i can't want
[SPEAKER_00]: patents for them but but not want patents
for other people it's a it's a way bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: picture than that and that's that gets
confusing and so so when people jump
[SPEAKER_00]: squarely on one side it usually makes me a
little suspicious you know just like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in maugly's um discussion right you
know like like like the fact that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you were approaching the
question from two radically different
[SPEAKER_00]: sides and yet you agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: i think that there's a lot more beyond and
patents doesn't it's like puff puff cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: well yes except if we choose to right so
we can do the puff puff patent and then
[SPEAKER_01]: say okay i now let at so but that real
we're going to say puff puff but puffed
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass to those people we wanted that to use
right so so but and and this gets into all
[SPEAKER_01]: such other stuff I don't want to make this
a natural property, you know discussion,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you can choose to assign the rights
to use that patent anybody want once you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a patent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have to charge them for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let them use for free,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that is is that you by
doing that by letting some people have it
[SPEAKER_01]: for cheaper for free you set the value of
the patent low so that when you turn
[SPEAKER_01]: around and Santa comes knocking on your
door you can't charge them a million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars for something you gave somebody
else for free That's not that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pet in the patent domain that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So So, you know So, you know it is you
know But if you choose to just give it
[SPEAKER_01]: away for free and not charge anybody for
it then you can Give it away for free and
[SPEAKER_01]: not give it away to the people that you
choose not to give it to it's your patent
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do anything you want with it so
changing gears one more time before before
[SPEAKER_00]: we wrap up, you know, a lot of people are
saying like don't worry about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patents because Once they finally
become enforceable with descheduling They
[SPEAKER_00]: will be challenged in court and there's
just no way that they'll stand up in
[SPEAKER_00]: court.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so In my analysis I felt that there
were some weaknesses in the patent I felt
[SPEAKER_01]: that one of the things was is that there
was wasn't enough attention paid to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that these things were all f1 and
therefore they're they're they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: stable and The seeds that were deposited
and ironically that are deposited outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the United States Which means you can't
bring them back in the United States to
[SPEAKER_01]: test them at all because it's illegal But
that's another point so you the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes then you know In it in the
potential I lost my train of thought here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Was asking you how likely was that it
would stand up in court and you said you
[SPEAKER_00]: said well there's a bunch of holes and
Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so some of the holes are you know that
You have Well, this is the concept that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be talking about this this this
Friday with AI PLA is you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a The fact that a particular set
of genetics grown different ways will give
[SPEAKER_01]: you multiple outcomes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a situation in a situation like
that, okay, you have to ask the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then You know what what defines?
[SPEAKER_01]: The output right because none of you know,
they're claiming You know THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the limitation behind that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_01]: behind something that was part of the
genetics and something that was not so In
[SPEAKER_01]: this patent they took some germplasm a lot
of different germplasm They have a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding table of all things that they did
that would and they did it that way so
[SPEAKER_01]: they could peel off a lot of patents but
in every situation right they tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: claim an f1 right and the issue with the
f1 then is heterozygosity the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: examiner actually Made a comment about it
in the prosecution of one of the patents
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there was an examiner interview
and it went away and I'd say that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the the places where I
would hammer the hardest is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so Why is something that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a seed deposit for and I can take
those seeds and I can show you that when I
[SPEAKER_01]: germinate the seeds that are on deposit
You'll get 40 20 40, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: however many phenotypes So which one of
those phenotypes is the correct phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: for this claim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I would go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that there are weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's potential for challenge
I think it's going to be a tough a tough
[SPEAKER_01]: road a hoe only because there's not a lot
of prior art so what has to happen is
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's going to have to go through and
look at all of the hemp fest and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald cups and the high times cups and
all the data that's ever been published
[SPEAKER_01]: like on Facebook and those places because
there is no Scientific data available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no publications Where we can say
look strain X has this chemical profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way to challenge these things
is to show that these things existed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the public domain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So find some of these old 2012 2013 high
times cups all these things that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: published and then take that with that in
hand say, okay So now the genetics is not
[SPEAKER_01]: stable or the genetics are not stable
Okay, they they they say they have seed
[SPEAKER_01]: deposit X but if we take seed deposit X
and we germinate them look at All the
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenotypes so that combination
of things is probably the best way to go
[SPEAKER_01]: after these to invalidate these patents
The problem with that is is that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking a fair amount of money to
get the background data You got to
[SPEAKER_01]: germinate the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do chemical analysis There's a
whole bunch of stuff that will need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: led up to because there's no other way to
do it So this is going to be a long
[SPEAKER_01]: drawn-out expensive patent battle unless
it's done by an inter partes review or an
[SPEAKER_01]: ex partes review so that you can avoid a
court battle so Right on sounds like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of attorneys getting rich off this and a
great area for up-and-comers to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: You know law and biotech side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds like it's going to be a very
exciting Playground for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know before I let you go Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were telling me earlier about The the
new expansion to your lab there at steep
[SPEAKER_00]: hill Why don't you tell me a little bit
about that before before I let you go
[SPEAKER_00]: because you sounded pretty damn excited
about it Yeah, no, I am excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We have steep hills is I mean from the
last time we talked it's not even the same
[SPEAKER_01]: company anymore, dude so we have steeple
global now, which is a a Parrot kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: division that handles our expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were you know, we have steep in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going into Europe We're in we are in
Canada We're you know, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: negotiations going on in South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so steep hill has become an
international company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have steeple global we have steeple
ventures Which is actually an incubator
[SPEAKER_01]: arm now where we actually take startup
cannabis You know tech companies bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them in house help them with finances
help, you know with science to validate
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually split up Steep hill labs
into a production and R&D company now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we actually have a strictly devoted
Production side then their job is to do
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing but to make sure the trains run on
time tests get out in a timely fashion
[SPEAKER_01]: reports are accurate that kind of stuff
and and The generation of all this stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to kind of carve out steep hill R
&D My little area where we continue the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do the kind of collaborative
research with universities We we do some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the validation work and and you know
Incubator work that goes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that we bring in from steeple
ventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So But the the really amazing thing is is
that all the stuff that you and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about over the years was has been
done with basic me Anthony and Christian
[SPEAKER_01]: and at one point we had Bob as well Bob
Givens who's as my laboratory director for
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics but who took a leave of absence
about two years ago because he of some
[SPEAKER_01]: family issues and and Unfortunately,
the family issues just keep getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So So, you know, so all of the work that
steep hill is known for genetically has
[SPEAKER_01]: been done on the back of like three people
really right so But the cool thing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: now steep hill R&D has a its own staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my main Researchers,
I've got a full-time bioinformatics
[SPEAKER_01]: personnel guy now Keith Allen who came to
me from Syngenta So we've actually been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some corporate rating ourselves and
bringing in some really powerful people to
[SPEAKER_01]: help really blow up our R&D and our
bioinformatics and genetics capability The
[SPEAKER_01]: last thing is is that we actually have our
own genomic services division that started
[SPEAKER_01]: up and it's being headed by Daniela
Vergara who is actually the head postdoc
[SPEAKER_01]: and the the postdoc in charge of the
cannabis research At University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Boulder and Nolan Cain's lab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've cemented that that that
partnership even further by hiring her as
[SPEAKER_01]: our director of genomic services So steep
hill has doubled down on the genetic side
[SPEAKER_01]: and and it's just it's really exciting the
stuff that's coming out of on a daily
[SPEAKER_01]: basis from my R&D team is it I mean
literally dude if I could if I could you
[SPEAKER_01]: know use a an appropriate reference it's
like Being a porn addict and then and
[SPEAKER_00]: having unlimited access So essentially the
invention of the internet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I was at a a lunch the other day and
somebody said, oh, yeah steep hill They've
[SPEAKER_00]: put together, you know a world-class
terpene lab like like one of the best in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world You must be feeling pretty proud
to have been able to Finally put together
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pieces that you've been trying to
put together for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely and and Let me tell you
So once we plugged in the data just
[SPEAKER_01]: started rolling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot tell you so So before you know
you I was proud to say oh, yeah we have
[SPEAKER_01]: another couple genes and development for
our you know for our library of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: services and and now it's like I'm like we
have we have to develop how many at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time I have like a list of 40 genes
that we're developing all at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: now because that's how fast you're coming
out of the bioinformatics pipeline right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, so Oh my god, well right on well,
congratulations on all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm and I'm like candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally Well, I'm sure you'll hit on a
couple other topics that will that uh that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have you back on the show for but
more than anything, dude Thank you so much
[SPEAKER_00]: for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's really valuable and in nobody
really tells the story like you do You've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the science and the law background,
but also the swagger to tell it how it is
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you coming on the show and
breaking it down Thanks, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're the only person who appreciates
the fact that I'm an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you You got to go with your
strengths, man You can connect with Reggie
