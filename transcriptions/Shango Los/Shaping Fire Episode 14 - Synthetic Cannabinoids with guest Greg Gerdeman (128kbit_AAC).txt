[SPEAKER_00]: I vaguely remember when I started hearing
about fake marijuana on local news
[SPEAKER_00]: stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sold under the brand names like Spice
and K2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pay much attention because,
you know, come on, fake marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fake marijuana is oregano that some rookie
accidentally buys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one time I came across it and they
didn't refer to it as fake marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they called it synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was then that they had my total
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fake marijuana is a stupid name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic cannabinoids is specific enough
and shows enough understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that I decided it was worth
searching online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be darned, people were actually
making synthetic cannabinoids in a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory and selling it on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks were getting fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks were having outlandish side effects
like blurred vision, vomiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, hallucinations, heart attacks,
and some folks even died.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy thing is that calling it fake
marijuana is just totally untrue and
[SPEAKER_00]: really lazy journalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody made cannabinoids in a lab that
do not even occur in the marijuana plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are totally not of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may technically be in the same
chemical class as what is in a real plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sativa, but they really have zero
in common in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, synthetic cannabinoids,
why they exist, and how they made it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the laboratory and for sale at your
local gas station is a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: story.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Dr. Greg Gerdeman,
and today we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg is a neurophysiologist with expertise
in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has received research support from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse and the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Science Foundation, and his
articles have appeared in journals such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature Neuroscience, Trends in
Neuroscience, and Neuropsychopharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: His ongoing research, while an assistant
professor of biology at Eckerd College,
[SPEAKER_00]: includes the molecular physiology of
cannabinoid receptors and their
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary evolution within neural
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you could be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, before we get into synthetic
cannabinoids, let's review what actually
[SPEAKER_00]: are naturally occurring cannabinoids so
that people can see the contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to be easy for your
audience to realize that the naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring cannabinoids, as their name
applies, are those that are naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesized from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about cannabinoids,
I'm thinking about that family of
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules that are made by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know that there's more and more
interest in other natural products that
[SPEAKER_01]: have some interaction with the cannabinoid
system, like, say, beta-karyophylline is a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural product in black peppers and in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I think of cannabinoids,
I'm thinking of THC, CBD, varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: thereof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the real, the most popular ones,
things that come from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, some people talk about
endocannabinoids, you know, the endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that are produced inside the
human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other folks are talking about
phytocannabinoids that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto, meaning coming from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are synthetic cannabinoids neither of
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they are a third thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, I think of them as a third
thing, and I like those distinctions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the endocannabinoids are as
natural as can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where I've spent my time
mostly thinking about and are found all
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants have molecules that we now
see as endocannabinoids, like anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phyto cannabinoids come from the plants,
and mostly I'm thinking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One could use synthetic chemistry to make
a cannabinoid, like THC can be made
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetically, you know, and it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be a synthetic or
semi-synthetic cannabinoid, in my view.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just mimicking a natural
cannabinoid, it may be gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what we call synthetic
cannabinoids are chemical, structural
[SPEAKER_01]: analogs that are based on either the phyto
cannabinoids or the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but tweaked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a different atom here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a proprietary nucleus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look to see if it can act in the body
a little differently, a little stronger,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little longer, less psychoactive,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when K2 and Spice came out
and people started talking about them as
[SPEAKER_00]: being, you know, fake pot or synthetic
cannabinoids, I remember, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who's a cannabis enthusiast was
just, you know... Makes you pull your hair
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, why on earth would you do
something so evil with something so
[SPEAKER_00]: natural and beautiful?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as I got into this,
doing my research, you know, for the show
[SPEAKER_00]: today, I actually realized that the
synthetic cannabinoids were made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for the good of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go ahead and tell us that story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, what we call
synthetics, I mean, they came out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research endeavor, the research
environment, because people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand sort of the narrative of
discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not get that, but honestly,
I mean, when we celebrate the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, the receptors and
the ligands, the endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, in some way, we really owe
that to synthetic drug tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Case in point, I mean, some of the potent
THC analogs were synthesized and created
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just chemical structural
analogs of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pharmacologists, we didn't know what
the CB1, CB2 receptors were, but they knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that this drug looked like THC,
it was made to look like THC, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: much more strong, much stronger than THC
in like how it affected rodent behavior,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some chemists stuck a little
radioactive probe on it, made it high hot
[SPEAKER_01]: ligand or what we call a radioisotope,
that's a weakly radioactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those synthetic cannabinoids became
probes that were used to probe around
[SPEAKER_01]: brain tissue in experimental animals and
discover that, in fact, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how the receptor was initially
discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a binding site for these synthetic
THC analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as the receptor was discovered,
the endocannabinoids were discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst the, and I was just getting into
the field at that point and at a young
[SPEAKER_01]: age, and there was so much excitement
amongst the small field of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers, but those cannabinoid
researchers who were chemists were
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to tweak the molecules and try
to come up with analogs of an anamide or
[SPEAKER_01]: THC that could be more specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe a more useful therapeutic or just
used as a research tool to figure out,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, is CB1 doing this or is CB2 doing
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it responsible for something that's
seen in the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know unless you can
specifically activate or block them with
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as, a lot of people don't,
I mean, I didn't even know when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: got into this, the idea of it as a lab
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you kind of explain a little bit
how building a lab tool to be used in
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments is helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes you need to run a test
that the molecule you need doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, in a general sense,
you said it quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the brain is so complicated,
the pharmacology of our bodies are so
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated that trying to get specificity
of a drug that hits certain targets and
[SPEAKER_01]: not others is not something that you
necessarily have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not something you have in the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those molecules are actually, the
phytocannabinoids are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: delightfully wide acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets a bad rap historically to
say it's a dirty drug because THC will hit
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to find out, I think that's a big
part of why it's a surprisingly gentle
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of medicine that you have this
entourage of molecules that hit so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I digress a little bit with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a tool to try and figure out
the fine nuts and bolts of how this unseen
[SPEAKER_01]: world of molecules in our mind work,
you have to develop specific compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that really target them or in the world of
genetics, tinker with an animal so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has slightly different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying all of this is necessary to
come up with the best medicine as part of
[SPEAKER_01]: where the disconnect is, but it is
necessary for this quest to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize that, Dr. Huffman and
others in those early days, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: developing these synthetic cannabinoids
not because they ever intended them to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a product, but because they,
for example, wanted to take a receptor and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, okay, well, natural cannabinoids can
highlight this receptor up to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would it take to open up all the
way to a 100% or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those didn't exist in nature,
but they wanted to see what it would take
[SPEAKER_00]: to open it up all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they made fake ones, synthetic
ones, to see what it would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe after the fact,
they would try to find something in nature
[SPEAKER_00]: that acted the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, they're kind of like
crutches to move the research on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which aren't really ever supposed to get
out of the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in a way, I see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, developing a tool, like I made
that example without much forethought,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how the tools were used as probes to
find the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: To work experimentally, it's going to be a
better molecule as a probe if it binds
[SPEAKER_01]: more tightly than THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And though binding tightly isn't
synonymous with being a more powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: potent drug, it tends to track that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these super powerful activators that
are like a thousand times more potent than
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, they were developed as a tool to be
strong binding ligands drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, when you say that the drugs
were never meant to be out of the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like these medicinal
chemists aren't open to it becoming a
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when they synthesize a series of
things, John Huffman at Clemson developed
[SPEAKER_01]: that JWH series of drugs that is his
initials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other like real eminent
chemists who have done stuff, including
[SPEAKER_01]: Raphael Mishulam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the series of drugs called HU,
HU210 is one I've used experimentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very strong THC analog,
and it has appeared in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit spice products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as many as the JWH series because
they're easy to synthesize by the
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine chemists who whip them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, here's the thing,
scientists aren't, so they may have been
[SPEAKER_01]: open to the idea that this could be a
therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course they would patent it and
spin it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, not outside their
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when they go to scientific
conferences and say, here's this drug and
[SPEAKER_01]: it works to target this population of
receptors and not this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our animal model, it shows,
hey, it might be useful for diabetes or
[SPEAKER_01]: something in a way that won't make you
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are trying to, scientists,
chemists trying to contribute to their
[SPEAKER_01]: view of the greater good and developing
therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process of giving scientific
talks and publishing papers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they show what the molecule is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone with a decent organic
chemistry background can look at molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: like the JWH series.
[SPEAKER_01]: That look a lot like an arachidonic acid
and an anamide, things that are very easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to obtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can make it in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you open these things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of parallels with the
other, you know, serotonin reuptake
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of drugs that were developed
as research tools got out into a club
[SPEAKER_01]: scene and some of them have led to fatal
overdoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk more about their
uses by recreational drug users after
[SPEAKER_00]: their first break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we go to commercial,
I wanted to ask you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first got into researching
synthetics, I kind of thought that people
[SPEAKER_00]: were developing the synthetic cannabinoids
because using real cannabis was so
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted in research by the federal
government that they had to create other
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard this from other people,
but now hearing you talk about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like synthetic cannabinoids
would be useful as tools in the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory, regardless if the research
scientists had access to real whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you said, I mean, I wouldn't be
surprised if that has entered into the
[SPEAKER_01]: equation either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there, you know, when a lot of
these drugs were developed, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: already hundreds of labs interested or at
least dozens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabinoids, there are now thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, developing something
that could get around the DEA scheduling
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so proprietary would have
been an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the synthetics, I mean,
I remember very well when the HU compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly got moved to schedule one and it
put a huge burden on people who were using
[SPEAKER_01]: it for their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go ahead and take our first
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is cannabinoid
researcher Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terps before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terps you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com board slash true
terpenes to find out more, or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is cannabinoid
researcher, Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
the development of synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and their beneficial original uses that
they were being used for in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, right towards the end,
we were talking about how they got out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the open and they started being
produced by folks who were more interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in using them as an illicit or at the very
least recreational drug for just drug
[SPEAKER_00]: users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of explain, Greg,
how that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this information that's being
used in the lab get into the possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who sees an opportunity to make
money as a street drug with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can speak in general ways to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not privy to the route with
which really any of these escape from the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab in specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, people publish their
science and discuss it at conferences in
[SPEAKER_01]: open ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone who is a savvy organic chemist
can look at structures, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a publication they found that
talks about the synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that some of these drugs,
whether they're in the first papers that
[SPEAKER_01]: used them or in patent filings,
describe the synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you need is some glassware and
burners and knowledge about how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it if you've got that
chemistry background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting too, because,
you know, there are to a certain degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how to guides in the appendix,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of these papers,
you know, they give you the data and the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and explanation in the main body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, there's a treasure trove of good
stuff in the appendix.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these papers that really give you
give you secrets of how to make it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: own lab at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the right apparatus,
if you some of them require certain
[SPEAKER_01]: precursor molecules that are not just
something you go get at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, those compounds
that are easy to synthesize and are so
[SPEAKER_01]: potent, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of these synthetics,
again, are a thousand or ten thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: times more active at CV1 receptors than
THC is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you think about testing
cannabis or something with kefir to
[SPEAKER_01]: elevate the THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people use various, whatever cheap
dried herbs and just spritz a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of these super potent cannabinoids on now
and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's enough that at least sometimes
it's going to cause a powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm sure that there's some
people who are like, wow, thousand times
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get me some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to research,
you know, phyto cannabinoids, you find
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're all kind of they've all got a
breaking system inside of them so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't act open-endedly on your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you explain a little bit why,
you know, using synthetics is so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous than using a naturally occurring
phyto cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I think the way to talk
about it is breaking down how drugs work
[SPEAKER_01]: under two different terms that are very
different to a pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is potency and the other is efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: People wouldn't know the difference when
you're talking about a drugs about drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: if they hadn't studied it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But potency means, you know, the
concentration of a drug how much do you
[SPEAKER_01]: need in order to elicit its maximal effect
or like half maximal effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use that term potency very
generally like, oh, there's more THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: pot so it's more potent now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to a pharmacologist potency means the
potency of THC is the potency of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have more, then you just have a
higher concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're pushing the effect higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But THC in potency in different cells and
tissues of your body or any molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just take THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has, because that's the problem child
of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: THC will still only activate and turn on
that receptor to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maxes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the property of the THC
receptor relationship that's referred to
[SPEAKER_01]: as efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what protects all of us
cannabis users from having a bad day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's been zero deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a safe herb to use is
because of this cap, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: that nature intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the phytocannabinoids certainly have
a certain limited, they're considered
[SPEAKER_01]: partial efficacy agonists or just partial
agonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, THC has its own sort of limiting
step, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't know that honestly until all
these synthetics were made for the various
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons we talked about before the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly you have a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought THC was turning the system on,
but you wash on this CP compound and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a thousand times, it's active at a
thousand times smaller dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it drives the system stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it's not going to have a
thousand times the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a thousand times the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do know, and this is still
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning more about these different
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They not only push the receptor system to
a higher level than anything the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: will do, especially if it's within an
entourage of molecules like CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll help temper THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you've got straight THC and a
lot of it, you know, like some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: straight THC dab or something,
taking a synthetic that has a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy or a higher intrinsic activity,
we also say, will do more than that high
[SPEAKER_01]: level of THC because it pushes the
receptor further.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a molecular property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll plug a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote something about this that was over
on project CBD's website recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should, everyone should know about
project CBD.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it a great repository for,
for research, like Greg is referring to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also they've got a great section on
the website where you can go and click on
[SPEAKER_00]: the word conditions and it goes,
down, I don't know, maybe 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that you may have as a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you easy links to the Western
science that's been done about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and that, and that condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're both big fans of project CBD.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've helped, I've helped to kind of
curate those lists over time and I advise
[SPEAKER_01]: with them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for that work because I use
them with patients all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what is the experience that a user,
an end user would have experiencing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these synthetics that have got,
you know, so much increased potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one thing is that it'll
knock you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for one thing, I mean, it's,
there's absolutely, if people think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tough to know what's in your cannabis,
I mean, these products that are sold as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, spice products, there may be
nothing in there, but, but you may get
[SPEAKER_01]: some super potent agonist and you know,
for example, several of us in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: know someone who was an early used
synthesizer of this or tester of one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these drugs and, and tried some on himself
and was like literally unable to move for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't drop this person's name,
but it was terrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you talk about someone compare
that to the worst, you know, brownie over
[SPEAKER_01]: ingestion that you possibly can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curiously, it is somewhat similar to what
happens in rodents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can give THC at such high
levels to a rat that he's unable to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a cataleptic response.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can like lift up the animal's legs and
stuff, and he just can't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what these, and THC doesn't do that
to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can be totally out there from
a super high dose, but it doesn't make you
[SPEAKER_01]: unable to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these super potent agonists,
I believe can.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, I think the more alarming a
thing is that cannabinoids do have
[SPEAKER_01]: cardiovascular effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect your heart rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect the dilation of your blood
vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoids are used to help
maintain an optimal balance with blood
[SPEAKER_01]: flow and cardiovascular tone like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phytocannabinoids do influence these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence, you know, you can have sort of a
postural drop in blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke a bowl and get a high THC
that lowers your blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can make you need to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC elicits a transient increase in heart
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The synthetics do so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those increases in heart rate,
those quick dynamic changes in blood flow
[SPEAKER_01]: very possibly are increasing the risk for
suffering a cardiovascular incident like a
[SPEAKER_01]: stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's literature to suggest that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, I've talked to multiple
neurologists who they haven't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, done a controlled study,
but they're convinced it's real because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've seen people who've taken these
synthetics and are suffering significant
[SPEAKER_01]: strokes at ages where it's not common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has been used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used to malign cannabis as well
because that literature will pop up and
[SPEAKER_01]: people from like, whatever, Project Sam or
something will say, oh, yeah, we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis increases the risk of stroke,
but they're citing papers that are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at synthetic cannabinoid that is not just
fake THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a super potent, full agonist instead
of a partial agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does things to your receptor system,
drives it more powerfully, causes it to
[SPEAKER_01]: activate cells in ways that THC doesn't
even at heroic doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't, I couldn't tell you all the
reasons why these synthetics are likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just named a couple of them,
but there may be others and it won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: known unless it's really studied
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, people should pursue
a more natural alternative that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: safe for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's really the end point
as far as the end consumer of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, well, we recognize that
you're using Spice or K2 or any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these marketed products because it's
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy it at the local bodega or
parties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe where you live, cannabis is hard
to get, but just because it's synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, it doesn't mean that you're
gonna have an experience that's in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: like safe, natural marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been used interaction with humans
for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more like some crazy Frankenstein
version of it with none of the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: safeguards that come with using whole
plant cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's natural safeguards and
there's the safeguards of people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create a medicine as opposed to
just trying to make a buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go ahead and take our second
short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back, we're gonna talk about
a potential for synthetic cannabinoids be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher, Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who is paying attention to
cannabis medicine, it has become
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly apparent that full extract
cannabis oil, known to some as Rick
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson oil, is the cornerstone of healing
humans with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a medical dispensary or retail
store, you know that your customers are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have been working with patients
and seeking out quality full extract oil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Pacific Northwest, you know the
provider, Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kat Jeter and her team at Deep Green have
been making full extract cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the standards for quality and
exact dosing for years in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Deep Green brand is known by patients
and cannabis media as a premium quality
[SPEAKER_00]: provider for sick children, cancer
patients, and others in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a time when there are no national
standards for cannabis oil, ensuring a
[SPEAKER_00]: product is whole plant, quality assured,
and lab tested is often a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing your source is reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust in a quality brand is essential when
choosing a cannabis medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used concentrated and in volume by
any patient, and especially those with
[SPEAKER_00]: weakened immune systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Green is looking for national brand
partners to expand the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: their legacy top shelf cannabis oil to
emerging medical and licensed states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partners benefit from the Deep Green brand
recognition and credibility, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing customer and marketing support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but Deep Green knows how to
employ the 280E tax rule so you can deduct
[SPEAKER_00]: it all from your taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with Deep Green can provide the
trust and authenticity too often pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: aside in favor of lifestyle products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your customers can assure themselves that
regardless of the state in which it is
[SPEAKER_00]: made, brand licensees adhere to the same
strict standards that patients everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: have come to expect from Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Green licensing includes startup and
capital planning, as well as operational
[SPEAKER_00]: and manufacturing instruction as you'd
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information on how your company,
co-op, or medical dispensary can benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from partnering with Deep Green to provide
full extract cannabis oil to patients,

Green to connect with Kat Jeter and her
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shapingfire.com forward slash Deep
Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guest this week is cannabinoid
researcher, Dr. Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, we trashed synthetic cannabinoids
pretty hardcore in the last set,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we know that they came out of a lab
where they were trying to do good
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a future in pharmaceuticals for
synthetic cannabinoids to be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's positive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that it certainly could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 20 years now, I've been researching in
this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many grant proposals
or paper discussion taglines have played
[SPEAKER_01]: the language that we could develop more
specific drugs or that have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, specifically that don't have the
kind of psychoactivity that cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as we learn more about the
endocannabinoid system being everywhere in
[SPEAKER_01]: the body, I read a paper the other day by
some big research team, not a usual
[SPEAKER_01]: suspect cannabinoid team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so many people are into
cannabinoids, and they said very
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward in their paper,
the endocannabinoid system is now seen as
[SPEAKER_01]: a master, as the, they use the word the
master regulator of physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of thing, if I'd have said it in
1999, I'd have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: laughed out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so we know the importance of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's robust, it's diverse, and there are
many different targets, and some
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics may be developed that have
better delivery, better longer lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, something of those nature,
that nature that makes it very usable by
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians and could target specific
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe there's a subset of
mitochondrial disease that, as we learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more, that certain synthetics like target
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other hand, maybe some of the
minority cannabinoids that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: terribly understudied might treat those
populations as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's promise in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, synthetic cannabinoids
can be used in researching, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: full plant natural cannabinoids too,
because, you know, they're just,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're being used in the experiments as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe synthetic cannabinoids can still
be used, maybe, maybe not as
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical products, but they
certainly seem to have uses in the lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting your experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure, for sure they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drugs that block receptors are very
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tools, drugs that have different little
labels on them that you can see them on
[SPEAKER_01]: brain scans have tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what funds and drives brain
research is the promise of discovering
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and cures for brain disease,
primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm a total science geek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about our drive to understand how
it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But primarily, research is funded to find
new tools and, I mean, new treatments and
[SPEAKER_01]: cures even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some synthetic tools could be useful for
that, even if the end result is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I should back up, some synthetic
tools will be useful for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: are useful for that, even if we should be
able to step back from the end result and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, maybe the best answer therapeutically
is something that's been here all along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love that segue too, because the
next point I wanted to make is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as much as you are positing the
possibility of synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: being useful for future patients from the
pharmaceutical industry, I know you to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole plant guy like I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if there's X amount of
money available for cannabinoid research,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing that you're going to say put
all that money into naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant medicine and set aside the
synthetic cannabinoids until we've done a
[SPEAKER_00]: hell of a lot more research on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with apologies to all of the
classical pharmacologists who have trained
[SPEAKER_01]: me and worked with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do think, I also, I don't think
it's a total zero sum game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, within certain institutes,
there will be certain budgets for
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly if the constraints for research
weren't there, funding would come in to
[SPEAKER_01]: support whole plant cannabis therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are enough really good minds
that are fascinated by this, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the most fascinating subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just, I'm amazed by how many
bright thinkers want to study cannabis if
[SPEAKER_01]: they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the constraints to studying it
weren't there, you know, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where a lot of the money would go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is of concern to the sort of
traditional pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, where they're trying to adapt to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took your question a little bit of a
twist, but yeah, I mean, there is the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the kind of thing that Ms.
Shulam has been saying like a profit for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course he's such a real mentor to
so many of us that this plant is a
[SPEAKER_01]: treasure trove and it's just one of the
hugest discoveries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we shouldn't be attached to the fact
that it was discovered a long time ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: rediscovered and rediscovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we now have the state of technology to
dig deeper and do the kind of studies to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how these different molecules
work and how different preparations work
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they work to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was, I was talking to a group
two weeks ago and somebody asked a
[SPEAKER_00]: question during Q&A about synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I was just getting
ready for my, for my talk with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I wasn't too deep on it,
but I said, you know, what I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: about synthetic cannabinoids so far is
it's as if you were going to judge
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself on your worst cousin,
you know, your cousin that comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: party and is disruptive and gets drunk
and, you know, hits on your sister-in-law
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't judge, you know, you and your
whole family based on that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And synthetic cannabinoids kind of seems
to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't judge the cannabis plant and all
of the healing possibility that it holds
[SPEAKER_00]: just because synthetic cannabinoids found
their way out of the lab and are being
[SPEAKER_00]: sold to people who are using it wrong at
street level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's funny because it's
like, it's like THC has been the bad uncle
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot, at least according to the,
the propagandists, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to an extent, the, the, the black
market illegality created the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a selection for high THC plants,
many of which are feeble little things
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't really grow very well,
but they create a lot of THC and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the THC has gotten a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of simply getting you high at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that molecules like CBD and
THCV, just to name a couple, have
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous therapeutic value and they've
been short shifted because of relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: to THC and now exposing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when I see a local news story about
fake pot, it's because the media just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know enough at all, or don't care to
know that it's not fake pot at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a chemical that has never been found
in cannabis ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, kind of like saying
crystal meth is fake dopamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have biological
interactions, but they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, they're not a mimic of one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a bad act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, we come full circle around
to holding up the whole plant and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the safeties that, that nature has
imbued it with as being our primary
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and not something that's
necessarily coming out of the lab today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Greg, thanks for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had been curious about this
for actually, actually that's not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I was curious about
this for a long time, but most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: spice and K2 has just been something I
ignored because it had nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: working with patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just some crazy stuff I'd see on
local news sometimes, but then when the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time I heard them say, you know,
synthetic cannabinoids, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, my whole life is cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should learn about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I understand now better
that it's, it's, you know, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have anything to do with marijuana
except for how the news reports about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel far more confident in discussing it
with people and, and that I know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for sharing your
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, it does act on a
similar pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different and it is important
because, you know, we, like in Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, we're dealing with situations
where the industry is getting started in
[SPEAKER_01]: what I will delicately say is a very
clumsy way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, you know, medicines are starting
to roll out under the state legal system
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're, they're absurdly expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not transparently tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's easy to imagine
scenarios where the dialogue around
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis being medicine is much more
common and somebody in a different,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a, in some community somewhere gets
ripped off by saying, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to pay that through the,
you know, through the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff is like cannabis only.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use, you know,
so if this dialogue can help to inform
[SPEAKER_01]: better that people don't make those
mistakes and could lead to a serious
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, then it's, it's important to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
