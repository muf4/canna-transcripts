[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there friends, Shango here from
Shaping Fire and I'm here with Dan Jimmy
[SPEAKER_01]: of Gnome Automatics and we're neighbors,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives just over the water from me in
Port Orchard and so I'm over here pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly like fishing or crabbing or just
looking at our gardens and I'm over here
[SPEAKER_01]: today and Dan is showing me the present
state of his garden and I'm all like,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to show me all of this
incredible garden, let's go ahead and take
[SPEAKER_01]: some photos and get some, you know,
share it with everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's all like, yeah, all right,
let's set up some chairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks Dan for giving us a couple
minutes to like look at your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just glad your excitement brought us
to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm excited about it this year
and it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's way better than what I had last
year and we could talk about that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually we thought about doing this
video last year and then we just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned it and didn't get to it,
but I'm glad now we waited till this year
[SPEAKER_01]: because this year's garden is so much
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan, what I'm thinking is let's talk a
little bit about the cannabis stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing and then we'll talk a
little bit about the food stuff since you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, this is your home garden and so
you're providing food for your family too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, like you, your main thing
is breeding auto flowers and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're nationally known for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been selling seeds for years,
but what's behind us here is some new
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that you're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you tell us about that first
and as you show them, I'll show some
[SPEAKER_01]: closeups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So behind us, what you're seeing is the
actual 304 project that's come to a close
[SPEAKER_00]: for this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say come to a close, you know,
we're working on it and I'm super thrilled
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you said, nationally known
and I've gotten, you've been selling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been some good ones that have
come out, but there hasn't been anything
[SPEAKER_00]: as excited as I am for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several attributes I've been
hunting for the last few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I've been trying to improve
from feedback from people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my turp game was weak, but I think
that we've turned that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ran your nose through here a little
bit earlier and I think things have
[SPEAKER_00]: shifted on that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's huge gas too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like getting gas in an auto flower is
hard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real hard and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be even stranger in auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to go away quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just tend to lose it when it
comes close to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how they come out and how
they dry and see what's left after that
[SPEAKER_00]: process as far as the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I'm super thrilled about
is what we've seen in testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with field grown autos and
farms, is a lot of time cover crop can
[SPEAKER_00]: out-compete the auto growth, whether it be
from weather stress or anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping them small or even in that infancy
stage where they're waiting to take root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the cover crop will out-compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had that problem myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is growing, but the cover crop
is passing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it chokes it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has become, I don't want to say a
big roadblock, but a common roadblock that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last couple of years with farmers
and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been looking for a cultivar
that can do two things for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplant stability, as we all know,
autos, they can be transplanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to be diligent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a timing window and it can be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was looking for something that can
take a little bit of longer window in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller container and still end up like
what's behind us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 10 foot centers in here and majority
of these are six foot or taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the smallest one in here was six
foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the biggest auto flowers that
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after this year, I've grown like 180
some auto flower varieties that I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen anything this chunky or tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and these are the first ones that
I've had come out consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently across a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started 175 of these this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 made it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that 150, it got thinned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most males were removed except for one,
two males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two females were then reversed
for a little bit of just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: play and something new, just trying to
kind of keep some diversity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to see what happens, I want to
see what ratios happen if we get an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase of female just to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 304 is already in the market
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the new generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this are these F3s or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are F3s that are currently
available in the market as reg only.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are making the F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selections were done from what I
called the pink selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the end of last summer, which were
pink flowers as well as pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a private selection working for
the F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the larger of the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were late season last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were specifically ran to look for the
mold mildew as well as their rapidness to
[SPEAKER_00]: growth to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are over 90 days now, I think,
because they were started at June 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely beyond 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not growing for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense that you would be
growing more than 90 days so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could get really nice finished zebra
striped seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you beat me to the punch there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely say these are easily
takeable between 70 and 80 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's six and seven and eight foot
from germination to finish to this size
[SPEAKER_00]: behind us 70 to 80 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure that anybody who is familiar
with auto flowers and is seeing this is
[SPEAKER_01]: all like, how are these so chunky and big?
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly we all know the importance
of having good genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it's auto flowers or
photos or tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good genetics are super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So setting that aside for a minute,
what the hell else are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everything around here is so huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that people are going to be
like, what the hell else is he using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not an A plus B kind of
chemical guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not force feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing in here is force fed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that is sitting around us is
100% fed through the line only on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do incorporate compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm casting teas are my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives me an opportunity here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready to do a little work with
Luna and we're going to put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a collaboration together
and we'll go over the kind of compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to set up one that
she uses and recommendations and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, stay tuned for that
more on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rest of it behind us, all the
autos are in a seven year hugel bed that's
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped and dropped every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dry amendments are added throughout,
you know, the winter months, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: mulched back over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cover crops and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so pretty much it's, it's a
pre-fortified substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't feed them during the season,
but you keep the microbes vibrant by,
[SPEAKER_01]: by reinforcing them with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biggest thing for me
overwintering, I've tried multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different things in here as far as like
mulching layers overwintering to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that layer alive on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straw does good, but you have to deal with
a lot of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose some root mass when
you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it can come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I have found that I am lucky is I
have a friend who is a woodworker and he
[SPEAKER_00]: turns tables and bowls and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gives me these giant contractor
bags of nothing but hardwood shavings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real thin shavings and you can see it
behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has become the perfect mulching
layer to keep that top surface moist and
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes alive all the way to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to have the roots go take full
advantage of the area that they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's important about
using this type of, oh yeah, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this type of what did you call these
shavings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, shavings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leighton Morrison taught me something
really important about these because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people are concerned about using wood
chips on top because the biological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes they go through can actually
suck nitrogen out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these, when you get them from someone
who turns wood, these are all pre cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're denatured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they take a lot longer time to
break down and they break down in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different way, which means that they're
not stealing the nitrogen from your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those two and I swear by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get your hands on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm fortunate enough to get
those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, he pesters me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got like six of these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gotten it down to a rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he usually hits me up in the spring
and in the fall or in the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when the crops come down,
but he knows I'm out here mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get your hands on it,
you know, somebody use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the 304 auto flowers behind
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dan, doesn't you really, as far as I'm
aware of, breed photo periods all that
[SPEAKER_01]: much anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I only use them for new sources of
genetics to make, you know, to bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these photo, these photo periods,
this is all your head stash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly the auto flowers are well ahead
of the photo periods, which I'll tuck in
[SPEAKER_01]: some photos here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell us, about, you know,
plug the people who you respect that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing their photo periods this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've got like most growers
and most people in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: have a freezer full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some stuff that I collected from
years of people who I looked up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as I have watched their breeding
practices and stuff for over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I didn't want some of these
seeds to go to the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked a couple of them that just,
you know, it weren't newer and some that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had from years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell foundation from California and then
dead panhead from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've come to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got some of their cultivars out
here this year and I was looking to go old
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like, there's a lot of indica
influence out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG three, white gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's triangle Kush and tendon and the
platinum pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice little mix and some stuff to play
with to bring in new, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics into the auto world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get both the head stash and then the
auto males and the pollen donors are gone
[SPEAKER_00]: way before it becomes a danger to the
photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, some of the pre flowers got
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just enough for me to take a
look at the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the photo period comes out something I
like, which I got to give credit to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the TKM 10 cross the platinum pie
for my tall for my tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is way ahead of the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two side by side, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure he'll have pictures for you
guys to see here later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that they they look nothing
alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason you know they're from the
same group of seeds is because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they want to stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to I would say, what would you
maybe two weeks left on that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, unnatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I was looking for out of one,
two, four, six.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however many are in the row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And living here in the Pacific Northwest,
we're always looking for anything that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes my life easy as an auto
breeder, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about your auto flower
this year, the 304 and your photo periods
[SPEAKER_01]: for your head stash and photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explanation or exploration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this frickin tomato plant
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that these are just two tomato
plants because I brought them to you from
[SPEAKER_01]: Vashon Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the hell did this monstrosity happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: That monstrosity is a direct result of an
above ground hugel bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically like the same thing that's
buried behind us, but in a hundred gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: country line farm tank drill the bottom
out logs, layers and leaf mulch and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, have you been taking fruit off
of it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, we've had fruit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gotten too shaded now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of slowed down on the fruit
production, but everything's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally ripen up, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pounds of tomatoes up inside
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really took off this year in its
same treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, worm castings, tea and some
foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that's looking good,
even though it's in your first year,
[SPEAKER_01]: is your strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when you sent me the picture of
the box that you had made and you were all
[SPEAKER_01]: like baked and is late and you were all
like, like, look what I made, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it looks like we're at the end of
your strawberry season, but it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, as you can see,
you know, behind you there or in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: you here, we've got the three pots that
the donors came from, but they did turn
[SPEAKER_00]: around really well and started producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect by next next summer, it'll be
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a midsummer thing trying to
get these thinned out and trying to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get my corn slash berry patch going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of another, you know, new area to
play in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the berries, like since it's their
first year, it's not all grown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got gaps so they can expand and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by next year, it'll be all full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that'll be crazy back in there with
berries next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be really nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not a lot of people grow corn in
the Pacific Northwest where we live
[SPEAKER_01]: because the summer like this summer is
hella short and it doesn't get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know last year you grew corn and all
you grew was a bunch of swearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then this year you've been given corn
to like all your neighbors and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so a like, you know, why did you
decide to bother with corn in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest when it was probably going to be
a fail?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what did you do different this
year versus last year that you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting like buttloads of corn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the corn thing is a nostalgia for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather used to grow yards and
yards and yards of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always grew yards of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great summertime treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boy absolutely just smashes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the area of the old
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that soil was worked initially because
it was sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing in ground back then,
you know, new experimentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I don't want to really
waste this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing really going on here as a
corn would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first year with all the swearing
was learning my phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I bought several different
varieties from the local ace hardware and
[SPEAKER_00]: one out of the group produced a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest were nothing but ornamental for
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, however, one of the things that
impacted me last year, too, was crowding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got too excited and didn't send enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, the cultivar that did
produce the couple of years we had last
[SPEAKER_00]: year produced in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I could give you the name,
but I can't remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did find it in ace hardware and it's
a 65 day cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our shit weather, I applied the
same knowledge to other flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has a short flowering period,
maybe we'll actually get something and it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually heirloom this year was
saved from the corn from last year that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made it since I didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I could save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it did great this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saved a few more years and I'm just
going to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I showed up and after I said all
my like, holy crap comments because this
[SPEAKER_01]: garden is so it's so much larger than last
year, not like number of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but each plant is so much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the same things, especially since
we're friends and I get your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your stuff is so much bigger than it's
ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a road nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that you do is you
run lines to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm a big fan of hand
watering so that I can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust the water for different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to tell you, I'm getting closer
and closer to the idea of installing water
[SPEAKER_01]: lines because this just shows the magic of
consistent small amounts of watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I water the plant is the,
the, the pot is all super wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets all hella dry and then it
gets super wet and then it gets dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, you know, it would probably
be better if I was doing a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, you know, because I'm working
too, I tend to do like every other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of makes the, the,
the case even more that I should have some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of drip irrigation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we just take a second and
just like plug drip irrigation as a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a theme, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just plain and simple with the wood mulch
and the consistent watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are bigger than they ever have
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saving water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other big thing that I think
people are missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm literally saving water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines don't run all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I come out here to look when I do
the compost teas, obviously I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I can see if the top layer is
starting to dry back, but it doesn't dry
[SPEAKER_00]: back because I have everything on timers,
everything comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want good, consistent yields
with healthy plants across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the hoogle bed has spray
heads that consistent top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it comes back to what I said
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots can use that top fraction
of that soil, that's a fraction area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to pull more food from,
if you can protect it and keep that alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why you're seeing what
we're seeing here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had a really, just like put all
that, this is what you're seeing is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a direct result of what I'm
saying right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that consistent watering and a mulch
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I want to finish up with
is just, you know, I have seen your
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens now many years in a row and every
year they get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you learned from this year that
you already know that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate next year as something new
learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something new learned definitely needs
some more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got fans all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not enough, eh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's microclimates in here still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll see tiny little pockets of PM
where I don't see it anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that frustrates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't like, I know it's like
unavoidable to keep it outside of and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you know, we're not going to live in
a powdery mildew free zone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ignorant to think about, but I've got
a pretty good grip on where the
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates are in here, but I still
wouldn't like to improve airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think would be the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to switch some of the
irrigation heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, like we were talking about earlier,
when we moved these pots, the drip
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation had the laser cut holes in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can layer them all the way down and it
keeps that moisture even throughout that
[SPEAKER_00]: pot low and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they always have that source of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something I'm definitely
going to improve because I kind of hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look down through here and maybe
you can grab some shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see some that have heads in the top,
some that I've come back through and
[SPEAKER_00]: retrofitted with the actual buried lines
and the buried lines plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, I think they're more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm looking down through here,
to be honest, I got to agree too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, one thing that I learned
from last year that I want incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: this year that was a success, I think is
important to talk about was being,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, prophylactic with my mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very bad mite issue last year for
some reason this side of this where I'm at
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two-spot loves to thrive and got in
early with Californicus and stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent monthly with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really kicked her in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really impressed with the California
smite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any thrips this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had one leaf I found earlier and
then my two-spot has been nil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found two leaves, I think through all my
scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, I prune heavily and
yeah, they're definitely a beast to have
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know this was unexpected,
so thank you for taking some time and
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting down with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And giving us this very intimate,
uh, tour of your, uh, this year's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, it's always a pleasure to
have you in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to show you this stuff,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Dan Jimmy from Gnome Automatics
and Shango from Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
