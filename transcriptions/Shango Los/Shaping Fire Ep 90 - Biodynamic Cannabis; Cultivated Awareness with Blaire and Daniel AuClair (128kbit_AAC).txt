[SPEAKER_02]: We all love our plants, and our cannabis
plants play an important role in our
[SPEAKER_02]: lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we as humans love something,
give it importance, and strive to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it, we call that sacred.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guests today are Blair and Daniel
Auclair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blair and Daniel Auclair are farmers of
cannabis and food at Radical Herbs Farm in
[SPEAKER_02]: Covillo, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll point out that radical is spelled
radical like the taproot, R-A-D-I-C-L-E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blair trained on biodynamic farms,
first on Maui and then at Raphael Gardens
[SPEAKER_02]: in Sacramento, located at what was then
Rudolf Steiner College.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel also started farming in Hawaii
before starting an apprenticeship at Live
[SPEAKER_02]: Power Community Farm, a horse-powered
biodynamic vegetable CSA located in
[SPEAKER_02]: Covillo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their paths came together when they met at
the farmers market in Covillo,
[SPEAKER_02]: and from there they embarked on an
agricultural endeavor together,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting married and starting a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Blair is expected to go into
labor any day now, which explains why she
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds a little out of breath in the
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are now stewards for 60 acres,
consisting of hay fields and about two
[SPEAKER_02]: acres under cultivation of vegetables and
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2018, they won the regenerative farm
award at the Emerald Cup with two other
[SPEAKER_02]: farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Radical Herbs is both Dragonfly Earth
medicine and Sun and Earth certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blair and Daniel practice biodynamics on
their farm Radical Herbs, and this year
[SPEAKER_02]: will be featured in a documentary
alongside Green Source Gardens and
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryceland Forest Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: The film, titled Tending the Garden,
is a journey through a year in the life of
[SPEAKER_02]: these three family farms cultivating
cannabis, food, and community in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pursuit of regenerative food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blair and Daniel practice a sort of
farming that embraces both science and
[SPEAKER_02]: mysticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are going to discuss biodynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Special note that the internet isn't very
robust out in Covillo, and there are a few
[SPEAKER_02]: minor audio drops in today's show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Blair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, right on, Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's start by creating a bit of
context for folk because I bet there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of folks like me who generally think
that like biodynamic growing is
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially like organic growing plus
magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, that's a little vague,
but it's also not that far off from what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so please like, like set the table for
our discussion today by watching and
[SPEAKER_02]: walking us through the philosophy behind
biodynamics and a bit about Rudolf
[SPEAKER_02]: Steiner, the father of the practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really great description of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steiner was known as the scientist of
the invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had been working his whole life
to establish a science that would be taken
[SPEAKER_01]: as legitimately as the natural sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one that studied spiritual phenomena
as opposed to or as it relates to the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted there to be a science of the
spirit to go alongside the science of
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, the natural sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he devoted his life to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a part of the Theosophical Society
back in the day with H.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blavatsky.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote books.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lectured extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: He established areas of research that
changed medicine, pedagogy, economics,
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture, the arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had his hands in everything and was a
very controversial figure, actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before he left us, he was asked by
farmers in Austria to give indications for
[SPEAKER_01]: a spiritual renewal of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually what the lectures were
originally titled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a spiritual renewal of agriculture
because these farmers, a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lectures were given on a sugar beet
estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were noticing with the onset of
chemical agriculture, they were seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: decline in soil health, a decline in seed
germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really were concerned about this
and wanted to know what they could do to
[SPEAKER_01]: combat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gave a series of lectures to
that end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where biodynamics has come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was an experimental circle that
was formed very soon after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have been working with
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a series of preparations that were
given to use in the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's field sprays and just ideas of
working with the rhythms of moon cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what could Blair say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
beginning introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those lectures were given in 1924.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people see it as the first
written organic guidelines, in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: predating what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that, too, hundreds and
centuries before that, people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing agriculture and been doing
regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just sort of in this time that
chemical agriculture started to make its
[SPEAKER_00]: way in, that there was really beginning to
see a degradation in land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that Steiner really
looked at in looking at a farm was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at it as sort of this living organism that
strives to be self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're looking at that,
you're looking at one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: things is how do we reduce the off-farm
inputs that we're bringing on into the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we create fertility on the
farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we create this organism that
can function and be able to sustain itself
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to bring a lot in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're looking at not only growing
cannabis, growing vegetables, but how do
[SPEAKER_00]: we incorporate different parts into the
farm as far as bringing the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: elements in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different types of livestock,
but a way that you can bring the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: element into the farm, if you're just even
in a backyard gardener, is to plant some
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, to grow some perennials,
grow some annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that way, you're bringing in bees,
you're bringing in pollinators,
[SPEAKER_00]: those bring in birds and all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden, you have this
vibrant, thriving animal aspect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, part of bringing in biodiversity and
creating a living organism is building
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We build fertility by making compost,
and we definitely still are lacking in our
[SPEAKER_00]: closed-loop system and still bring in
compost, bring in potting soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's always sort of like a... It's a
constant goal that we're striving to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better at, is closing those loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't always have to... It's not
always about having that animal aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: making compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for fertility, cover crops are an
amazing, excellent way to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility to the farm, a great way to keep
your soil covered, in the wintertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of closing the loop in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's a great way to also just
bring in more plant diversity to your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not only just growing in a
cannabis bed, as a tendency to just...
[SPEAKER_00]: People will grow cannabis, and then in the
wintertime, it'll just sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're bringing a cover crop in and
planting that on your cannabis beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're bringing in more diversity and
different soil roots and stuff to that
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as far as diversity, wild places are
really important, too, in creating this
[SPEAKER_00]: farm organism, in that even in the
Denverter Certification, you're required
[SPEAKER_00]: to have 10% of your farm, at least,
dedicated to wild areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know in those kinds of areas,
you're bringing in a whole dynamic array
[SPEAKER_00]: of different animals and organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way that we try to treat
our farm, in even the places that we
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate, we're trying to mimic wild
places as much as possible by having as
[SPEAKER_00]: much diversity of crops, making sure we
have flowering plants and annuals with
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and perennials for flowers,
and ensuring that there's sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: constant amount of vegetative growth all
the time to encourage a diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects and pollinators and
birds and putting birdhouses up and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, let's see, as far as the
biodynamic preparations, Daniel touched on
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go into more detail later in the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of the more well-known
parts of biodynamics is the biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation, the horn manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does one a little bit less known,
its counterpart, is horn silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two work together in sort of
relation to the cycle of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas horn manure is made from putting
manure in a cow horn, buried in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: months, and that's sprayed on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas horn silica is also put in a horn,
but buried in the summertime and used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar spray as the plants are ripening
and kind of trying to amplify the cosmic
[SPEAKER_00]: forces that are influencing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in a lot of biodynamics,
you're kind of looking at that duality of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects, not only in the type of
fertilization that we're doing as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the horn manure and the horn silica,
but looking at the rhythms of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plants and the earth are affected
by those rhythms, and then also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cosmic aspects of the earth and the
influences of the cosmos on the earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, the plants are really creatures
that are much more influenced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmos than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, there's a whole planting calendar
that people are familiar with that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go into a bit later in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants are very influenced by,
mainly by the moon, mainly by the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: first, and then by the moon, and then
there's constellations and planets and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, and then there's also,
there's the biodynamic compost preps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, the compost preps are sort of,
were indications that were given by
[SPEAKER_00]: Steiner in his lectures, and they really
look at kind of, they're really seen as
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like homeopathic preparations that
are used to bring a heightened vitality to
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are created and made in order to
bring different elements and to really
[SPEAKER_00]: create a potentized compost that then can
be used on the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I noticed right
away is that this really does sound like
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a family farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where people are going to, I don't know,
grow humans alongside growing their crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're describing 10% of a wild zone
and lots of these flowers and piles of
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks for birds to live in and hedgerows,
it sounds like a very biologically complex
[SPEAKER_02]: and abundant area, which is what I picture
when I visit regenerative farms in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California, whereas I don't
picture this when I see some of the multi
[SPEAKER_02]: acreage farms that are very, I don't know,
more sterile, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got very long rows and you can see
the high fences for protection and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see the heavier tilling equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like that seems like it would be
the antithesis of what you are describing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of like building an
agricultural area or a home place on the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm where you can grow flowers and food
and humans and animals and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seems a lot more like a
traditional abundant environment instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of more of a mechanized sterile growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, you know, like,
looking at growing cannabis too,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, and plants in general,
they're there absorbing their environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't go to other places to get
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, looking at like,
what's the type of cannabis you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the kind of food you want to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that plant being is located and what
it's absorbing has a lot of influence on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, are you getting something that's
absorbing salt fertilizers and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking or are you having something
that's growing in living soil surrounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by other plants and the communication of
other plants under the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium and that's what the plant is
absorbing and that's what you're ingesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I think that that was like a
really nice, a really beautiful picture
[SPEAKER_00]: that you painted and I think so much why
we love living where we live and the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that we live in and the other
farmers that we're surrounded by is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you know, I think, you know,
not just the community that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: create on the farm with diversity,
but also, you know, so important to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: community in general with who we're
relating with and who we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this whole process with, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to you and Daniel describe the,
you know, the embracing of nature and the
[SPEAKER_02]: coaxing the most out of nature,
inviting it to participate with you on
[SPEAKER_02]: your farm, it actually sounds a lot like
the messages that we're all sharing now in
[SPEAKER_02]: the regenerative cannabis scene,
but it's interesting to note that this
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and life philosophy,
you know, came from the 1920s where they
[SPEAKER_02]: were about to run into agriculture,
like industrial agriculture and petroleum
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers and, you know, the
mechanization of the farm and these folks
[SPEAKER_02]: were having an early reaction to being
very unsure and unsettled about that,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like we are feeling, you know,
we've got evidence now why they were right
[SPEAKER_02]: to be unsure and unsettled because now
we're at the far side of industrialized
[SPEAKER_02]: farming, feeling like, okay, we've seen
enough and we need to circle back to some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the important aspects that we've lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that fit in for you with your
picture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that there's something
more to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, obviously, there's the preps that
we're going to talk about in set two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three, but I really feel like I mean,
not to sound too woo-woo, but it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like you're farming and the ways
that you go about it are kind of as much
[SPEAKER_02]: of ritual and prayer as it is,
you know, just trying to grow good crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I would say, you know,
I think what modern agriculture has done
[SPEAKER_00]: is taken things apart and separated and
tried to create and compartmentalize
[SPEAKER_00]: things and that's not what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nature works in rhythms and
cycles and like, you know, taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: animal away from the grass and then
growing the feed over here and then all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden you're having this complete
imbalance where you're having to put these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical fertilizers on a field to grow
something and then you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: overabundance of waste from the animals
and it's just like completely out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance where we're trying to bring as
many things together in one place to have
[SPEAKER_00]: them benefit each other and work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think where biodynamics takes
it another step is trying to create ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to create pictures and imaginations for
things that we can't necessarily see or
[SPEAKER_00]: that regular science can't be able to
quantitatively measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that respect, Steiner really was
able to create some pictures and
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginations for a whole level of
spiritual, elemental things that happen on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm and in nature that we can maybe
intuitively feel or try to imagine and so
[SPEAKER_00]: in that way he kind of like took
agriculture to a different level of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, how are the planets influencing the
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the elemental beings working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the gnomes doing on the land
and different things like that where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can really not even I feel like in a
certain sense begin to imagine the
[SPEAKER_00]: different microscopic spiritual things
that are happening in the plant world in
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural world and just try to begin to
imagine how all those things are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Daniel was saying only recently we've
been able to talk at some point was saying
[SPEAKER_00]: only recently being able to understand
what mycelium is doing and how that's able
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a communication with plants and
I think that's one thing we try to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: our cannabis beds too and why we do so
much companion planting is I think really
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's this whole conversation
happening underground between the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: that is really important to have as much
diversity as possible and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: personally know that and I think that
scientists are just being able to somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: with their measurements like be able to
have an idea that there is something going
[SPEAKER_00]: on but I think that like also back in the
day in 1924 Steiner was able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is this elaborate communication
happening with plants that we can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: grasp but weren't able to grasp at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an image that he shares of the
farm being an image of a human standing on
[SPEAKER_01]: its head, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the nerve sense and the thoughts of
the plants are happening under the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and then above ground is the belly and the
reproductive organs so there's like an
[SPEAKER_01]: inversion so to make sure that the nerve
sense and the soil is active and alive is
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing for more communication to be
happening through the plants and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very fun image to work with as you're
walking around the belly of the farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil being the diaphragm separating
the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were making me think of a thing where
science wants us to have way, measure,
[SPEAKER_01]: and count to be able to tell if something
exists and it's real whereas anthroposophy
[SPEAKER_01]: and biodynamics wants to replace way,
measure, and count with levity,
[SPEAKER_01]: rhythm, and quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man that's heavy duty actually because
and actually I was like sitting here
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling right because I'm like okay so
is by is biodynamics more a strategy for
[SPEAKER_02]: farm upkeep or is it a philosophy of
living and I realize that it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: both those plus because so many of us,
me included, we're feeling more
[SPEAKER_02]: disconnected from our communities and from
nature and from our families, everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: so spread out and especially during these
quarantine days it's harder to see each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and everything and this entire way
of thinking about agriculture continually
[SPEAKER_02]: comes back to interconnectedness and kind
of like a spiritual intent like I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do these things on the farm that I know
that are good for the farm because in the
[SPEAKER_02]: end I need to produce food and cannabis so
that I can feed my family but at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time I'm going to do it with a ritualistic
intention that somehow makes it more
[SPEAKER_02]: meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like taking regular regenerative or
natural farming and turning it way up with
[SPEAKER_02]: ritual practices to give it spiritual
meaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's a fair assessment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I'm new to this so I don't know
what I'm talking about but listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: you talk about it, it makes me feel like
it's all of our bases of natural farming
[SPEAKER_02]: turned up with spiritual practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you hit the nail right on the
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a perfect summary and Steiner
even has you know also like a lecture on
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals like he knew that like this
community sort of festival spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration is also extremely important
for us I think for nature for the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to you know it's not it's
not just about making money on the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so much more than that and how can we
connect with with different parts of of of
[SPEAKER_00]: being and be more spiritual creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an element like a trend to want to
say that nature will be fine if we just
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it alone like humans need to remove
themselves from the equation but
[SPEAKER_01]: anthroposophy is kind of a way of
balancing that out to say like you cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the human element from from nature
we are a part of it and he goes on to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that like in the future the seasons will
will happen less and less unless until
[SPEAKER_01]: humans recognize their role in it like we
need to be a part and be co-creators with
[SPEAKER_01]: nature because nature needs us as much as
we need it and that puts us in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: delicate place of what is our motive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it ego driven to dominate or are we
wanting to be fair and equitable and and
[SPEAKER_01]: with each other and to you know it's a
like there's a moral element that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out of this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really illustrates how this variety of
farming and I dare say the two of you then
[SPEAKER_02]: as practitioners of this type of farming
you really have to you really have to lead
[SPEAKER_02]: with your heart and with vulnerability
right because because I can imagine even
[SPEAKER_02]: though you get great results on your farm
and even though the preparations that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to talk about in the next two
sets are very real and they're about
[SPEAKER_02]: managing nutrients and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that a lot of this really
strikes people as woo woo and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a little choosy about who you're going
to be vulnerable with about like how you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually see your your farm because you've
you've really described you know these you
[SPEAKER_02]: use this term imaginations right and I'm
sure that that's like a term of art from
[SPEAKER_02]: Rudolph Steiner but but the way that I
take it myself is like you are you are
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally using your mind and your
heart and storytelling and imagining and
[SPEAKER_02]: daydreaming and all of this stuff to
connect you with the animals and the foods
[SPEAKER_02]: and the and the nature of your farm and
you know that that's not this it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely popular right now right where
everyone's trying to sterilize everything
[SPEAKER_02]: and get everything down to that that great
quote that Daniel just said about like
[SPEAKER_02]: weights and measures and and scales right
where where everybody is approaching not
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody I don't want to be unfair so
much of farming is about bean counting now
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's spreadsheet farming where where
your kind of farming may you know still
[SPEAKER_02]: gets the the bountiful results but somehow
it has more more human meaning and
[SPEAKER_02]: daydreaming in it and that's that's a
pretty that's some radical stuff it feels
[SPEAKER_01]: by dynamics feels so good because it is so
unintellectual right like there's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: like science is like dominating our
culture right now with this
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectuality biodynamics is dirty it's
unacademic I feel and you're right the
[SPEAKER_01]: when we say the imaginations Steiner had
the three capital letter I's imagination
[SPEAKER_01]: intuition and inspiration are the three
components to developing oneself I think
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Marley was tuned into it also he had
the I threes were his backup singers but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's yeah it's very much I went got into
the weeds there it is very much
[SPEAKER_00]: unintellectual and I think it just like
creating a met like we talk about creating
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginations it's like Steiner did give
like quite specific indications of types
[SPEAKER_00]: of meditations to do and actually at night
kind of as sort of a meditate imagination
[SPEAKER_00]: and meditation to go through your look at
your day going backwards like start just
[SPEAKER_00]: laying in bed you just start to think
about like what you did that day and
[SPEAKER_00]: step-by-step go backwards and then kind of
bring it forwards and you take that into
[SPEAKER_00]: your into your dream world and to Steiner
to the dream world is also a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important place where we're able to
communicate with spiritual beings and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmos in a way that we can't imagine
necessarily do during the day it sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like there is a turn off with by
dynamics because there's a new language
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to be learned like a therac
bodies and astral bodies and living warmth
[SPEAKER_01]: and dead warmth and all these kind of
things but I would just push back against
[SPEAKER_01]: that and say that the language that we're
using is one that we had to learn at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning also and so when you take the
time to get into why these words were
[SPEAKER_01]: chosen and whatnot like it it does bring a
living quality to farming that for us I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess is continually inspiring and allow
puts us in a place of curiosity and always
[SPEAKER_01]: it it makes us take the broadest view of
what's happening as opposed to focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: what's directly in front we have to see
what's directly in front of us but then
[SPEAKER_01]: use as much of our surroundings and open
open ones perspective or perspective to to
[SPEAKER_01]: gain clarity is to like what's happened
because everything is connected and so by
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics for us is a really broad and is a
very broad way of seeing the world right
[SPEAKER_02]: on I really get that idea of the inspiring
hearing your describe it you know my my
[SPEAKER_02]: head goes two places with it the farm that
as you describe it it sounds like like a
[SPEAKER_02]: like a beautiful beautiful place that is
that is rich with smells and animals and
[SPEAKER_02]: and like a very highly expressive soil
food web right and it just it just it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds beautiful it sounds like a
beautiful like hobbiton kind of place to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and and it sounds like a great place
and yet the other side of me is is all
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh it also sounds very inefficient
and like that is your whole damn point
[SPEAKER_02]: right is that those efficiencies is what
kills human connection and you are
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally reaching out to these
imaginations and and intent when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: making these preparations so that it
builds connections because like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of at the core of the whole
bio dynamic thing right is these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections yeah I mean I mean in many
ways I would say that we're all I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: categorize as us is inefficient to I mean
as we talk about by dynamics and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know talk about why we're into it so
much we also like utilize a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different other agricultural practices to
and don't see by dynamics as like the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way like you know as far as our vegetable
farming we're really into no till bio
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive market gardening which is really
like an amazing practice in like all
[SPEAKER_00]: really focused on efficiency and you know
trying to grow vegetables with the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of disturbance to the soil and and
least amount of weeds and all this and but
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel like that there then is you know
and and regenerative agriculture and and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things but I think that by
dynamics just kind of to me a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: by dynamics is sort of just kind of also
the icing on the cake and like we're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do all these other things and then by
dynamics were able to just take it that
[SPEAKER_00]: much further into another realm of
relating to and understanding nature and
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural systems around us I like that
idea of infusing meaning into farming by
[SPEAKER_02]: adding these extra aspects like you you
mean you are you are just farmers right
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got your you got your you know your
these techniques and those techniques but
[SPEAKER_02]: you do it in a way that allows room for
for spiritual connection as well and and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're right like even even I you know
some of the vocabulary I struggle with a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit because I'm like I don't I
don't know what these words mean and that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean that you know I should you
know reject the ideas just because some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them feel foreign to me you know this is
this is merely an introduction to bio
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics so just because I don't know the
vocabulary you know it inspires me to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn more instead of to you know reject
it as as the other one more question
[SPEAKER_02]: before we go to break we're we're when
you're when when you consider your
[SPEAKER_02]: planning of your farm for the season and
we'll talk more about the calendar later
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's not really what I'm talking
about I'm talking like like do you have
[SPEAKER_02]: like like multiple layers of planning for
your farm where your plant you you're
[SPEAKER_02]: planning one layer which is the the the
germinating the planting and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting of the plants and then you have
a second layer which is the ritualistic
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual practices that you do in in in
tandem with that how do you how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: plan a bio dynamic farm when you're when
you when you also want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have intention because like like I
forget to do important spiritual practices
[SPEAKER_02]: in my life just because like I get busy or
maybe I have too much caffeine and then
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'm just like I'm just doing my
day it takes it takes effort to be
[SPEAKER_02]: reminded to do these these extra extra
spiritual practices that make us feel
[SPEAKER_02]: connected so so I guess my question to you
which I've kind of backed into is is how
[SPEAKER_02]: do you go about reminding yourself to to
incorporate the bio dynamics more
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual practices when you're also
trying to just do the day to day of a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's a great question I think I
think that's also why I feel like I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see bio dynamics as the icing on the
cake of the farm because you know we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have to you we have to continue running
the farm and managing the farm and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure things are functioning I'd say also
in a certain sense those practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of learning about it is done in a bio
dynamic way in that it often it's it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a bit things are kind of structured in
a seasonal way like the preps are made at
[SPEAKER_00]: different different times of the season
different times the year but then also
[SPEAKER_00]: like the winter time is a much more inward
slow time where we can kind of like slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down and be able to do some reading and do
kind of more of that inward inward work as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to just this you know being
outside trying to get everything done and
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just wanted to touch on what you
were saying about you know kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility of of the vocabulary and and
learning about bio dynamics I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily recommend somebody who knows
nothing about Steiner and Anthroposophy to
[SPEAKER_00]: like pick up the agriculture lectures
because it can it's it's not an easy thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to read and he did give the lectures to a
group of people who already had kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like understood a lot of his other
practices and things so there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level of like who he was
delivering that to but there is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great book called Culture and Horticulture
that's by Wolf Stoll is that her?
[SPEAKER_01]: Storl?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Culture and Agriculture a
philosophy of gardening and culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture sorry culture and
horticulture and it really does an
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent job of like making the concepts
really simple and understandable to to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and a really great introductory
book to to bio dynamics fantastic well
[SPEAKER_02]: then I will look that up myself and and
that is that is a good point that the you
[SPEAKER_02]: know some of these terms of art in any
advanced discipline is kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: secret language and not to let that be
off-putting so all right so I think that I
[SPEAKER_02]: and you and everybody listening is very
excited about learning more about these
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritually enriched farming practices so
so let's go ahead and go to our first
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial and we will be right back you
are listening to Shaping Fire and my
[SPEAKER_02]: guests today are regenerative cannabis
farmers Blair and Daniel Eau Claire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've discovered the benefits of
using cannabis it's a very small step to
[SPEAKER_02]: start making your own edibles gummies

growing so you don't have to rely on
[SPEAKER_02]: others to feel healthy well the magical
butter machine can empower your personal
[SPEAKER_02]: health by putting you in control of how
you use cannabis in your daily life I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been making my own butters and oils on the
stove for years and I much prefer the ease
[SPEAKER_02]: of using the magical butter machine I just
set it and walk away with the simple touch
[SPEAKER_02]: of a button the magical butter machine
grinds heats stirs and steeps your herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: extract all at the correct time interval

[SPEAKER_02]: magical butter.com today one of the
challenges with buying auto flower seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: is that often you'll have as many
different phenos as you will have seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: a pack that can be fun sure but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_02]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough I prefer my auto flowers to be
[SPEAKER_02]: worked enough that each pheno in the pack
really captures the aspects that the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder was intending this is why I
recommend gnome automatics to my friends
[SPEAKER_02]: and listeners who grow automatic flowering
cannabis seeds gnome automatic seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: not just crossed and released they are
painstakingly sifted again and again
[SPEAKER_02]: tested in a wide range of conditions and
taken to a level of maturity that each
[SPEAKER_02]: plant will be recognizable by its traits
traits that were hard-earned so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have your best growth cycle ever gnome
automatics became a trusted and loved
[SPEAKER_02]: brand in cannabis over the last 10 years
as Mandalorian genetics and recently
[SPEAKER_02]: changed their name to gnome automatics the
only thing that has changed is the name
[SPEAKER_02]: founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_02]: variety he releases for you to grow check
out the gnome automatics Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: gnome underscore automatics to see the
impressive plants folks are growing you
[SPEAKER_02]: can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_02]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website farms interested in bulk
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds of more than a thousand should reach
out through the website to while on the
[SPEAKER_02]: website be sure to check out the gnome
automatics shirts and other merch section
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want reliable seeds hand-built from
effort expert selection and experience
[SPEAKER_02]: choose gnome automatics for decades
Americans have enjoyed cannabis flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: and joints and bongs and bowls and now
with the normalization of cannabis use
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing across the country we have the
opportunity to enjoy smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: luxuries that simply were not attainable
before North Coast hand rolls blunts
[SPEAKER_02]: cannons rosin infused doughnuts and can
agars available in the state of Michigan
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast focuses on flavor over
everything else instead of growing their
[SPEAKER_02]: own flower North Coast goes out into the
cultivation community and creates
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships with the best growers
working with the best new cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties available surely heavy THC is a
factor but North Coast focuses on aroma
[SPEAKER_02]: complex terpene profiles and taste that
continues throughout the entire smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: experience the North Coast team curates
flowers like others curate art they seek
[SPEAKER_02]: out the best talent build relationships
helps them take their product to the
[SPEAKER_02]: highest levels and then buys their well
cured flowers in order to hand roll them
[SPEAKER_02]: just for you I really like their
hand-blown glass tips and North Coast has
[SPEAKER_02]: branched out beyond can agars into rosin
solvent list THC a diamonds and
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional hash rosin carts for on-the-go
cannabis connoisseurs to North Coast
[SPEAKER_02]: provides you with attainable luxury
offering you an ultra-premium smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: experience at a price that seems
reasonable and repeatable to find out more
[SPEAKER_02]: about North Coast line of cannabis
products visit their Instagram at North

welcome back you are listening to shaping
[SPEAKER_02]: fire I am your host Shango Los and my
guests today are regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers Blair and Daniel Eau Claire so so
let's segue into the bio dynamics calendar
[SPEAKER_02]: because for me this is this is how I first
got turned on to bio dynamics and I and I
[SPEAKER_02]: gotta admit I didn't have the most
positive response to it right away I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like why am I you know germinating seeds
with the moon cycle and stuff it like you
[SPEAKER_02]: know how I was brought up was much more
mechanical farming and and you know now of
[SPEAKER_02]: course I understand the interplay between
nature and and you know friends have
[SPEAKER_02]: explained to me small parts of why we
germinate you know at certain times of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year which I'm not gonna try to explain
because you're about to but but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to get to know more so you know
normally when we think about you know
[SPEAKER_02]: farming with the calendar we're thinking
about weather right just like is it you
[SPEAKER_02]: know when's the last frost and and when
does it get like the hottest time of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year and when do we have to be prepared
for drought and and that's all true but in
[SPEAKER_02]: this idea that you presented during the
first set of of kind of going beyond the
[SPEAKER_02]: basics of farming to this embracing of
nature being alive there's this entire bio
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics calendar that exists that is
supposed to guide us for for most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: attributes or most of the actions that we
take during farming so so please dive
[SPEAKER_02]: right into that and give us an example of
working through a calendar year of the bio
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics calendar when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure so I think one of the you know
one of the biggest things I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: really brought up just comparing like the
bio dynamic calendar to like farming with
[SPEAKER_00]: weather like we can you know we can make
those decisions of how we farm according
[SPEAKER_00]: to weather because we have legs and we can
walk outside or come inside but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are very much like weather is
weather all year round they are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like subject to to whatever is going on
and and the same with as sort of and
[SPEAKER_00]: beings who are in the ground constantly
having the world and the the earth move
[SPEAKER_00]: around it and being affected by the by the
planets and the the cosmic beings in in
[SPEAKER_00]: our solar system and so the bio dynamic
calendar it originally wasn't something
[SPEAKER_00]: that Steiner did it was actually created
by a woman Maria Thune and so it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: indications given by Steiner but she was
definitely she was a German bio dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and she did many experiments and
trying to see sort of like the qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: of of what the elements of the earth and
how that affects and the and the
[SPEAKER_00]: constellations and the moon and the
planets and how that affects plants so the
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things that it does the way
that it's sort of organized in many ways
[SPEAKER_00]: is by the the constellations by the zodiac
and not in the way that we kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it in traditional sort of astrology where
the constellations are divided evenly into
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30 degrees the the constellations in
the bio dynamic calendar are divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of their width and distance that they
have in the in the year and so they take
[SPEAKER_00]: up different amounts of time so it's not
like like Aries takes up you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: different amount of space than then Taurus
and Gemini and so the basis of how those
[SPEAKER_00]: things are are indicated is more by the
lunar cycle as the moon is passing through
[SPEAKER_00]: these constellations within a month it
passes through these constellations for
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts of time and then each of
those constellations are related to an
[SPEAKER_00]: element fire earth air water and each of
those elements are then related to
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of the plant and sort of
which part of the plant you are looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate or looking to grow so like the
fire element is related to fruit so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to grow a tomato you would
be looking at the calendar and seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: or where the moon is in an element of of a
fire planet or a fire constellation which
[SPEAKER_00]: would be Aries Leo and Sagittarius and so
the same would be so if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate a root plant that would be the
earth element and that would be something
[SPEAKER_00]: like a radish or a potato or something
that you're trying to cultivate for root
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you would be looking at like where
the moon is in those constellations and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's not like something you
have to go in and figure out and discover
[SPEAKER_00]: there's calendars that are made that you
can purchase our favorite one is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stella Natura calendar but you can also
get there is a Maria Tune calendar as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the same so for cannabis we would
be looking more at the air elements and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be because that's related to
flower and then if you're saying growing
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce or something or kale or leafy
greens that would be related to the to the
[SPEAKER_00]: water element and so if you're looking at
the calendar you it would it would tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you at different times of like the moon
it's usually around like three to three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four days depending on the length of and
the size of the constellation as the moon
[SPEAKER_00]: is passing through it would be like okay
you know on these days the moon is passing
[SPEAKER_00]: through let's say so so for cannabis the
moon is passing through an air sign like
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemini for a couple days you may want to
like that would be the time that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: it would also relate to that would be the
time that you would start you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would want to do something with the
cannabis that being said that would be I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like on the more like strict side of
things that you're constantly trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things when a certain when the moon is in
a certain constellation reflecting that
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy for us as we as we have
practiced things we have found that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more in we look at more of the larger
cycles as far as like the moon full moon
[SPEAKER_00]: and new moon and waxing and waning as far
as how we relate to to planting and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing we find that it has it can have a
tendency it was just like trying to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and trying to do the daily work of
like managing things and doing stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: like we don't recommend really like trying
to live your life by these planting
[SPEAKER_00]: calendars I think it more than anything it
also just like we've talked about creating
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginations and visualizations of things
and kind of like looking at you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: constellations and the moons and the
planets like they do have an effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and it kind of gives a picture and
a guidance to like that that can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect but you're not gonna like damage
something or you know or do something like
[SPEAKER_00]: really really poorly if you're not going
to be like following the calendar strictly
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I think it's important always to
have that context that I think that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel a little bit like sometimes I feel
like like you're following a textbook to
[SPEAKER_00]: know in a way like you said like it's kind
of can be a turnoff because like oh I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this then or that then and it's kind
of like a bit a bit restrictive and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and and I Daniel will talk
about it too I feel like it really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: to just create pictures for this like
whole other level of connection that the
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants have to its environment
and to the cosmos that we can maybe only
[SPEAKER_00]: begin and to imagine or understand and so
I think for me that's kind of like the the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting calendar and I Daniel I have both
you know apprenticed on a few different by
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic farms and as far as like our teeth
at least for me my teachers one teacher
[SPEAKER_00]: like to say that there's the tunes and the
untunes like the people who are into Maria
[SPEAKER_00]: tunes and her and her planting calendar
and the ones who don't really abide by it
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I think as far as like that is
usually the first thing that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to in by dynamics and it's
actually not even part of the Demeter
[SPEAKER_00]: certification to plant by the calendar so
yeah that's kind of my summary of it
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel you have anything to add that was
really awesome like you were saying the
[SPEAKER_01]: new moon and full moon cycle is kind of
more what we kind of go by I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: though if there's a day where everything
is just kind of like oh my god I need some
[SPEAKER_01]: direction like what should we do it is
helpful to say all right where's the moon
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and like oh it's a root crop
let's go weed the carrots let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate like and it does provide some
kind of framework to work with but it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like the for us the you know sowing
seeds as close to the new moon as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: especially coming into the new moon
definitely not like after the first
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter like after when it's waxing but
around that time is great for third seed
[SPEAKER_01]: germination because it gives the seeds
time to get their radical out get
[SPEAKER_01]: established in the soil and then by the
time the moon is up and bright the first
[SPEAKER_01]: cotyledons are able to absorb that light
and and that seems to work really well and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we also use the full moon as a time
to if if weather permitting to spray the
[SPEAKER_01]: horn manure preparation because at that
point the full moon as we know it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: all the water watery element of the earth
and so it's a really good time to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: spray happening in onto the soil so that
it can be utilized at that at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: and same with transplanting when the moon
is dark it's better for the seeds to get
[SPEAKER_01]: put the transplants to get put into the
ground so they can establish their roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and not be too overstimulated at night so
at first you know when you were describing
[SPEAKER_02]: it I was thinking oh this is this is
really much more about of the above the
[SPEAKER_02]: ritual of the farm and to creating a
context to give farming more meaning but
[SPEAKER_02]: then you just flip the script on me again
and you're like oh well actually you know
[SPEAKER_02]: when when you germinate is is related to
you know the the additional brightness of
[SPEAKER_02]: the moon and and the I don't know the
swelling of the water being pulled up you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and then and then with transplanting
you want darker so it sounds to me like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's actually a combination of both
there is this there is this kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: belief framework that is connected to the
constellations which for some farmers it
[SPEAKER_02]: will give the entire dance of the season
more meaning but also there are very real
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons behind much of it where the the
planetary bodies which we know have
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on earth are actually going to be
influencing our crops yeah definitely and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you know the the biggest influence
the biggest planetary body that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are influenced by is the Sun
right that's like the larger kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows the Sun is influencing the
plants and their growth cycle and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say the secondary one is the moon
and that one often I feel like if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like really paying attention and
really in tune you can you can you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely see what like a full moon and
spring and you're like all those weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: were like an inch big and holy moly there
how are they five inches now and we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out of here something like that
and so those I think those we can also we
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely also visually see really
when you're really paying attention and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also just incorporating into like
those examples that that Daniel was giving
[SPEAKER_00]: and then as far as like as far as like
harvest goes to you with cannabis I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bit more challenging often
especially for an outdoor operation
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're kind of a bit more subject
I feel like at least where we are to
[SPEAKER_00]: weather and sort of timing just trying to
get things in because it takes such a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time to harvest and kind of getting
everything in on time and making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a frost or rain we're kind of
a bit more like can't necessarily really
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the calendar in that respect but
then you know the the sort of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: planetary kind of like constellation
influences are those much more imaginative
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could say kind of clairvoyant
aspects that Steiner was really you know
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't develop this but just in general
that kind of philosophy of those ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can't really yet see but but a
picture to help understand and grasp them
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more for folks who are not
familiar with the clairvoyant aspect would
[SPEAKER_02]: you just explain that a little bit what is
what is this experience of clairvoyance
[SPEAKER_01]: and how does it relate to the biodynamics
clairvoyant I guess is a seer right
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who can read the script so to
speak I don't we weren't saying we're
[SPEAKER_01]: clairvoyant but Steiner certainly was and
I guess he would maybe describe that as
[SPEAKER_01]: like reading the Akashic record kind of
like the big the big movie reel in the sky
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak but he was able to that's
where all these indications came from the
[SPEAKER_01]: the speaking of elements as carriers of
spirit or that there's this interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cosmos to the earthly realm that
that permeates all of biodynamics so am I
[SPEAKER_01]: what more like what are we saying about
clairvoyance wait is that a good
[SPEAKER_02]: description yeah that works that works
just fine I like this idea that you said
[SPEAKER_02]: of the you know reading the big movie
script in the sky right the it's the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of of being aware that there is a
storyline to life and a storyline to the
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons and be being aware of that instead
of just being counting and running the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm as a business so yeah I think that
sounds like a great description so let's
[SPEAKER_02]: move on to the individual compost
preparations and I know that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: the natural farming people who are here
for the preparations less so much the the
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophy are probably glad that we're
moving on to this and and you know a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people claim to have a fantastic
results with both these individual compost
[SPEAKER_02]: preparations and the spray preparations
that we're going to be talking about in
[SPEAKER_02]: the third set so so my my general
understanding of how these work is that a
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamics believes that you should be
treating your compost piles with
[SPEAKER_02]: particular preparations of a very specific
group of of herbs and and they do they do
[SPEAKER_02]: it they do a certain job on nutrients in
the pile so so I'm not going to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain it myself since this is not my
specialty but but why don't you take us
[SPEAKER_02]: down the path of these individual compost
preparations how to make them and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: what their roles are on the biodynamic
farm yeah so I'll start with the caveat
[SPEAKER_00]: first instead of going into details and
ending with a caveat at the end but I
[SPEAKER_00]: would just wanted to say that you know
we've been both been practicing by
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics for quite a while and this past
year was the first year that we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: made all the preps on our farm and we've
always done it in in community in
[SPEAKER_00]: community groups and it's not it's not an
easy thing to do and it's not like a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not something that's like easily
achievable and you know a big reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are at least for me like that I kind of
also fell in love with this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: northern California and stuff was because
of the beedank the biodynamic association
[SPEAKER_00]: of northern California and the quarterly
meetings that would happen winter spring
[SPEAKER_00]: summer fall where we would make the
biodynamic preparations together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: those would be kind of taking care of by
one of the practitioners one of my teeth
[SPEAKER_00]: my teacher harold hovin and then you could
buy the biodynamic preparations from the
[SPEAKER_00]: organization and there's other places to
buy them also there's a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: biodynamic group in Oregon and I believe
there's a strong one in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's also a few on the East Coast and
so like in us describing these like I just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to feel like people have to
feel like it oh that's too crazy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: too hard I can't do that I think they're
really made supposed to be done in
[SPEAKER_00]: community and also that you know they they
can be purchased from the Pfeiffer Center
[SPEAKER_00]: and and different organizations too that
you don't have to make them on your own so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just my first little thing I wanted
to say and then Daniel can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: explain the preps all right that was
really good yeah JPI Josephine Porter
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute is another one yeah say that so
the the preps are discussed in the third
[SPEAKER_01]: lecture and in that he starts off I wanted
to talk about nitrogen and nitrogen's role
[SPEAKER_01]: in farming and he brings up the what he
calls the four siblings of nitrogen which
[SPEAKER_01]: is carbon oxygen hydrogen and sulfur which
is what makes up proteins and so like we
[SPEAKER_01]: had said early on wanting to work with
living chemistry like being able to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: living elements into the farm as opposed
to working with synthetically derived
[SPEAKER_01]: elements he brings up different plants
that have certain relationships to certain
[SPEAKER_01]: elements and so starting from a place of
recognizing an active interplay of spirit
[SPEAKER_01]: and form spirit manifesting in the earthly
realm on a carbon framework there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: elements attach themselves to this carbon
framework in different ways and so start
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to make compost which is a great
thing that can be done on farm which
[SPEAKER_01]: alleviates a lot of issues with with plant
diseases and whatnot by providing the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and the in the biome within the soil food
the compost being food for the microbiome
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to make certain elements available
to the plants as best we can and there are
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are creating more preparations
still out of their own observations but
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that he starts off with is the
the preps are the plants that are used in
[SPEAKER_01]: the preparations are yarrow chamomile
nettle oak bark valerian and dandelion and
[SPEAKER_01]: like Blair said this being the first this
past year the first year that we were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the element the the preparations
on our farm that's not to say that we
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't growing all the prep plants on our
farm and I think that that has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good teacher for us in a way of
getting a real good authentic connection
[SPEAKER_01]: to these plants that we have yarrow
growing everywhere there's dandelion
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up all over chamomile we continue
to make more beds of chamomile even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they volunteer every every year so growing
the plants and living amongst them and
[SPEAKER_01]: using them for teas and whatnot to just
gain an accustomed to them is a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to start but what he's saying here is that
by harvesting these plants and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them in a vessel and putting them in the
earth to absorb forces and to potentize
[SPEAKER_01]: them then become medicines that we can put
into our compost pile to enliven the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and so we can start with yarrow
and these were given numbers when they
[SPEAKER_01]: came to the New World the story that I am
familiar with is that it was said that the
[SPEAKER_01]: Americas would not take these things
seriously if they didn't have a number
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to them so I forgive me if I
don't know the numbers off the top of my
[SPEAKER_01]: head but to speak about yarrow he says
that the you know the nature spirits reach
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest the height of perfection in
their use of sulfur with with yarrow and
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's the carbon framework that the
plants are composed of and then you have
[SPEAKER_01]: these elements that attached to them in
different degrees so the yarrow being put
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bladder of a deer you enhance its
inherent ability to combine sulfur with
[SPEAKER_01]: other substances and sulfur being a really
important part of plant health chamomile
[SPEAKER_01]: is also has homeopathic amounts of sulfur
but it works on calcium in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: potash so that that is also a way of
keeping plants healthy chamomile goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: intestines so the way the vessels were
chosen is very interesting antlers are
[SPEAKER_01]: different than horns when we talk about
the horns of a cow which the I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: off topic a little bit but the horn manure
preparation we see the manure going into a
[SPEAKER_01]: horn because the horns are a way of
reflecting energy back into the animal
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas antlers on a deer have more of an
out streaming force and there's a relate
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship to nitrogen there in its
surrounding areas that has a relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bladder the nitrogen being a very
present component of urine he even says
[SPEAKER_01]: that a bladder is the is a perfect
description or image of the cosmos but
[SPEAKER_01]: yarrow being put into a bladder gets hung
in a sunny spot all summer before getting
[SPEAKER_01]: buried into the the earth over the winter
chamomile has a relationship to intestines
[SPEAKER_01]: and we know this from just how chamomile
tea is great for digestion nettle is one
[SPEAKER_01]: that does not have a nettle does not have
a vessel although some people are
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting with putting in the what's
the sheath of the heart the pericardium so
[SPEAKER_01]: nettle being the greatest benefactor of
plant growth it too contains sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: assimilates and incorporates the spirit
but currents of potash and calcium are
[SPEAKER_01]: also present in nettle iron is the one
that we're after with the nettle
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation this one gets buried a whole
year and it is infusing intelligence for
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil now in order to wanting health on
the farm we need to have a very broad view
[SPEAKER_01]: of interrelationships and calcium is a
great medium for making those
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships you can almost never have
too much calcium in your soils the oak
[SPEAKER_01]: bark is one that is put into the skull of
a domestic animal and again this is like
[SPEAKER_01]: very important that we are choosing in a
situation like this we wouldn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use lime we want to use calcium from a
living source oak bark being a material
[SPEAKER_01]: very high in calcium moving on to the the
dandelion preparation this is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: language that he uses is really beautiful
I would encourage people to try to read
[SPEAKER_01]: the lectures dandelion is said to be a
messenger from heaven that mediates the
[SPEAKER_01]: homeopathic distribution of silica and the
cosmos the dandelion goes into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesentery which is the what the intestines
are encased in in the animal and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really claim to understand all of
this stuff I guess let me just say here
[SPEAKER_01]: that working with the preparations is a
great practice of keeping your mind in a
[SPEAKER_01]: in a question like having more questions
than answers and and I've said this before
[SPEAKER_01]: but like when you think you know all the
answers to something that's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous place to be in because there's a
lot of different elements involved so when
[SPEAKER_01]: we work with these things I'm constantly
wondering what we're doing but that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really great place to be as you can
receive kind of insights that you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: expect silica is a very important element
in in our practice and dandelion has a
[SPEAKER_01]: great relation to salicylic acid and is
said to be able to attract salicylic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: from the atmosphere and make available to
the plants lastly valerian is one that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't does not get a vessel does not get
buried but is crushed is pressed valerian
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers which has a great way of
stimulating phosphorus and so once these
[SPEAKER_01]: preparations are made and they've gone
through the proper burial and process they
[SPEAKER_01]: get added to the compost pile and the if
we the more we work with compost and the
[SPEAKER_01]: layering of plant materials from our farm
manures straw bedding leaves gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: seaweeds putting all these things together
you're creating a raised you're creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: almost a living being so to speak and
you're forming chaos within that compost
[SPEAKER_01]: pile there's gonna it's going to heat up
things break down it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiologically alive adding these
preparations is said to help to almost act
[SPEAKER_01]: as antenna to help bring form to the chaos
chaos is a word for potential it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a bad word when things are in a
state of chaos they are open to influence
[SPEAKER_01]: especially cosmic influence and adding
these preparations is a way of helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide the prep the compost pile to a
healthy decomposition and bringing the
[SPEAKER_01]: different elements that we need for
healthy plant growth and soil biology to
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with each other so each of these
preparations sound like they take quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time even even the unvesseled ones
sound like it can be time-consuming is is
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea generally that you would make
these compost preparations this year to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply to next year's compost piles or or
is it not does it not really take as much
[SPEAKER_02]: time as it sounds and you can actually use
them same year no that is correct the it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the work that you do one year is for the
benefit of next year and some of them take
[SPEAKER_01]: longer than than others like some take a
whole a full year whereas others are just
[SPEAKER_01]: buried over the the winter and so it is
said that the earth is the most alive in
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter time and that can seem
backwards but it's an in-breath that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening the crystal crystalline forces
are are happening inside the earth at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time and it is kind of said that in the
summertime the earth is dreaming in plants
[SPEAKER_01]: like the sun is actually putting the earth
to sleep and it is dreaming in plant life
[SPEAKER_01]: it is like it has to like the seeds have
to germinate they have to whereas in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter time the earth is within itself and
it gets a little complex with northern
[SPEAKER_01]: hemisphere southern hemisphere that is
discussed in some lecture other lectures
[SPEAKER_01]: from the agriculture course but and it
should be said to the the amounts that are
[SPEAKER_01]: used in the compost pile is very minute it
almost can sometimes seem like it's you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not even like how can this little bit of
preparation make a difference in this
[SPEAKER_01]: compost pile so you it is possible for the
if you make you can make more than one
[SPEAKER_01]: year's worth in the fall does that make
sense for sure so you're gonna you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna make them for this year but you're
gonna make enough not only for your self
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next few years but also to share
because I get that whole community vibe
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do all let's see one two three
four five six of those all by yourself on
[SPEAKER_02]: your same farm with it like that sounds
like very time-consuming but if you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of farms that are doing this
everybody can make them one season and
[SPEAKER_02]: then and then share them at the Grange
Hall or wherever and then then everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: got enough to last them a few years so
that that makes sense both on a you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition stabilization level for the
compost pile but also for the I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: the spiritual everything is alive in our
community connecting of humans and
[SPEAKER_01]: families also for sure it's it also
happens like very close to harvest time so
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be like very inconvenient to make
to have to make the preparations and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need a cow yeah very many people have a
cow to butcher an expendable cow yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: can I can imagine the the the the
biodynamic supply store it gets pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: weird sometimes so so let's go ahead and
take our let's go ahead and take our
[SPEAKER_02]: second commercial and we'll be right back
you are listening to shaping fire and my
[SPEAKER_02]: guest today are regenerative cannabis
farmers Blair and Daniel Alclair we'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: right back for years organic cultivators
have been looking for a peat moss
[SPEAKER_02]: replacement peat moss has long been the
go-to soil amendment for water retention
[SPEAKER_02]: and container growing but organic growers
are recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_02]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_02]: releases sequestered carbon but peat moss
works so well that many have continued to
[SPEAKER_02]: use it now there is finally a
revolutionary replacement for peat moss
[SPEAKER_02]: that provides better benefits while being
a sustainable choice pit moss sounds an
[SPEAKER_02]: axe like peat moss but instead of being
mined from fragile ecosystems is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: made from upcycled organic paper and
cardboard headed for landfills pit moss is
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent at retaining water in your
substrate and creating air pockets and
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny living environments for microbes pit
moss instantly increases aeration nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: absorption and water conservation too
carefully and locally sourced pit moss is
[SPEAKER_02]: the result of decades-long research into
the use of recycled paper fibers pit moss
[SPEAKER_02]: is lightweight and easy to use and pit
moss is inert so it won't change your pH
[SPEAKER_02]: available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients pit moss is also available as an

as cannabis regulations become more
[SPEAKER_02]: demanding and consumers become more
educated it is increasingly important to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
cultivating cannabis beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_02]: have been used for decades by the
greenhouse vegetable and ornamental plant
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and today many cannabis
cultivators are moving from sprays and
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals to beneficial insects Copert has
the beneficial insects mites and nematodes
[SPEAKER_02]: microbials sticky cards and air

[SPEAKER_02]: Canada you know getting away from
pesticides is good for health and good for
[SPEAKER_02]: business and Copert is ready to help visit
Copert.com today one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till cannabis growing is so valued by
farmers is because the mycelium networks
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil remain established from year
to year and we know these fungal networks
[SPEAKER_02]: are essential because they are the
nutrient superhighways that extend far and
[SPEAKER_02]: wide in the substrate to feed your plants
the trouble with growing in new living
[SPEAKER_02]: soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
it takes most of the plants life just to
[SPEAKER_02]: create these mycelium highways dynomycho
endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant reduces
[SPEAKER_02]: that time and gets your plant eating a
wider array of nutrients faster and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: three times the concentration of the other
popular brand in the US at 900 propagules
[SPEAKER_02]: per gram of two fungal species selected
specifically for cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: dynomycho is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel
it has also been vigorously trialed by
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and food growers across the US
dynomycho is now available at grow shops
[SPEAKER_02]: and on Amazon in the United States I love
using dynomycho to both speed up the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth of the mycelium networks in the
soil but also as a biostimulant to make
[SPEAKER_02]: clone cuttings more virile you can see
side-by-sides showing the comparative
[SPEAKER_02]: growth on their Instagram at dynomycho if
you demand reliable growing results and
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate the importance of an active

[SPEAKER_02]: welcome back you are listening to shaping
fire I am your host shango low so my
[SPEAKER_02]: guests today are regenerative cannabis
farmers Blair and Daniel Eau Claire all
[SPEAKER_02]: right it's the big finish here with set
three we're getting to the part that is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably almost as popular as the
biodynamics calendar when people talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about biodynamics and that is these these
spray preparations and we're gonna start
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically the most the one that people
talk about the most which is the the horn
[SPEAKER_02]: manure and the horn silica spray
preparations and you know this was the
[SPEAKER_02]: number one thing that I heard people
talking about about at emerald cup two I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess it's probably been three years ago
now in the regenerative area the horn
[SPEAKER_02]: manure preparation demonstration is like I
probably heard about that for like an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire year afterwards people talking
about how interesting and engaged and how
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're like oh my god there's so
many more aspects to learn and so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about learning this myself because
I actually missed that presentation so
[SPEAKER_02]: let's start with that if you would please
explain the the the horn preparations and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and how to do them sure thing well
that's very interesting to hear I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that would have been us that was there
given that presentation and the the horn
[SPEAKER_01]: manure preparation is really one of the
most fun aspects of of biodynamics for me
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like and it's a really great way of
engaging with your land in in this thought
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way biodynamics is presented in the
way we start to visualize the farm like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's we have to understand that the the
plants that we see on the earth are said
[SPEAKER_01]: to originate in the farthest reaches of
the cosmos the plants only exist because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the earthly realm and they are a mirror
so to speak like plants the archetype of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is radiating out from this from
the distant cosmos and manifesting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth being reflected back and so if you
think of the that gives us a periphery and
[SPEAKER_01]: center image and we want the plants to be
able to fully express themselves and and
[SPEAKER_01]: engage with the earth and be earthbound as
best they can so a way of doing that and
[SPEAKER_01]: of enlivening the soil to allow for that
connection to take place there is a field
[SPEAKER_01]: spray that is done throughout the spring
and in the wet part of the year where
[SPEAKER_01]: there can be a the water allowing for a
the soil to receive the spray but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the manure from a cow and putting
it into the horn of a cow and that image
[SPEAKER_01]: if your imagination will allow you paints
a picture of opposite ends coming together
[SPEAKER_01]: you have form on the on the one side of
the with the horn and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: formlessness the manure from the other end
being brought together then that is put
[SPEAKER_01]: into the earth over the winter time to
absorb the the forces streaming down into
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth from the cosmos throughout the
winter and all the activity that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening under the ground so that way of
taking two opposing ends and bringing them
[SPEAKER_01]: together is a reflection of the opposing
periphery and center of the archetype of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and the earth at the at the
center so this preparation then being
[SPEAKER_01]: unearthed from the ground is you'll see it
teeming with um with mycorrhizal and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes out if done long enough or you
know buried at the right depth it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out smelling delicious and is a very
earthy smell crumbly you can tell that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's potentized that it was it's gone on
it's gone through a change this also being
[SPEAKER_01]: used in a homeopathic dose is then put
into water it's like a tablespoon for like
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallons or so it's it's not very much
we tend to put a little bit more in ours
[SPEAKER_01]: because we feel like the land needed it
needs it but this this then goes through a
[SPEAKER_01]: stirring process and this this is
something that will become individual for
[SPEAKER_01]: each person but it feels like an hour is a
good amount of time you add this
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation into preferably rainwater and
it is stirred in one direction to form a a
[SPEAKER_01]: an organized vortex for a minute and then
that is thrust back on itself and stirred
[SPEAKER_01]: in the opposite direction also for a
minute and then this process is repeated
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said for about an hour and in this
process you will find a change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water one of more like organization at
first it it splashes a lot you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: get splashed in the face and and it's it's
not as organized as you begin to do it the
[SPEAKER_01]: water seems to take on a more organized
component it's sometimes referred to as
[SPEAKER_01]: the fifth phase of water this is then
sprayed over the fields like over your
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated areas and even beyond in very
minute doses I like to refer to it as
[SPEAKER_01]: micro dosing your your land this is done
in the early mornings you want to be out
[SPEAKER_01]: there I'm sorry this is done in the
evening so that it is given time to you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want it to evaporate you want to get
it onto the land and then be have time to
[SPEAKER_01]: be absorbed and this is something that
should be done on repeated intervals and
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of that process is somewhat
I would say up to you yeah but stick with
[SPEAKER_01]: it if you're you want to do it after a
rain like I said before at it when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: wet you can you want to utilize the full
moon because the full moon like we said
[SPEAKER_01]: before has a obvious effect on all the
watery elements of the earth and it is it
[SPEAKER_01]: it can also help to propel what you are
doing further like you're spraying minute
[SPEAKER_01]: doses on the land but then that full moon
activating the water it's being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate more deeply and with repeat
sprays you you know the benefits are what
[SPEAKER_01]: Steiner says is and it seemed to suggest
that he was aware of what mycelium was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing before mycelium was as studied as it
was but he says this will help bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: elements from beyond the cultivated space
it brings in elements being that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is connected under the ground
you're bringing in elements from your your
[SPEAKER_01]: woods from your fields from where the
animals are grazing so it's the horn
[SPEAKER_01]: manure preparation is helping bring the
periphery down to the earth and allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants to be to receive that radiation
that's coming to them from the archetype
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cosmos the cosmos not just being a
place of stars and comets but of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: home of spiritual beings so that is a
gravitational pole that you are providing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant with the horn manure the horn
silica is the counterpart to the the
[SPEAKER_01]: gravitational pole and it would be the
levitational pole so this is finely ground
[SPEAKER_01]: quartz crystal that is made in the spring
and is buried throughout the summer and
[SPEAKER_01]: winter dug up in the fall so this spray is
then what you use to help the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve its its ripening to allow it to go
through its fruit forming process its
[SPEAKER_01]: flower forming process that you want it's
helping to allow what you are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: ripen in time and achieve the the health
that it is capable of getting so you are
[SPEAKER_01]: as well spring using minute doses of
finely ground quartz crystal in water
[SPEAKER_01]: going through the same stirring process as
you did for the horn manure and then
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying this onto your plants in the
early morning before sunrise or just at
[SPEAKER_01]: sunrise in that dawn time and it is
helpful to use a backpack sprayer for this
[SPEAKER_01]: one when you apply the horn manure we use
a combination of different things like
[SPEAKER_01]: little handheld brooms or cedar branches
tied together and you're kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: flinging the water all over the place I
don't really like putting that mixture
[SPEAKER_01]: through a sprayer just because of the the
pressure that the water goes through
[SPEAKER_01]: through the handle and through the whole
process that doesn't feel as natural as
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of flinging it from a bucket
with a with some cedar branches but the
[SPEAKER_01]: the quartz spray the the horn silica is
much more conducive to being sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: through a backpack sprayer and you're
trying to cover you want to kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: fill in the aura of the plant you're
spraying above it and you can see it
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just kind of misting and then
falling and mixing with the dew that's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and as the sun's coming it's a
really beautiful fun process to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the horn manure you're spraying at
the time in the spring to help get the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots established the quartz the horn
silica you're spraying in the early summer
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever whatever you're growing once you
start to see the ripening fruits of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing you want to start spraying
the quartz the horn silica then so we
[SPEAKER_01]: often start our spray for the cannabis at
the end of july beginning of august that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what we have found is when anthesis begins
on the plants and so from that point on
[SPEAKER_01]: we're spraying you know every other week
or like three to four times throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: the ripening season what have i missed i
was just going to mention a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: like why the cow horn and i think in
general in biodynamics cow horns are are
[SPEAKER_00]: really important like in certification
you're not allowed to have cows without
[SPEAKER_00]: horns and unfortunately it's a you know
it's a common practice to remove horns
[SPEAKER_00]: from cows and the cows horns are extremely
important for the cows their sinuses
[SPEAKER_00]: actually go up into the horns and in there
is part of the cow just in general is this
[SPEAKER_00]: very sort of meditative very focused on
digestive animal when you see it it
[SPEAKER_00]: ruminates you know that's where that whole
word comes from it it eats its food but
[SPEAKER_00]: then after it does that it'll then sit
down and start ruminating and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has four you know the cow has
four chambers four chamber stomach and
[SPEAKER_00]: that food that it eats gets moved around
into these four chambers actually comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the mouth after it's been eaten
they continue to chew it and they goes
[SPEAKER_00]: back down and all this process that
happens within the stomach and that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the flavors and the taste and the
digestion gets circulated within the horns
[SPEAKER_00]: too and it's kind of said that the horns
have a bit of like the cow is kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the guru of the meditative guru of the of
the animal world and it has sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: connection the horns to to the cosmos the
the horns and the hooves kind of contain
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of the two ends of the of the
animal that kind of contains this
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive process and has much more of
that solid sort of formative process and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like pyramids and cones and that
sort of thing kind of have this very the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of formative condensing shape as far
as their what what they look like and so
[SPEAKER_00]: putting manure into these into this vessel
really creates that sort of kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about when you're stirring
kind of going from this chaos this like
[SPEAKER_00]: very loose substance manure and putting it
into this highly highly formed very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex thing that is that is the cow horn
and then you're also on top of a layer
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes on top of that is as you're
stirring you are able to imbue your own
[SPEAKER_01]: forces into the mixture like it's very
important to be aware of your thoughts as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing that and it's amazing to see
how your thoughts can travel within that
[SPEAKER_01]: hour but having an intention that you
bring into what you're doing is I we feel
[SPEAKER_00]: is definitely felt and I think that like
to these preparations can be purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: from different Biden Amit groups and or
the Josephine Porter Institute and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's almost in a way more important
than making them is super important but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not something you have to do but it I
think I'm so glad Daniel brought that up
[SPEAKER_00]: because it really is this meditative
process that happens within the stirring
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think just in general and
biodynamics your intention and your
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints and your presence on the land
is so important and I think that that that
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying these preparations give you gives
you a moment to pause and to focus more on
[SPEAKER_00]: our sort of like mental intentional ways
that we are working with the land and part
[SPEAKER_01]: of me as we're as we're talking about this
I'm trying to think about what people
[SPEAKER_01]: might be thinking about this and I will
bring up and just be honest that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to and still somewhat is it's
something that I think about a lot like
[SPEAKER_01]: how is it that we are taking this crystal
from the earth and smashing it up smashing
[SPEAKER_01]: it to pieces and then spraying it on our
fields like there's an extractive element
[SPEAKER_01]: to that and Steiner says that by doing
this we are freeing up elemental beings
[SPEAKER_01]: that the crystals are home of elemental
beings they're an impression that the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth has felt over time that we are then
able to release and this takes us down a
[SPEAKER_01]: really long rabbit hole of how what is
going on with the mineralization of the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth and how we're transforming the
mineral element of the earth the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: realm is being transformed and not always
with the best of intentions but it is one
[SPEAKER_01]: to meditate on like how this fits into to
that and I will just say that it feels I
[SPEAKER_01]: have come to peace with it a bit when this
process is done in a way that we hope is
[SPEAKER_01]: serving nature and the ecology that
surrounds us because there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: destructive element it feels like that
you're taking a quartz crystal really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful symmetrical divinely shaped
thing and then smashing it into pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: where the surface area is larger than the
the whole of the plant we there's a mentor
[SPEAKER_01]: that we engage with who gave an
demonstration of the of quartz crystal
[SPEAKER_01]: showing how he held the quartz and dropped
it into his hand there's the gravity pole
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he crushed this thing up to a
point it was in his hand he just blew on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it just lifted up into the air in
this way of demonstrating levity and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to say that there is a tension
that kind of exists in in the horn silica
[SPEAKER_01]: prep because manure is very available you
know feed your cow and you'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: something out of it but the harvesting of
quartz crystal is something that is a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a of a stretch so I just wanted to
bring that up right on so um you know so
[SPEAKER_02]: much of this preparation I mean I
recognize parts of it um as foliar prep
[SPEAKER_02]: right just like things that I I have done
many times in different recipes but then
[SPEAKER_02]: there is then there are these additions
that are you know stir it you know in in
[SPEAKER_02]: in clockwise for um you know x amount of
time and then and then and then
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately stir it the other way and so
so that you're getting some of that chaos
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it and then it reorganizes itself
and and it's interesting because there
[SPEAKER_02]: really is a blending of organic practices
that I recognize that I'm like oh I've
[SPEAKER_02]: done something that like that before and
then there and then and then suddenly
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about how the the horn
manure prep is is an illustration of the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning and the ending and completion of
nature because since the horn is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: head of the cow and the and the manure
comes out the back end and I'm like oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: gosh I thought I was in there I was you
know for a second there I thought I was in
[SPEAKER_02]: the realm of of scientific preparations
that I know and then now now suddenly I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: in the dreaming you know and I'm and I'm
and I'm and I'm doing a an imaginative
[SPEAKER_02]: energetic preparation that is causing me
to sit down and reflect and get manure on
[SPEAKER_02]: me and think about how it's not dirty like
suddenly it gets like really big a prep
[SPEAKER_02]: that sounds like something that I want to
do to have my cannabis plants grow and my
[SPEAKER_02]: farm to be abundant and healthy has
suddenly turned into you know personal
[SPEAKER_02]: mysticism and personal growth and I'm like
oh my god there's so much here and it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of makes bio dynamics like I don't know I
guess I'll say a bit slippery and not in
[SPEAKER_02]: any disrespectful way it's kind of like
bio dynamics is is kind of different for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody where where you learn bio
dynamics and and it's in this this it's
[SPEAKER_02]: collection of philosophies and
preparations and then after that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: given to you and then each farmer will
make it their own based on their personal
[SPEAKER_02]: life experience and like I dare say what
the farm tells them and if I would you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if I would just say that to most
groups of cannabis people I think that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would get some eye rolls but hearing you
talk about it you know it sounds it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: less like an eye roll and more like a like
a spiritual practice that has meaning to
[SPEAKER_02]: each individual people but maybe not in
the same way to a group and and and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I find that to be a rare thing in
cannabis right and and what so what are
[SPEAKER_02]: your thoughts on that being as much of a
spiritual practice as it is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer well we ask a lot of our of the
land it's it doesn't feel comfortable for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to to expect the land to continue to
provide without any sort of recapitulation
[SPEAKER_01]: and ever since learning about these ideas
and these practices it hasn't felt right
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to not do them the land provides
it's abundant and it but it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: have something given back and if this in
this is a small part of that but it does
[SPEAKER_01]: feel very important and it is very much a
spiritual practice one that helps to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect us to the land us to the plants
dare I say the cosmos and I think I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of somewhat of a famous quote from Steiner
is that you can never have a spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: without matter or matter without spirit
and so I think that kind of sums up where
[SPEAKER_00]: where he's coming from and that we can't
ignore the the unseen but I think try to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize and and embrace things that we
can feel yeah I like that idea things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can feel you something that I just
wanted to tag on to that when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the preparations I failed to
to bring nitrogen back into the the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation the equation we talked about the
other siblings carbon oxygen hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur but nitrogen never came back up and
I was just reminded of it because he says
[SPEAKER_01]: that farmers should meditate and it's very
important for them to do so but when but
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware of actually what we are doing
when we meditate and he says that we're we
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing into an experience of the
nitrogen that surrounds you because we
[SPEAKER_01]: think of nitrogen is something that you
need to feed to your plants in order for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to grow but the nitrogen is there
what he says as a way of of a sit of
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the other elements to work
through the plant and so when we sit down
[SPEAKER_01]: and meditate we are growing into the
nitrogen in the atmosphere which there is
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of and then that is where we are
able to get impressions from the farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: from the land that we might not have had
we not taken the time to do that and
[SPEAKER_01]: stirring 500 is a great meditation
meditative practice and so yep that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I wanted to bring to that
right on so you know I'm sure there are
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are listening who are
considering the the spiritual aspects but
[SPEAKER_02]: then they they also actually want to do
these preps and so much of what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in in regenerative and natural
farming right now are you know you know
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of preps and fermentations you
know a lot of them coming from Korean
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming how how does how do these
preps play with the others you know from
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm hearing from them it actually
sounds like they're all in the same gang
[SPEAKER_02]: and and all these different preps can work
together with the the other natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming preps that that we might be more
familiar with but but I bet I better ask
[SPEAKER_02]: because there might be some part of the
the spiritual structure that makes that
[SPEAKER_02]: not as applicable so so how do these preps
interact you know and play nice with other
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming techniques I think they
play great with each other I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know it's all I feel like we
don't practice very much Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming but we do we do do some other
fermentations with plants and stuff and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I I don't think you like I would never say
you should do one or the other I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that at all and I think that it's
important to grasp on all different kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of of agriculture and I think it's it I
think things go wrong when you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: think you should only be farming a certain
way and that I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather from all different types of
practices and and utilize the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good good to you and you know that's
you're creating your farm and did you
[SPEAKER_00]: individuality and and creating the systems
that work best for you right on so the
[SPEAKER_01]: horn manure is a way of it's almost like a
IMO collecting collection oh yeah it is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like an IMO for sure yeah yeah so
so there a lot of them are are sharing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the same you know overall
strategies even though the form and
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly in this case the the spiritual
intent is is certainly more involved and
[SPEAKER_02]: so to kind of you know finish up this show
with that you know I guess spiritual
[SPEAKER_02]: intent vibe you know when I when I when I
talked to you all before our recording and
[SPEAKER_02]: and and and read some of the Steiner stuff
everything seems to be very future focused
[SPEAKER_02]: there seems to be a real awareness of of
inertia and that you know we we know we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to end up in the future and so let's
try to do something now so the future is
[SPEAKER_02]: better so would you both take us out with
a couple words on this idea of bio
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics as a vehicle towards the future
because honestly we just don't we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get a lot of that and a lot of the other
farming traditions for sure and thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: for asking it what really attracted me to
bio dynamics is that it does speak to us
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that I had not found in other
literature and other philosophies and when
[SPEAKER_01]: when we speak of the earth as a as a
living being that that's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: can just kind of get said and then we move
on to the next thing but through
[SPEAKER_01]: familiarizing ourselves with Steiner's
work he is very much wanting to drive home
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are living on a highly developed
spiritual being and the we are locked into
[SPEAKER_01]: this direction towards the future of which
we need we're here to learn lessons of how
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that future happen and the plants
are one of our first teachers in doing so
[SPEAKER_01]: and so when we work with the land when we
work with these imaginations that we find
[SPEAKER_01]: the imaginations that give us the ideas of
making these preparations of putting these
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs into these vessels when we work with
these ideas at first they can seem far out
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are but they start to bring up
feelings that that teach us lessons of of
[SPEAKER_01]: of where we're going though and what is
that what is the lessons that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to teach us and what is being
said is that when we learn to to when we
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to coexist with each other the way
plants coexist with each other we will be
[SPEAKER_01]: in a place receptive to feel the love that
we can freely give back to the creator and
[SPEAKER_01]: so when we observe the way plants of
different species grow next to each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and seem to be good companions for each
other we think of what's happening under
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil with the roots we think of the
communication that's going on we feel we
[SPEAKER_01]: see that there is this idea that one
cannot be happy if the other is not happy
[SPEAKER_01]: and we learn how plants are able to help
bring in nutrients from afar if someone if
[SPEAKER_01]: a different plant needs it we see this
communication that is done out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: freely given like a gift economy so to
speak right like we do this as a way as an
[SPEAKER_01]: offering and I believe that very
wholeheartedly that when we engage with
[SPEAKER_01]: the land when we're farming we are not
just farming to create like substance for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to eat we are beautifying the
surroundings that our senses will gain
[SPEAKER_01]: nourishment just as much as we gain fuel
to to exist we need to eat but we also
[SPEAKER_01]: need to absorb beauty and kindness and by
dynamics is what awoke me to these ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: in these imaginations and it goes on from
there then once we exit the the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: realm we attain the animal consciousness
where we learn to feel into the other
[SPEAKER_01]: being and then we move on to only will we
be truly human whether we are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the ego of another as we
understand our own and it gets it goes on
[SPEAKER_01]: from there but I do believe what by
dynamics has to offer beyond other
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophies is this larger picture that
we're dealing with things more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: elements more than just nutrients we're
dealing with transformation metamorphosis
[SPEAKER_01]: and growth that will bring us into the
next stages of spiritual spiritual
[SPEAKER_01]: development and the next evolution of the
earth that we are all caught up in well
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly I think that all of us who are
regenerative farmers and and I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the the all of us who who
participate in the very soul of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant would share this idea of
you know embracing the interaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: spirit and with nature now and expressing
our love in ways that I don't know nurture
[SPEAKER_02]: and bless the future and whether no matter
the words that we use to express that idea
[SPEAKER_02]: it can only be good and and I'm grateful
that that bio dynamics as a you know as a
[SPEAKER_02]: as a farming philosophy and as I'm
learning is more of a more of a life
[SPEAKER_02]: philosophy as much as a farming philosophy
you know it's nice to have some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: importance injected into our farming in a
day and age where there are so many
[SPEAKER_02]: pressures to encourage farmers to look at
