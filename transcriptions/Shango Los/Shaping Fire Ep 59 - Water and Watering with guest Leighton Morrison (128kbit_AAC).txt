[SPEAKER_00]: British science fiction writer Arthur C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clarke is known for saying any
sufficiently advanced technology is
[SPEAKER_00]: indistinguishable from magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've always felt about my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't particularly know much about how
my car runs other than the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, I do maintenance, but what really
goes on under the hood might as well be
[SPEAKER_00]: magic to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: After beginning to study soil life and the
rise of sphere and depth, I realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that same regard for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just kind of watered my plants
without really knowing what was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: under the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had other stuff I had to do,
so I just added water and went about my
[SPEAKER_00]: other business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its own way, too, water is
indistinguishable from magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: During today's episode, we're going to
talk about what water is and where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from, water harvesting, the
responsibility that water has inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, some thoughts on water quality,
and finally some best practices for
[SPEAKER_00]: actually watering your plants and
listening to the plant telling you her
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.

[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is geologist and living
soil expert, Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton has been a lifelong enthusiast of
both aquaponics and living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: His obsession with Biosphere 2 led him to
set up an aquaculture system with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodeo Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton worked with world-renowned soil
biologist Dr. Elaine Ingham, blending his
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaculture byproducts with traditional
compost and worm castings to prove that
[SPEAKER_00]: natural inputs could effectively replace
synthetics and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton currently is founder of Kingdom
Aquaponics and invented their line of
[SPEAKER_00]: living compost and compost tea products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton is a sought-after speaker and
co-founder of the series of traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: Science of Organic Regenerative Cannabis
Cultivation conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton was recently here for episode 54
to talk about soil, its geological
[SPEAKER_00]: origins, and how to mirror the layers of
the earth in your container garden for
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum microbe life and water drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the recording, Leighton and I talked
at length about water, and this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: started to form in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided with the outdoor growing season
coming up fast, an in-depth discussion of
[SPEAKER_00]: water would be in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we scheduled a second episode together
pretty quickly, and today we offer it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to be back, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're really happy to have you back,
and again, so surprisingly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I missed my recent trip down
there because we're all in quarantine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll look forward to seeing you down
there in Southern California when I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that
everybody, including me, really liked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the last time you were on the show
is that you're not afraid to talk in
[SPEAKER_00]: geological terms, which when you're
talking about soil is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really informative, and I figured,
you know, let's jump right into the deep
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the pool this time again and start
with a, you know, start with a meta
[SPEAKER_00]: question that, you know, we all are so
concerned and aware of the quality of our
[SPEAKER_00]: water and how much water that we are
feeding our plants and making sure we use
[SPEAKER_00]: clean water for compost teas and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, where did water come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's definitely jumping into the
deep end, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, there's two trains of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: One train, which has been pretty much
typical of science up until recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was it came from comets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was not originally here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we know somewhat of how the
planets are formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the surface of the earth was
molten rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, how does water stay on
molten rock, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the theory up until recently
was that it all came from comets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know for sure that there is a
tremendous asteroid belt that has just
[SPEAKER_02]: limitless comets that are all water that
are trapped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some other geophysicists are starting
to say that no, no, no, it came from a
[SPEAKER_02]: material called carbonaceous chondrite,
all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the earliest known
minerals, generally considered an
[SPEAKER_02]: asteroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ironic thing is that it has about
20% mineral content of water in a solid
[SPEAKER_02]: form that's not ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets complicated, all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the theory, this theory is that no,
no, no, the water was always here,
[SPEAKER_02]: formed in the rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just took up the heating process and
then the cooling process for that to be
[SPEAKER_02]: set free and to rebond into H2O,
as we know water today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, again, science will probably
come up with more answers for this as time
[SPEAKER_02]: progresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, science is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in the few years that I've known you,
look what's happened to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the biological kingdoms have broken
up, diatoms are now thrown into the algae
[SPEAKER_02]: kingdom, flagellates are now thrown into
the algae kingdom, and they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: all going to shift again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an interesting time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we have such incredibly
powerful tools that we never used to have
[SPEAKER_02]: even five years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that regard, it's pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got to believe that because of the
volume of water on our planet,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was some kind of terrestrial
impacts that were caused by comets that
[SPEAKER_02]: brought in that huge mass amounts of ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I don't, you know, I'm not a
scientist of that sort, but it could also
[SPEAKER_00]: appear to me that it could be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the water came from comets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I mean, you just totally
blew my mind that there could be deposits
[SPEAKER_00]: of water that was solid, that was not ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh God, I need to go look up the
Wikipedia on that to even, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not on my show, but that is another's
buddy's science show in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so bizarre that most of the
metals in these you know, chondrites are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually in a silicate, oxidate and
sulfides form.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that shows you, you know, that there's
some science here that we haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: to yet that will probably answer some of
these questions in better detail as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we learn more and more about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: My gut feeling is, was it was a
combination of both to answer the question
[SPEAKER_02]: bluntly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's, let's bring us up multiple
billions of years to the now and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more grounded in how water and how
we're using it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the role of freshwater in this,
in the soil of our pots and fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that a lot of us,
including me, tend to take water for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you put the water in and
it causes some life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if my plants droop, add more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much like as much as
most of us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, but I know from talking with you
that there are, there's actual jobs that
[SPEAKER_00]: water has in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'd all be interested in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so please wait into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the universal solvent in terms of
pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have a acid or a base, they do
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they attract different minerals to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and in the periodic table,
these elements are available in different
[SPEAKER_02]: pHs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are available only in low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are available in high pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally most of these elements are
available in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call neutral water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding that water is an acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take you, I'm going to take
you back to nuclear science.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they originally started building
nuclear reactors to generate power,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first thing that they noticed was that
they would have mineral realization
[SPEAKER_02]: occurring on the rods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rods would get thicker,
thicker as the minerals came out of
[SPEAKER_02]: solution and attached themselves to these
rods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if two rods touched each,
touched each other, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called a meltdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing good comes from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they quickly realized that they could
not use regular spring water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed to do a scrub, a mineral scrub
of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then came reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to understand reverse osmosis
technology, it's essentially like putting
[SPEAKER_02]: water in a rubber glove and squeezing it
through the pores of the rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: How deep is that, dude?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's just like a ridiculous
level of filtration is the idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're basically stripping it down
to H2O.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else is coming through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, water is the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it eats everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can either preserve it or it can eat
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a unique element in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention, you can't live without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No life would be created if we did not
have water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has water in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the commonality of all forms of
life on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that regards, if you take water and
you squeeze it through a rubber glove and
[SPEAKER_02]: you get just H2O, as soon as that water
comes in contact with anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to automatically start pulling
stuff off of it because it's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Its essence is to transport nutrients,
minerals, vitamins throughout the body,
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the plant, throughout the soil
system, and into the microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has to have water as a base for
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deeper you dive down that rabbit hole,
to just think that this one element,
[SPEAKER_02]: this one thing is the foundation of all
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its role in the soil then is
essentially to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a grabber and a mover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its very existence makes sure that,
I don't know, nutrition and other things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhizosphere are not sedentary and
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of the ways that I consider
mycelium networks, water is its own kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of movement network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a solvent and it's a
transporter and it can release these
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals and vitamins, consider it a
taxicab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your comparison to the mycorrhizae
or saprophytic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's moving one thing to other places and
allowing whatever is never necessary to be
[SPEAKER_02]: brought to the table in all life forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the only, I guess I'll say,
engine to move the water gravity so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when we water, the water starts at the top
of the soil and then gravity is pulling it
[SPEAKER_00]: down until, I guess, that it becomes such
a small amount that there's no longer a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant gravitational pull and then it
just stops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even after water comes to rest,
does it still have a tendency to move?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know water has a unique ability to
be in a liquid, gas or solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you missed one thing called evaporation
and also wicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the presentation I did at Humble
this year at the conference, I put up a
[SPEAKER_02]: slide showing a bottle of water with red
dye in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gentleman dipped a hemp wick into
the one bottle that was full all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: down until it got wet, right to the top of
his fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he pulled the wick out and
stuffed that wick into the bottle that was
[SPEAKER_02]: empty next to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened over the course of 48
hours was they equaled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's water moving against gravity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going up the string, over and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water has some really unique properties
that are very different from pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, any other element on this planet
because, again, it can be liquid,
[SPEAKER_02]: solid or gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in evaporation, which is really cool,
the water is getting purified.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting distilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sun comes out, evaporates the water
off the ocean and desalinates it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that H2O in a gaseous form goes up
into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets cold and it starts to collect
together and to form clouds and then those
[SPEAKER_02]: clouds get very, very dense and compacted
to the point where those molecules start
[SPEAKER_02]: to touch each other and they start to form
raindrops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they come back to earth pure and
clean until air pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have acid rain and alkaline rain
and all these other problems with the
[SPEAKER_02]: earth cleaning and cleansing the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with my originally suggesting that
gravity just pulls the water down in our
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and fields and you now adding
evaporation and wicking, is it possible
[SPEAKER_00]: that after I water and the water finds its
way down to the bottom of the pot that the
[SPEAKER_00]: dryness of the pot above it could wick the
water back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it possible that during the warmth
of the day the water could evaporate up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the upper layers of the pot without
leaving the container?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, remember, that's why we got into
that soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the A horizon is the heart and
lungs, is the ability for water to wick
[SPEAKER_02]: from lower back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without that, if you were just organic
matter, the answer is no, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have that tight pore space that's
required to allow wicking to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to the last podcast, we talked
about the horizons and how critical they
[SPEAKER_02]: are to function in a natural system
because that's exactly what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The surface dries out due to the sun and
the wind and naturally because of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: system was built through geological time,
it allows that migration, that wicking to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen and pull the moisture from down
deep, perhaps groundwater even lower,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be wicked up into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have a better understanding that
water is not going just in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually moving around based on
wicking, the composition of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: day and night, heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I guess this is how it explains
to me how that taxi cab service really
[SPEAKER_00]: works because as water is being pushed and
pulled in all these different directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes a vehicle for all these other
nutrients that since water is grabby and
[SPEAKER_00]: moves, the water is going by these
nutrients as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grabs these nutrients and then it's
pushed and pulled all around the pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how it's moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a reasonable way to describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about bubble hash, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the universal ultimate solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does everything from breaking things
down to preventing them from breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the pH in the bogs up in
Russia where we find those mammoths that
[SPEAKER_02]: are completely mummified, the reason they
were mummified, they were in water,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the reason they were mummified was
because of the pH, not the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you look at water in swamps
where it's just rotting trees and roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: else down and turning it into organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, again, a very,
very cool element and it's something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could ponder pretty long and hard
about the power of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last question I want to ask you
before we start moving on to our first
[SPEAKER_00]: break is that one of the things that I've
realized from being primarily an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grower is that when I take my pots at the
end of the season and I throw them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garage just for storage, and then when I
bring them out in the spring, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I add water to them,
there's a breath of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sunshine and some water changes the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, after hearing you at the
regenerative conference in Michigan last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, I realized I should no longer be
putting my pots in the garage over the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should just let them be outside,
let them go through a full year cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I come back in the spring,
they've like totally gone feral,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more worms and more life and just
more everything in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just going to put a little hole
in it and put my start into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off they go on gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that a lot of folks keep their
pots like I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we put them in the barn or whatever,
and they kind of fall asleep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of think about it as the
soils hibernating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know though that a lot of the
constituents of the soil wake up when we
[SPEAKER_00]: add a little bit of warmth from the
sunshine and some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does water do to a dehydrated
rhizosphere that brings it back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look at it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason the pot goes hydrophobic is
because the bacteria that's colonized on
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface of the potting mix or the
organic matter or the sand, silt,
[SPEAKER_02]: and clay, whatever it is, cyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they find themselves in a hostile
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they basically create a wax coating
around the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when I did some work way
back down in the University of Arizona,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always be so intrigued at how soil
could float.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd grab a handful of soil, throw it in a
bucket of water, and it would float.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason was because of the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacteria had cysted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now because it's wax coated on the
outside of it, it basically can't sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't open up and dissolve into
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the real answer is that that's driven
by the bacteria and the other biology
[SPEAKER_02]: because it has cysted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know for sure that these cysts,
whether they're bacteria or protozoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: can live in ice for hundreds of thousands
of years, maybe more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also know that pretty much life
came from comets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those comets were floating around
in nothingness for who knows how long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then come into the Earth's atmosphere,
heat up, like you said, warm up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ice melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, all of those microbes
come back to life again because they have
[SPEAKER_02]: found themselves in an environment that
supports them and allows them to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the fact that you listen to me
and keep your pots outside because what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening is in those seasons,
there's definitely some ice forming in
[SPEAKER_02]: there as the temperature gets colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's forming little water pockets
trapped in that soil mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the temperature warms up
outside, things slowly come back to life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not taking this pot that's
completely dried out, dumping water on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and hoping that the water starts to sink
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take you days to get those
to recharge when you're allowing them to
[SPEAKER_02]: do naturally in overwintering outside,
especially if you cover them with hay or
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be just gangbusters ready
to go by the time you get out there with
[SPEAKER_02]: your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you're preventing life to be so
harsh that the biology has to completely
[SPEAKER_02]: lock itself up and then take days to come
back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that idea that all of the life in the
pot, when it dries out, gets this waxy
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior is super interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said that they make themselves
become cysts, I'm picturing all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and the mycorrhizae and the wild
variety of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, maybe all the living
things turn themselves into cysts and they
[SPEAKER_00]: make this waxy exterior so that they can
preserve themselves until the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we add water to them and some
warmth and sunshine and what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of them getting rid of this waxy
outer shell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they come out of them like we imagine a
baby chick coming out of an egg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it when enough water goes past them,
the water acts as a solvent and breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: down the waxy exterior and says,
hey, all you living forms inside these
[SPEAKER_00]: cysts, I'm going to remove your winter
coat for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your dehydration coat for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're free?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do they initiate it from within the
cyst?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great question, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, let's correct one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycorrhizae don't cyst, they sporulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They create spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're more into sexual reproduction as
far as fungal going into a suspended state
[SPEAKER_02]: of animation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the bacteria and the biology do
actually cyst or the protozoa actually do
[SPEAKER_02]: cyst up and nematode cyst as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made that correction in me,
dude, because I have been speaking in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that suggests that spores were cysts
and I didn't realize that they were not in
[SPEAKER_00]: that family.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and you know, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked about this before,
but what is occurring inside that spore?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole other universe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a universe of things that we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: How they're alive, they're too small for
us to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't understand how it's like an egg
that naturally hatches when the right
[SPEAKER_02]: environment is allowed or happens or
occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've done some neat work with my
buddy, Efren, about trying to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: more about what is going on inside of a
spore versus what's going on inside of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question on cysts,
the thought is that the organism has the
[SPEAKER_02]: components stored in what it's called
their pantry, which is part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: oreganoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go too deep on the parts
of a cell or a bacteria, but pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: it's storing the materials necessary to
create that coating around the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the real mystery is, is the water
what's eating the coating away or is the
[SPEAKER_02]: water solubilizing the coating so that the
cell can pull it back in and store it for
[SPEAKER_02]: the next time it needs it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it kind of melt away and the cell,
as it starts to come alive, starts
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducing that and stores it in his
pantry for the next time that it needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: cyst up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that science is going
to need to work on to get a better
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just something that it produces?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something that it stores or is it a
combination perhaps of both?
[SPEAKER_02]: But water definitely, water and warmth
will definitely allow that bacteria to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of cyst form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that there are folks who are
listening who now know that they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave their pots outside over winter,
but that there's probably also people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the situation that I was in last
year when I learned it from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had already put all their fabric pots
in the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is there a best practice for waking
up a pot that has gone to sporization and
[SPEAKER_00]: cystization?
[SPEAKER_01]: New words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there a best way to wake it all up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bring it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get dew, you're going to
get condensation, you're going to get cool
[SPEAKER_02]: at night, warm during the day in the
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a gentle way to wake it,
to pull it out in spring when you have
[SPEAKER_02]: your starts ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're shocking everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're shocking your plant, you're
shocking the natural order of systems in
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would just bring them out a
couple of weeks early before you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did store them and just let them
sit in the sun and don't hesitate to give
[SPEAKER_02]: them a little water, but know that at
night you're going to get dew and that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to gently wake up and then
they'll be ready for you to plant instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of trying to force the plant into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as adding the water to them to kind
of trying to help them jumpstart so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to wait for the rainwater,
do we want to just drench the hell out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we want to use just our regular
water or is this a great opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to be using a compost tea instead of a
straight water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know as I put the energy
into making a compost tea because
[SPEAKER_02]: basically it's going to run off and I
wouldn't want to overwater it because now
[SPEAKER_02]: you're washing the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, water is the ultimate solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be starting to pull
things that you want to stay in that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: system out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, if the mistake is made and
they're put into a basement or a garage or
[SPEAKER_02]: a barn, then just put them outside for a
couple of weeks before and you're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to even have to water them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not telling you not to water
them, but don't overwater them because
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're just stripping, stripping
things that you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually kind of reminds me of when I
had my surgery back in college and they
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a general anesthetic and as they
were bringing me out, they were giving me
[SPEAKER_00]: little sips of water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't giving me lots of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just getting me a little bit of
water to get my system acclimated and
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm thinking like, oh, same thing
with pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to like just drown the pot,
but go ahead and give your, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of the pot, give it a couple
drinks over the first three days to slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: prime the pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing you can do too is put
all the pots in a big square and cover
[SPEAKER_02]: them with a tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the tarp is going to do is it's going
to heat up from the sunlight and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to wick water up through the bottom
and condensate on the surface on the
[SPEAKER_02]: underside of that tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're pulling moisture up through the
bottom of the pot naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hitting it with this gentle misting
that's occurring on the inside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you've generally just,
you've used nature to evaporate and pump
[SPEAKER_02]: the water up into the pot from the bottom
and then drop it down in micro droplets
[SPEAKER_02]: from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be even better way to really
get them going if you need to quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I would squeeze one more best
practice out of you before the commercial,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you choose Saints joints,
you are smoking all flower top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints has focused on their line of
exotic curated joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saints joints goes deeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: searching out hard to find strains,
unexpected cross and nearly forgotten land
[SPEAKER_00]: races and classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some hype ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does a joint from Saints smoke
incredibly well, they have fine tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joint is just the right density to
have a nice pull and the joint stays lit
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you get a bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: out at parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints award winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art
[SPEAKER_00]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_00]: homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your budtender for Saints joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Saints joints brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow exceptional cannabis flower
but are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost and risk of launching your own brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already established in California,
Washington and Oklahoma and recognized by
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneur magazine and green
entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: leader, the Saints joints brand will set
you apart in your home market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram at Saints joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at their patented drawer design
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Instagram at Saints joints
and then visit saintsjoints.com to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of good seed makers out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, someone becomes
legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mendocino California cannabis breeder
called Mandelbrot is one of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was also known as Ra's Truth
and his cultivars are known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for the Emerald Triangle's
world famous gasoline scented terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, when it was really hard
to find quality genetics and education,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was advocating for organic
growing techniques and providing
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional seeds that would sell out as
soon as they hit the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot lived too short of a life,
dying in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while he was with us, he created
several connoisseur level cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: masterpieces like Oil Spill, The Truth and
Royal Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you approach growing cannabis
more as a toker or a breeder, you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find something that delights you in
Mandelbrot selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while some strains are better to
grow or to smoke, Mandelbrot's creations
[SPEAKER_00]: excel in every category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people keep talking about
them even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy continues the Ra's
Truth tradition by preserving these
[SPEAKER_00]: coveted genetics for future generations,
unchanged as they were originally created
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mid-2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy also creates
tasteful, modern crosses to Mandelbrot's
[SPEAKER_00]: classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines, worked by Mandelbrot's
brother Ben, further their family's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in a spirit that Mandelbrot would
have approved of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Emerald Mountain Legacy
Instagram and website to see photos of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and learn more about
Mandelbrot and his infamous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy seeds are
available online from seed banks and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors, including Labyrinth Seed
Company, The Regenerative Seed Company and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy, keeping
Mandelbrot's legacy alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In times like these, when so many cannabis
companies are growing their flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic warehouses and fields,
using synthetic nutrients, it is good to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that there are authentic California
heritage growers using natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and sunshine to cultivate
cannabis flowers for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has produced the best cannabis
in the world for generations, and the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that massively scaled industrial cannabis
production can provide the same quality as
[SPEAKER_00]: small batch, lovingly cultivated flowers
is just silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush south fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_00]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals grows under the bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature, and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is big, beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide-ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangulos, and our guest
today is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're still with us after making it
through our metaphor set where we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: all about where water comes from and what
its job is, in the second set,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about more things that
actually are going to be useful in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start by talking about
sourcing of water because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different places that you can get water of
varying qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that you
understand what your options are when
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing where to get your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Leighton, let's start talking about a
little bit about water tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know that decoding a water
test could be an entire show in and of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for most people, they know that they
should get a water test so that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in their aquifer or city water or
the rainfall near their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or their runoff or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people generally know that they should
get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also kind of have the belief that
most waters are usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like you to talk a little bit
about red flags in a water test that have
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be taken care of for you to be able
to successfully grow a cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little bit about pH as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, nice rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with the understanding of how
water moves under the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so everyone thinks, oh, I drilled a
well and I got well water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got great water.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the most cases, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have to start thinking about,
well, where I drilled my well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've basically created a opening in the
earth that allows the surface water and
[SPEAKER_02]: groundwater to travel down into the
aquifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in many ways, you've actually exposed
that aquifer to things that you weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could contaminate your own aquifer
during the drilling process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they drilled these wells in the middle
of the potato fields and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilized the hell out of the fields and
everybody got cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's just one case of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've I've actually had been fortunate
enough to work with a gentleman who does
[SPEAKER_02]: groundwater mapping for basically
superfund sites where they have these
[SPEAKER_02]: horribly toxic chemicals that are in
solution are moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water is transporting them and they're
trying to figure out how bad it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: how deep and how heavy the concentration
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he basically made an earth rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he made a rubber that is can be as long
as you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's drilled down, you know,
thousands of feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one contiguous rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what he does is he takes
this, he drills a hole and then he based
[SPEAKER_02]: on that hole, he's already prefabricated
this this rubber that he drops into the
[SPEAKER_02]: hole and fills up with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the water goes into the rubber,
it pushes it all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the cool thing is on the outside of
that rubber is a special coating that
[SPEAKER_02]: turns colors based on what chemical or
compound it comes in contact with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by drilling a series of holes,
he can see which way things are migrating
[SPEAKER_02]: or not migrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is critical because, you know,
these sites that have to be cleaned up,
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to know where where where do you
start cleaning up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which way is the water transporting these
these horrible chemicals?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you start to understand that even
water traveling uphill, this this this I
[SPEAKER_02]: love this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to Mount Lemmon in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go travel through five distinct
climates or I want to call successionary
[SPEAKER_02]: plant systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the base, you start at the bottom of
the mountain, you're in a desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hot, 110 degrees,
very little growth or plant life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drive for, you know, a couple,
not an hour, maybe 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're up into these, you know,
the big cactuses, the big three strong
[SPEAKER_02]: cactuses you see in the old westerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're heavily surrounded by them and
you've got leather cactuses and more scrub
[SPEAKER_02]: and sage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you move up into now you've got
some some shrubs, some deciduous plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and then move in a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting into now deciduous trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, at the top of Mount
Lemmon, you're in the conifers and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's snow on the ground in the middle
of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, that as the aquifer
has gone down, has dropped in levels down
[SPEAKER_02]: in the desert near Tucson and between
Tucson and Phoenix, because all the water
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been pulled out of it, it has
changed the hydrology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's the water is not seeping
out at the top of the mountain like it
[SPEAKER_02]: used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were rivers coming down this
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how the hell did the water get from the
desert where there is no water to the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of that mountain, to the point where it
created streams and rivers coming down?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's geology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the weight of the earth around it is
actually squeezing that water all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the top of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because that mountain has a thinner
layer, because of geological tectonic
[SPEAKER_02]: plate movements, the water is allowed to
squeeze out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in understanding how water moves in
aquifers and in the ground, it's critical
[SPEAKER_02]: to do your homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is my water coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another great example of this is Cape Cod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cape Cod is a sandbar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was formed back when the glaciers were
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they receded, they pushed all this,
dumped all of this glacial till out into
[SPEAKER_02]: the ocean and created Cape Cod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously there would be no aquifer
in Cape Cod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a river coming out of the
groundwater in Barnstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a big river.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my good friends, Keith Wilda,
where I collect my fish frass from the
[SPEAKER_02]: oldest trout farm in America, that trout
farm was set up in that spot because of
[SPEAKER_02]: how incredibly pure that water was and how
much of it was just bubbling up out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you walk around his property and
you can see water bubbling up out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the million dollar question is,
is it fresh?
[SPEAKER_02]: The water actually comes from Canada,
North New York and parts of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually, believe it or not,
it's wonderful water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing is it's high in
nitrite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd have to get along back to aquatic
biology and understanding how organic
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen, organic nitrogen is not in the
usable form, but with the introduction of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria, specifically nitrobacter,
it'll convert it to ammonia and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: ammonia converts to nitrite and then the
nitrite converts to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now nitrate is harmless to plants and
animals and we can actually use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas nitrite can be toxic in heavy
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, he's got all of the aquatic
organisms because he's an aquaculture
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows a tremendous amount of biomass of
trout so that he naturally has the
[SPEAKER_02]: protection against the nitrites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after his post-water treated,
the nitrites are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been completely morphed into
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's actually doing the water test
system a favor by cleaning it with his
[SPEAKER_02]: fish before it's released into the streams
and into the swamps around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leighton, let's bring this on back home
to the water tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when you started this
super interesting story, I think you were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with you got to know where your
water's from for your water tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that the earth was pressing
down on the groundwater enough to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: go up the mountain and flow down,
that's super badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the chemicals that if somebody
sees in their water test coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their aquifer that they should raise a
flag and go, oh, this may not be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: place for me to cultivate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cannabis is an accumulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that's being transported in
the water will accumulate in your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So backing it up, most water tests are
designed to sell you filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really need to know where you're
sending your water test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend Micro Macro International.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gretchen and her crew of scientists are
there to actually test for minerals or
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides, residues, and toxics,
heavy metals, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most water companies or places that you
send for your water test, short of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that the well companies work with,
I don't recommend you send it to them
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're going to send some guy out
there to sell you a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not finding the toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are too expensive to test for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people don't test for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well water is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's considered a potable water,
they're a little bit tighter on making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that they are testing a more
stringent test.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you really want to know what the
heck's going on, you send it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: someone like Macro Micro Gretchen and
she'll tell you exactly what's going in
[SPEAKER_02]: your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you have to think about where
is that water coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're south of an industrial park or
potentially the water is coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of states and counties have done
groundwater migration studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very expensive to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially around polluted areas,
they've been forced to map the
[SPEAKER_02]: groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would recommend that you reach out to
your local authority and try to find out,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, did anybody map the groundwater?
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the groundwater is just as
important as the aquifer itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the groundwater, because it's
traveling by a pipe that someone drilled a
[SPEAKER_02]: hole in down to get down to the aquifer,
they were letting all of that potential
[SPEAKER_02]: toxins down in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they might not be getting as much of
it because as that water migrates down
[SPEAKER_02]: that shaft, there is a current in that
aquifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be transporting those toxins
away from their pump when they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, when they're pulling water,
they're going to get a little bit of it up
[SPEAKER_02]: the pipe that they're drinking out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, anything that's
coming down the sides of that shaft are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get pushed into the current.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine you throw a tennis ball in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, is the ball getting pulled out with
the tide or is it getting pushed up
[SPEAKER_02]: against the shore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing is happening on the groundwater
level as well as the aquifer level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really got to know your business as
far as if you're going to rely on the well
[SPEAKER_02]: to water your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a industrial area like down
in LA or San Francisco or San Diego,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would almost tend to say you're better
off to use town water and tie up the
[SPEAKER_02]: chloramine than you are to trust the well,
unless you've done your homework and or
[SPEAKER_02]: sent it off to get a real hardcore water
test and analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hold off on the chloramine
discussion for a sec because we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'm starting to kind of like tease
out three different threads here as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: like how we would be using the water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far, we've been kind of discussing
the kind of research you're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do before you buy a parcel to grow
either either THC cannabis or hemp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to be growing cannabis
sativa, do your homework about how the
[SPEAKER_00]: water moves and where the water is moving
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you buy your parcel, because
cannabis is an accumulator and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: end up growing plants that have got,
you know, arsenic or something in them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so do your homework first before you
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then then there's a second thread,
which is lots of folks who are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: either commercial or for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they're already on their parcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, chances are a lot of
these people would already know if their
[SPEAKER_00]: water was contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they they already know that their
water is good enough to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then there's the third
category, which are people who are on city
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, unless you are,
you know, living in kind of like a failed
[SPEAKER_00]: water system like a Flint, Michigan or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I would think that most of the
city waters are, you know, while while
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not epically good, they're at least
passable for pouring onto our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then that kind of leaves the the
bugaboo of pH, because any three of those
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, you could be dealing with
water that pH is poorly for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so address that specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know that like there's so lots of
products on the market to pH up or pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down, which are like, you know,
I generally consider them a hassle to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to equalize, you know, all the all the
water that I'm going to be offering the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far away from optimum is too far to be
doing that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just need to find a different
source like like how far from optimum is
[SPEAKER_00]: too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scale pH is logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you have a pH of six, six one is 10
times greater than six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six two is now 10 times greater than six
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like huge differences between six
and eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's monumental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight is considered too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too alkaline for plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some some some some plants that
can get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pete, for one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, it's the majority.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of plants cannot tolerate pH
above eight or below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like four or five,
four point five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, there are some plants that can
tolerate that, but they're few and far
[SPEAKER_02]: between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vast majority of plants we want to
keep in that neutral zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where they're going to do
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, another thing to take into
consideration is that the plant can adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: pH in the Riosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this because the plant will
excrete and exudate certain type of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria will grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that bacteria is job is to mine this
mineral or that mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be slightly off of the pH
that the plant or the soil has present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by adjusting the specific bacteria that
it wants to grow out, it can adjust the pH
[SPEAKER_02]: to allow that mineral to be mined and
brought back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through through the nutrient cycling
system, the protozoa eating the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are your outside parameters of pH
and that will allow a plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also something to take into
consideration is as you pour that water on
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil and that water moves through the
soil, you're adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a tremendous amount of work with
people that have high pH soils or low pH
[SPEAKER_02]: soils, and they need to get them adjusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I generally do that is with
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can get compost that's more
acid or more base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just tell them, all right,
you know, you're going to have to either
[SPEAKER_02]: till this in or you're going to have to
dig a hole and then blend the existing
[SPEAKER_02]: soil with this compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will equal out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like if you take a soil
system of six and a compost of eight and
[SPEAKER_02]: you mix them 50 50 equally, you will end
up with a pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that works because of these because
these numbers are logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as as far as the the water
systems are concerned, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_02]: city waters are safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are forced to test for heavy metals
and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one place that they get a little bit
problematic is that nitrogen cycle where
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the ammonia that they use to mix
with chloramine or chlorine and ammonia
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed together make chloramine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a high level of nitrogen,
nitrogen, nitrobacter or nitrogen fixing
[SPEAKER_02]: biology, you're going to start that
process of breaking that organic matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: say the little tiny leaf or, you know,
something that got pulled into the pipe
[SPEAKER_02]: from the reservoir that is going to
actually start to morph out, start to pull
[SPEAKER_02]: off the ammonia, leave the chlorine in
place and then convert the ammonia to
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrite and then to nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really depends on where you are in the
pipeline and to how long or what level of
[SPEAKER_02]: biology got into the system to determine,
you know, whether you're drinking nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: water or nitrate water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's the only concern I have
with with city water for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, human consumption will get that's
another hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue talking about city
water, because that's where I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move to next anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of not one of the number
one question that I get from people about
[SPEAKER_00]: their city water is how to take out the
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally I have to explain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, well, the chlorine is is
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take the you pour your water and
leave it out overnight and the chlorine
[SPEAKER_00]: off gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to do it more quickly,
you can stir it for a bit or you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbler in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chloramine, it's it's volatile and
it goes away very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also have to tell them,
I'm like, man, they don't really use
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine as much in public waterworks
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using chloramine instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we're not able to just
mix that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not as volatile and it stays in
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like you to go ahead and repeat
the great solution that you offered us
[SPEAKER_00]: last time on on how to neutralize the
chloramine in your city water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I did want to back up on
one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when you're using town
water or not town water, well water for
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding your cannabis plants and then you
test your cannabis plant because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to or you have to on a commercial
scale, that cannabis plant is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you if your water is bad or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you understand that you didn't
put anything else into your system and the
[SPEAKER_02]: water was the only input that you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means, you know, if you're growing
with mineral salts or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: the toxins could have come in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really now you have to test all
these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're you know, again,
it's this is more important in a suburbia
[SPEAKER_02]: urban environment than it is in a rural
environment, rural environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have to worry about
your water as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if if you did use a hemp plant to test
your water, I think it's a great idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you're just using water only,
that plant's going to tell you if your
[SPEAKER_02]: water is toxic or not, because it's going
to fail a test for a metal or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, moving on to tying up
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chloramine is is basically chlorine and
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can and ammonia gas is off
really easy and chlorine gas is off really
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you have to do is break it,
break the bond because chloramine is an
[SPEAKER_02]: ionic bond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really, really strong one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much the only thing that can do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, electrolysis can, but but more
importantly, biology can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biology does everything, which we know
we've talked about that in the last show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you introduce a humate or a humic
acid or even even a good compost tea
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been concentrated, what that's
going to do is that's going to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and it's going to break that
molecule apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through aeration, it will gas off
and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other than sometimes you can have
what's called a disinfectant byproduct,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those will not hurt plants,
but they are harmful to animals and
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get to the nitty gritty of it,
somebody who wants to add some humates to
[SPEAKER_00]: their water, it's as simple as just taking
some matured compost that you may have and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in, you know, an old nylon or
cheesecloth, tying it off and and just
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping it into your water reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to take it a little bit different
path because you really want to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: humic acid out of that compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would take the compost, I would
saturate it, get it really wet and then
[SPEAKER_02]: put it inside of, say, an old washcloth or
a towel and then dump it on the towel and
[SPEAKER_02]: then wring the towel out as hard as you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're getting pure humic and pure
folic acid concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you put the bag in the bucket,
put it in the bubbler and brew it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to get that fast of a
release of the things that you really
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pressure and squeezing really helps to
get what you're looking for out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: compost as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then add that into your brewer and brew
your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the key, again, is you need to brew
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to move air up through the water
column to help break off any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leftover gases that are trapped in the
water away from your out of your water
[SPEAKER_02]: column and into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little trick for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm not the only one who's
weighed this in my head in my early years
[SPEAKER_00]: of personal growing for my medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, oh, my God, trying to add
compost tea to my water and bubble it in
[SPEAKER_00]: my apartment is such a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so will you give us the real breakdown
of how necessary it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many people in cannabis forums,
they are totalitarian, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, you know, you must do everything
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when it comes to us alone
with nobody around in our garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very often people will cut
corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad is it really to use your city
water with chloramine to water your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, clearly it doesn't kill them
because people are growing plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: city waters untreated all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we actually losing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're losing the microbial life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we know that when these things
come in contact with biology and not all
[SPEAKER_02]: of them, you know, this was this was the
work I did back at Rodale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would bring in some some city water
that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was on the end of a pipe and it was
I mean, the chlorine was just so brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just burned your eyes when you poured a
glass of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought that down to try to do side
by side tests at different dilutions to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine, you know, what is killing the
biology?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely seriously reduces the
biology, not all of it, but especially the
[SPEAKER_02]: predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take they take the big hit and fungi
takes a big hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacteria, most of it can survive,
but you're going to lose diversity for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how bad is it to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine if you're using salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a living soil system,
you got a problem because you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to constantly need to up the
biology life in that soil because you use
[SPEAKER_02]: that chloramine water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like you're just watering at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, every day or every
other day, you're hitting it with more
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine and more chloramine and more
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so even if you are only killing 10
percent of the biology when you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you kill a varying 10 percent,
throughout the entire summer or throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: your entire cycle, if you're in a tent,
well, you know, you're losing a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant is living unsupported from the
proper biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're where you're losing it is you're
losing potency, cannabinoid production,
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene production, cannabinol production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's where you're that's
where you're losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to you're still going
to get some good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to be able to get high
off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to be getting what we
call plant potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're looking for plant potential,
you really want to get that plant to give
[SPEAKER_02]: you everything that it wants to give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you shouldn't be using chloramine
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should figure out another way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can boil it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but now you're concentrating fluoride.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use, you know, go down and buy
bottled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably your easiest way out of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, based on years of
experience traveling the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at people's compost and having
them say, oh, my God, I make the best
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: My compost is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I microscope it and there's no life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, it's nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not knocking your compost,
but you didn't make it biologically
[SPEAKER_02]: active.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to make a compost tea,
your goal is to try to get the biology
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil with the tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tea is the vehicle for getting living
biology, advanced predators into your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're brewing with compost that
has no biology in it, what are you really
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're getting humic acid and fulvic
acid, but you're not increasing the
[SPEAKER_02]: biological level in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that's where it gets hairy
when when you try to talk about hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: full plant potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where, you know, you need a
microscope or, you know, a trusted soil
[SPEAKER_02]: food web source for getting your microbes
tested so you know where you are having
[SPEAKER_02]: your compost tested to make sure that you
actually have biologically rich compost
[SPEAKER_02]: before you try to make a tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: With it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, all these things are need to
be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if if your goal is just to grow
something to smoke and you're happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the plant can produce,
then don't stress about all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, life goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is an amazing, durable,
strong, unique plant and can survive in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the most harsh conditions on the
planet can throw at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, again, I think you need to
draw a line and say, am I going for full
[SPEAKER_02]: plant potential?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want the best this can possibly do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got to get serious about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just trying to grow and I don't
have time for all of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these intricacies, then I'm just going to
just add the water and don't stress or or
[SPEAKER_02]: use town use bottled water because you
know, you're not it's not you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: need, you know, 100 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get five gallon jug is probably
enough to water your 10 plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for at least a month,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then you can just go and
refill that bottled water up at your local
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like here in Seattle,
you know, I live on Vashon Island across
[SPEAKER_00]: the water from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the the Seattle Aquarium actually
sells their reverse osmosis water out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: little spigot on the side of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to use it all the time when I was
into breeding fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so that was that was cool to be
able to get it very cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I point that out is,
you know, we don't really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage people to use bottled water as
like buying a new bottle every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should have been more specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about those ones,
those big jugs that you can do exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring them back to the machine,
you stick them in there and it fills it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but another thing I do want to mention
is that reverse osmosis, as great as it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, it has demineralized the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not particularly good water to
grow cannabis or anything else to consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the studies that are coming out of
the Middle East right now, because
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is desalinated over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a huge iodine deficiencies in the
humans in the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're getting very sick because
they've been drinking this stuff for years
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no minerals left in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd prefer you use spring water over RO
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're going to use RO water,
you've got to read the minerals back into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like RO water is not a whole food.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it has its purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, and people do drink it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, in most sailboats,
they have a little RO underneath the sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's their source of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you live on that water,
you are stripping minerals out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, this water is the
ultimate universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will actually, if it has no minerals
in it and it's stripped and you drink it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will pull minerals out of your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your water to be mineralized.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very important for consumption and
for plants, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's better that you're giving
them those trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go on to our third of four
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about city water and we talked
about aquifer water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you are particularly a nerd
for water harvesting, as am I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really only ever think about rainwater
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I heard you talk about it and you
start ticking off the list of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different places water can be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wade into that, pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are good sources for capturing
water, wild crafting water?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going back into the deep end
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most people would be able to identify a
wet spot on their land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be at the top of the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be at the bottom of the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be, you know, a little bog or an
area where the soil is always moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that is, is that's a artesian well or
a groundwater source that the water is
[SPEAKER_02]: oozing out of the rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are one of the areas that I would
I love to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I'm scouting a client's property,
which is the first thing I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always looking for the wet spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can say, OK, we have we have a
good source of water that we want to now
[SPEAKER_02]: direct and manage and harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one place I love rainwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, one of the coolest things
is seeing all these satellite images of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in the atmosphere during
this coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was horrified to see how
bad the air pollution was in the
[SPEAKER_02]: tri-state, which is New York, Connecticut
and New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that air was generally moving
northeast up the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we all have talked about
acid rain, you know, back 20, 30 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, but no one talks about it now because
it's not a popular topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I was in a situation where I wanted
to collect rainwater in my old state of
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts or Connecticut, I would be a
little bit more concerned about making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that I filtered it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by filtering it, I meant I mean that I
would want to run it through other
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulator plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hemp is a great one, but there's
plenty of other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of aquatic plants that
do accumulation or that clean the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that so there's a little bit of a
different spin that if you should know
[SPEAKER_02]: your atmosphere, you know, like the smog
coming out of L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing up into the valley, like I would
not want to harvest water up there without
[SPEAKER_02]: purifying it or having the having the
water have a time to to go through the
[SPEAKER_02]: root systems of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would are known to clean the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are two sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is that when
collecting rainwater, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these cisterns outside people's
houses and all the gutters go in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem with that is you've
collected the rainwater during the time
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to run out of it real
quick when you start using it and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: raining anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So beyond that, I set up your cistern for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bigger the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where the water comes out of your
cistern when it's full, that's where you
[SPEAKER_02]: really want to get serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you want to have a swale going through
your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously you got to take
topography into consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're perfectly flat, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a slight pitch to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to get out there with a
laser level or a hand level and figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: where that pitch is and build a swale and
battery at a bio swale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you so you dig a gentle channel and you
fill it with chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've covered with a little bit
of dirt and then you plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what those chips do is they slowly
suck all that water up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during during the rainy season,
and then as the as the rain stops coming
[SPEAKER_02]: and the soil starts to dry out,
they wick that back into the soil system
[SPEAKER_02]: like we talked about earlier on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, one of the coolest things
that I've worked on was where we dug a
[SPEAKER_02]: well, a groundwater well to see how deep
the groundwater was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a big fan of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found that we found the lowest point
of the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: We dug a groundwater well, lined it with
stones, went down till till we hit
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture till we hit, you know,
oozing water, then dug another couple feet
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, lined it all with stone and
then watched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could watch the groundwater going
up and down during different seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after we installed all of this water
harvesting, you know, these swales and
[SPEAKER_02]: smiles, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is going to be hard to describe
without a drawing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically raised the groundwater
because as the groundwater went down
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally due to lack of rain,
now all of a sudden, all that water that
[SPEAKER_02]: was being stored in those bioswales was
slowly being let back into the soil system
[SPEAKER_02]: and accumulating in the well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the coolest part about it was it's
like we could pump water out of that well
[SPEAKER_02]: to do emergency watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually forced more water to
come back into the well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a combination of managing your
soil system, putting as much carbon as you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can into it to hold the moisture
so that when you're desperately needing
[SPEAKER_02]: the summer, it's slowly leaching out and
going back into either your well so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can monitor it or just knowing that it's
naturally leaching out into your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you kind of like get
smart and you build this bioswale right
[SPEAKER_02]: through the middle of your field so that
you know that the plants on the left and
[SPEAKER_02]: the right of it are getting the moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually think of like a river
and creating all these different forks
[SPEAKER_02]: coming off of it so that you're getting
these water storage units in the soil in
[SPEAKER_02]: the form of a carbon, an old chip or
cardboard or paper, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you're planting the top of it
so that evaporation cannot happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't store water in an open pond because
you're going to lose it during the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to store it underground,
under cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see such a big difference in
the amount of watering that you actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do that you'll realize,
oh my God, I should have done this years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say store it underwater,
do you mean in big plastic reservoirs?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I meant underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a lining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just basically need to dig a swale,
fill it with chips, take the leftover
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt, spread it on the top a couple of
inches and then plant it with a cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, a ground cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is that prevents that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you just put the chips in and you
dump the water into those chips,
[SPEAKER_02]: the air, the wind and the sun would
naturally wick that water out and
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by covering it, putting it underground,
under soil and then cover cropping that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil so that the soil doesn't blow off in
a road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also again, the soil could wick the
moisture out of the chips and up out into
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have ground cover to protect
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the way that you access that water for
your plants by planting your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, basically what you're doing is you're
thinking along the lines of wicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you're storing the water
there, but that water is being wicked out
[SPEAKER_02]: laterally, horizontally, upwards,
even up gradients as necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically, you're, you're,
you're concentrating the water in one
[SPEAKER_02]: spot, knowing that it's going to wick out
and spread out in a greater area than
[SPEAKER_02]: where the water is concentrated at that
point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That a little bit depends on your soil
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in a clay soil, it's not going
to wick as fast in a sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it's going to work a lot
quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some other considerations to
think about, but what it's doing is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: raising the moisture level in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's, you know, you're,
you're using it to surface water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just allowing the roots to have
greater access to subsurface water and
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas a pond, you can actually siphon
the water out of the pond with the hose
[SPEAKER_00]: and pointed at your pots or your drip
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about, we want to capture
and keep as much of the water on our
[SPEAKER_00]: parcel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the soil to do the work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I love, I love the guys that
have those water tanks uphill and they
[SPEAKER_02]: use, you know, obviously gravity to,
to water your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the same idea, except for it's
the soil now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil is actually, because you dug
the swale, you put all those chips in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when your cistern overflowed,
it overflowed into that swale and that
[SPEAKER_02]: swale slowly, the water moved down by
gravity to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, all those chips got what we
call field capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got as wet as they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they've held all of that moisture
there for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that as, as the ground dries out around
it, because there's no longer rain coming
[SPEAKER_02]: down, the ground around it is now pulling
that water out of that bioswale and
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting a moisture level that it needs
for, for the plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually saw that a great example of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, was the beginning of last summer or
the summer before, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: at ladies sativa farm in Humboldt,
they, they live at the top of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most of us go through a
drought season and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, during the rainy season,
we have to capture as much of this water
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the top of the mountain because
it's really wants to go down the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, they, they, you know,
they use swales and ponds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a whole variety of, um,
of techniques that we actually go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the, with the interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, with Rio from ladies sativa that's on
the YouTube channel that you can check out
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, um, you know, his goal,
like, yeah, he's a, he's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, but he's all like, man,
he says, I spend more of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestering water and growing cover crops
and, and, and making the water work to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave my property as much as he's growing
cannabis, which I found really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, um, let's, let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other category of folks, because
certainly in the regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, which we love so much, there's a
lot of these permaculture techniques that
[SPEAKER_00]: have made their way into the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people aren't just directly pumping the
aquifer, but let's answer this question in
[SPEAKER_00]: another way for folks who are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just growing there, you know,
there's six personal plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available in a lot of states up to like
the 15 that are available in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: states for medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you don't have property,
if you're not trying to sequester all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this water on your acreage and you just
don't want to use your city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I recognize that we have to be a
little bit aware of where our rainwater is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from and what it's made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, especially if we live in an
industrial city, what would you consider
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a, a simple and effective way to
capture rainwater cleanly?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just to be, just to be working
on your six or 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, again, one of the things that I
said earlier about capturing rainwater,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I was in one of those industrial zones
or in a city, um, I would want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: running that water through, you know,
some mosses or some other plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually do clean the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm making it too complicated for
these guys because now I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, yeah, capture, capture the water off
the gutters, um, but then take it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to store it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most people literally are,
are taking it off the roof or they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a big tarp and they're funneling it into a
rain barrel and they, they've got a rain
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel with a spout and then they fill up
their watering can with that and they go
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say that's the default
setting for most people, small cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and capturing rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what do you think of that setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like, do you, to what degree do
you need to add this step where you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it through some grasses or
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, again, it's now we're hitting,
you know, we're, we're dividing the hair
[SPEAKER_02]: between full plant potential and just
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it, you know, if you want to go to
the next level, then that's what I would
[SPEAKER_02]: do is I would look at, you know,
these different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you can do is get the old
canary in the coal mine, throw a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: goldfish in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if these goldfish die, you know,
you've got a problem, but if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: thriving and living, then you're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that might be a quick,
easy way for, um, people to know that the
[SPEAKER_02]: water that they're using or collecting,
uh, harvesting is safe because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the, the canary in the coal
mine, if the goldfish dies, you got a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that the goldfish would do
too, is if you feed it, um, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make some poop for you, which is
aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple of birds with one stone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hey, let's go ahead and take our
second commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you are listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is soil biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all around good guy, late Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U S at
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a bio-stimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyke.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O dot com.

[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, you are listening to Shaping
Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lose and our guest
today is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the last set, we are gonna be
talking about best practices for watering
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, for something that seems
so simple, there are a lot of ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leighton, what factors determine how
much to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a lot of folks, we kinda just
think well, you know, let's just drench
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell out of it and then that way I
know that it won't dry out before the next
[SPEAKER_00]: time I come back to my pot, but that's not
very strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaning on the biological knowledge,
what's the actual way for us to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how much to water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the plant, it'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the sun leaves are tracking the sun or
the lights in your tent and praying to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the moisture is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're drooping, that usually
means that they're either lacking moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: or they have too much moisture and
overwatering definitely moves soil
[SPEAKER_02]: particles down into the profile as well as
washes out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a big fan of those blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can regulate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture meters are helpful, but
eventually you'll get used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just be able to stick your finger
in there and if you can feel it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll know you're in a good place and if
your plants praying to the sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you're in the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah man, there's nothing quite like when
the plants are praying and they're all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, up, they're reaching and they're
tracking the sun or the light and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got that slight inverted taco look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see that, I'm just, I like give
myself a little pat on the back and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: all like, thank God I'm doing it right
today, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant tells you everything you need to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gotta learn how to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the factors that are
going to play a role in how much we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming heat and humidity are gonna
play a big role.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should we think about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity is a huge role because if it's
too dry, if it's the winter and you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: your heat on and your HVAC system is
pushing heat all over the place,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's gonna dry out and that's where
I recommend if you're in a tent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get one of those little tiny
humidifiers, they're inexpensive and it
[SPEAKER_02]: will help to put moisture into the air and
you won't have to water nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great way of preventing the
soil from wicking the moisture out and
[SPEAKER_02]: letting the air out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull it out because you guys all have fans
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to move the air around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when that wind is blowing across the
pot, it is pulling moisture out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that humidifier is a great trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of no soil left bare so that
those leaves are covering up every square
[SPEAKER_02]: inch of that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you'll notice when you flip the
leaves over and look at the underside,
[SPEAKER_02]: there'll be a little condensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's preventing that moisture from
escaping from the surface of that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great way to prevent excess watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's good for us to point out
momentarily, cover crops do not steal
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from your pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they do not and they build miles of
Riosphere which crosses the roots of your
[SPEAKER_02]: other cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of wonderful exchanges
that are happening there as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting extra protozoa,
extra bacteria that are all functioning
[SPEAKER_02]: for you at a high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not stealing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually adding them back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of us are slowly but surely
converting over to fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of reasons why black
plastic pots are questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from the fact that they're
plastic to the fact that they tend to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little sludgy at the bottom if people
don't have rocks in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good reasons to go to the
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got companies like
Grassroots that are actually lining the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the fabric pots so they lose
less air out the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your experience, Layton,
do we need to water fabric pots more
[SPEAKER_00]: often?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they definitely leach out
moisture out the sides of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if you're in a plastic pot,
the only area you have to be concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: about is the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a fabric pot, you got the sides as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I always say, you need some
kind of vapor barrier to prevent that
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to hear that the pot companies are
actually taking that into consideration
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the past, when you see these,
the sides of the pots would go
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd pour the water on the top,
it would run right over the sides and
[SPEAKER_02]: right down the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you couldn't get the moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you talked about that last time about
how you saw a huge difference with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you can't cover crop the side of your
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do things like put hay bales
against them, foam if you have extra foam,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you prevent that water or the air
from stealing the moisture out of the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the sides of that pot to get
warm, because that's going to directly
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by insulating it and putting a vapor
barrier in on the sides of your pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be able to use those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a big fan of those fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm actually really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling these living soil fabric
pots from grassroots pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent me out a couple to
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm actually trialing their pots,
but then also their fabric beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got liners on those too,
because they're like, hey, we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're losing water out the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fabric pots are not necessarily as
effective as pushing the water down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the pot, because so often it
just evaporates out the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, there's a lot of people who
have used them, because these have been
[SPEAKER_00]: out for a year or two already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting around to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you more of my thoughts in
the fall on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, so let's next talk about
hydrophobic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can cop to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not even realize what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: in my pots until I heard you speak at the
Michigan Regen event, because I just know
[SPEAKER_00]: that so many people are going to like,
oh, shit, that happens to me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hand water my pot and I would
watch the water bead slide across the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the pot and then go down the
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the water to go into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it was going a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sliding off as if the soil was
a solid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was after listening to you and Dr.
Elaine Ingham that I realized that I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to add a cover crop to create all
of these opportunities for the water to go
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I don't have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there's people who are
listening who have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and hit on what makes a pot go
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming you're going to,
but talk crap about peat moss too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know how much I hate peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been blessed to have worked with
a company called Pit Moss back 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago or so in trying to develop a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mott Hadley was grinding up newspapers
because he saw his grandmother use
[SPEAKER_02]: newspapers to line her soil in her outdoor
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he realized, well, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a great moisture holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I shredded it, maybe I could get away
from using peat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started this company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the years, he's gone ups and
downs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, just recently, a group has
come in and really started to grab this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing by the horns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're developing some wonderful
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm beta testing a bunch of them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually working with them on
formulating one specifically for living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil systems, which I'm really excited
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be core.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, they've got a great
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great source of clean core ground
up paper pulp, cardboard pulp,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is an amazing fungal food.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biology that I've seen in so far and
the products that they've sent me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I either see a tremendous amount of spores
or I see a tremendous amount of hyphae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine being able to buy a soil
that was loaded with hyphae out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: gate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a jumpstart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's funny too is pit moss has
reached out to me as well to send me stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because they heard through the grapevine
that I talk a lot of crap about taking pit
[SPEAKER_00]: moss out of the environment because it's
not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here that they've reached out to
you, somebody over there is doing a good
[SPEAKER_00]: job of reaching out to folks like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I give Ashley a lot of credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, Ashley's the one who reached out
to me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she heard me on a podcast and hit me
up because I was bashing pit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ecstatic to be back in touch with them
and back in doing some trials to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're performing and how we could
formulate better ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is hydrophobic soil and how does it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So hydrophobic is basically that you have
organic matter, which is what the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the outside of that organic matter is
completely coated with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those bacteria go back into that cyst
form as they dry out and they create that
[SPEAKER_02]: wax surface, which doesn't allow the water
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a situation where I have a
hydrophobic pot, I don't have cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take a wet towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a towel soaking wet and then I cover
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that that water slowly wicked out
of the towel and wicked back into the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would be the way to quickly,
as quick as possible, take the hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_02]: component out of the surface of that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the interesting thing is with pit
moss, it has a similar side effect that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed in my starts, that it does go
a little bit hydrophobic on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you break through it,
you could feel that it's nice and moist
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, all right, how do we prevent
the soil from going hydrophobic on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I explained to them the
reasons why we're playing with a organic
[SPEAKER_02]: based wetting agent that's going to
prevent it from happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, again, we need some more
time to really get these kinks out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product development aside, though,
we have the answer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's you've got to have a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like whether it's,
you know, whether it's grasses or clovers
[SPEAKER_00]: or radishes or, you know, the build a soil
like cover crop mix or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of really great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is you've got to grow other
stuff in your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocultures are not natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are still people, there's
holdouts that don't want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to have to fuss with the with
the other crops because they can
[SPEAKER_02]: inadvertently become bankers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banker plants are not banker plants,
but trap plants and bring in other pests
[SPEAKER_02]: into your your atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you definitely need to choose your
cover crops carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that that part is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you know, if you're in a
situation where you don't want to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with cover crop, just get an old towel
soaking wet and, you know, put that around
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the pot so that so that it
holds the moisture in and that will
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent that hydrophobic problem in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you what causes the pot to go
hydrophobic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like what is the thing that people
need to not do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about solving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about using the cover crop
and we've talked about putting the blanket
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we can even like,
say me, for example, what did I do to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the top layer to go cystic and and
have that waxy top?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I do wrong that caused it other
than just not having a cover crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity and sun, humidity, sun and wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's causing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When when when the wind blows across soil,
the amount of moisture that it pulls out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that soil is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to do these monster
landscapes, you know, for these
[SPEAKER_02]: billionaires.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we'd be working right
straight through whatever season it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd always get like if we got to
spring, you know, mud season, it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: nightmare to try to spread soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would have to be so careful to have
the blender not blend it when there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: rainstorm coming or or even in some cases,
not try to spread it on on the surface of
[SPEAKER_02]: the of the existing soil until the wind
came in and dried it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd shut the job down a number of
times because of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the builder would freak, the owner
would freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, look, you guys,
if I don't do this, I'm going to turn this
[SPEAKER_02]: into a mud bath.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're really going to have a
problem because everything is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: rutted and you're going to be killing
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that moist, that wind going across
the top of that soil surface is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second would be the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, lastly, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do not have a relative humidity
meter in your tent or in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you never know how how much moisture
is being stolen off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of that pot because of lack of humidity in
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those those are the three reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wind sun or or relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much does it matter the temperature
of the water when we water the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're in a greenhouse,
I would just let it sit out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse before I used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a tent, you know,
you're probably at 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to shock anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if you poured cold water on your
plant, it's not going to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you pour boiling water on it,
your plants not going to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to have that water as close to
the temperature of the soil as you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's a that was a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any advantage to bubbling the
water first to air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some people do that to get rid
of, you know, the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that other folks do it because
they're actually going to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put some compost tea into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also know some people that do
it because they're like, oh, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take more oxygen down to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to bubble my water to extra
aerated before I put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's scientifically
sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can build a dissolved oxygen in a
water column through aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you do it in a fish tank,
because the fish, you know, I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into biology again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the breakdown of those, you know,
the nitrogen cycle is creating CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the only way to get the CO2
dissolved oxygen level up high enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the fish life, depending on the
amount of biomass, obviously, the more
[SPEAKER_02]: fish, the more bubblers, the more air
stones you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, I'm a huge fan of bubbling the
water first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then applying it because yes,
you are bringing down a higher level of
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolved oxygen into the soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I touched on this last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't experiment way back when where I
measured dissolved oxygen in a raindrop in
[SPEAKER_02]: a sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of those rotary sprinklers that
come out of the ground and go and water in
[SPEAKER_02]: a pipe and then water in a drip irrigation
tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dissolved oxygen level in the raindrop
was 23 parts per million in the sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 15 out of the faucet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end of the drip irrigation
pipe, it was six anaerobic, six,
[SPEAKER_02]: five to six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know you can build that water
molecule up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a there's a great video
showing what happens to a water droplet as
[SPEAKER_02]: it travels through the atmosphere and it
rolls over on itself like a donut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's constantly pulling in the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it's tumbling through the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely aerate your water if you
possibly can, because that will help to
[SPEAKER_02]: support the life in the soil, especially
if you have a really good living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: system and you don't have earthworms or a
way for that soil to really build the
[SPEAKER_02]: tilth out of the gate, then bubble your
water so that you're helped to feed those
[SPEAKER_02]: those organisms that extra oxygen so they
can in turn build that tilth and allow
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil to respirate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about method of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, everybody said I
shouldn't say everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a certain contingent in the home
growing scene that demands hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I and you know, some of that is
because of the effect of the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hand watering and just giving the plant as
much as it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think a lot of it is that
people like me who believe that a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: thrives more when you spend a little time
with it every day and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're more aware of your pest pressure
and, you know, changing color of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: that might show that you might be missing
some nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of that comes with the moment that
you spent with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also, you know, while while I have
not used blue mat yet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends are saying great things about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you scale up, it's much,
much difficult, much more difficult to do
[SPEAKER_00]: hand watering and people shift up to
commercial scale drip lines and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there really a difference to the plant
which one you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this really simply economies of
scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and how this impacts your labor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it really matter to the plant what we
which one we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem with hand watering is the
inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you sit in there counting each
plant, how long it you took to water it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then some are going to get a little bit
extra water and some are going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: little less water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the concept of being, you know,
out there with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a big proponent of being a farmer
shadow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you guys need to be in with your
plants all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are the extremists that say,
oh, just leave the plant alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the plant do its work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in in a monocropping situation,
you're asking for problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're if you're highly regen
and you've got all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and diversity around your cannabis,
you're going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have the kind of pest
pressure that can happen with a
[SPEAKER_02]: monocropping system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that the hand watering comes
in because it's forcing you to spend time
[SPEAKER_02]: with each and every one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to be careful because
humans are humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you start daydreaming for a minute
and lose your count, well, now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to overwater or underwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's it's a matter of being
more diligent in spending your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case, the reason I love the
blue mats are is because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: non-mechanical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the only thing that's driving it is
that ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that ceramic gets to a certain level
of moisture, it either calls for more
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture or it shuts off and prevents more
moisture from coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a brainless way of maintaining a
certain soil moisture level that's unique
[SPEAKER_02]: to anything I've ever seen on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm a big fan of it,
because it takes the guesswork out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be good in the category of
guesswork.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just said if you get distracted and
you lose your count when you're hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, dude, I don't even have a count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even think about that as,
you know, I hand water and I'm watching it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like, man, looks about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, oh,
my God, no wonder I've got watering issues
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so how do you come to a water?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you come to account?
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you got to start with obviously
sticking your finger in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not good, if you're not good
enough at that yet, another trick is to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a handful of the soil and squeeze it
as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get water dropping out of it,
it's too much water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to just get a little
bit of a slick spot at the bottom where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're squeezing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it shouldn't drip out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should obviously it should hold
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't just, you know, crumble or
expand back to its original size very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great way of determining the
moisture content of where your sweet spot
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as as hand watering,
that, again, depends on your soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're all potting soil or we call it
the soil is medium, that's going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: more moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, problem is the surface is going
to go hydrophobic and the internal is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I push that a horizon is so
critical in this and that a horizon is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to help you maintain an equal
moisture profile from the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot to the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, it depends on your soil matrix
as to, you know, what the count might look
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty easy to, you know,
once you start to realize what the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture should feel like, you'll get
comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to just walk up,
stick your finger in the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this one needs a little moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, another thing,
too, is that these plants are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: react differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: One might transfer rate based on the
cultivar differently than another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of them are used to a
higher tolerance of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are less.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the cultivars are also going to
drive, you know, what that moisture level
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But start with that squeezing trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually move into that being
able to just stick your finger in there
[SPEAKER_02]: until you feel that that moisture level
and you'll get comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think what I'm going to do is I
think I'll go I'll go down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pots and and give them different
counts and then go back in 10 minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: do the squeeze test that you described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll know what my right count is,
because that'll be the pot that's reacting
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would even wait longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd wait a couple hours, you know,
to let let the moisture, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: migrate down into the into the bottom of
the pot and then feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water them, wait a couple hours and
then go back and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so certainly people water in
compost tea, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll they'll use some compost tea first
and then they will water their plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about like having your
water be compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a need for the fresh water in
addition to just compost tea or like they
[SPEAKER_00]: both have got water in them?
[SPEAKER_02]: They both have water in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I if I'm using a
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of my products is a liquid
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I definitely water it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've turned grass purple,
like literally purple because I put so
[SPEAKER_02]: much on it because I wanted to see what
was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the colors of the grass came out and
it just screamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned so dark green that it was almost
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the client's not going to like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I better water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, going back to compost
teas, as long as you have biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I would say, yeah, it's not going to
hurt to just give it a spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's after to try to move those
droplets of compost tea down into the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: profile where they belong, because they
don't belong on the surface.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the surface, they're just going to die
from the air in the UVs and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no, I totally get the practice of
watering in.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was doing a lot of installation of
product, what I would do is I would make,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, obviously my concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would add 10 gallons of the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would add, you know, 110 gallons of
water, a little bit of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would just go apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would apply it heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would do a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of it was getting the continued
spraying on top of it would push the first
[SPEAKER_02]: spray down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just be like, yeah,
you know, whatever evaporates or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: UVs kill these little guys, I'm not going
to be concerned about it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: drenched the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I inadvertently move the organisms down
into the lower profile that I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Layton, thank you so much for
sharing your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're on the road and consulting a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, maybe even a little bit less
right now in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you might actually be home quite
a bit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are normally traveling a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you even going to be home enough to
put into a food garden this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny you should say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been, God, 32 years more
since the last time I had the opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: to plant a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I've been planting a garden with
Pauline and our dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's out there helping me with the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm actually enjoying the
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely not working as hard or
earning as much as I would like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's this is all going to,
you know, peter out eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be able to get back on the road
and help other folks out across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for right now, I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm so blessed that I can still
support myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made enough money that I'm not going
to be freaking out that I can't pay my
[SPEAKER_02]: bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking the time and meditating,
playing in the soil, taking walks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, life is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying the quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for everybody out there that's
suffering because I know there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are, you know, that we're
living paycheck to paycheck and are
[SPEAKER_02]: totally screwed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm taking it with stride
and I'm trying to stay positive and send
[SPEAKER_02]: out good vibrations to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I'm actually I am growing a
food garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The revival of the Victory Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long term joke is that cannabis is a
gateway to horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these like new home
growers that are suddenly going,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I was able to grow a little bit of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what else I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the all the seed companies are
breaking new records for seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though there's the
vast majority of what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic is obviously terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make me feel some measure better
that people are learning how to grow their
[SPEAKER_00]: own foods, which we should never have lost
that skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that is something that can
continue moving forward for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is such an important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we all should be having at least
in our garden, if not at least a few
[SPEAKER_02]: veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that hard to do this,
whether it's in a pot or or it's planted
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's providing food security.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right about the seed companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're out of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I got to believe that
the vast majority of people across this
[SPEAKER_02]: country are growing these victory gardens,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully that never changes again,
because we can control the inputs of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going into these veggies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of stumbled into it because
because that's how we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to talking to you again in
person when we can.
