[SPEAKER_00]: So Dustin, thanks for taking some time to
talk with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while we haven't met before,
I follow your Instagram really closely
[SPEAKER_00]: because I found out about your,
what I'll think of as like an artisan
[SPEAKER_00]: professional group called Good Life Gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started looking and looking a
little more and I went over to your
[SPEAKER_00]: website at goodlifegang.tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw this huge wealth of information
for extract folk that was well above my
[SPEAKER_00]: head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, once you get into the
deep science and the SOPs, the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating procedures, you know,
those are really designed for folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: are literally in a lab and doing it every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know my way around the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, as I followed you and
I watched everybody comment on your
[SPEAKER_00]: threads, I'm getting an education in
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also realized that you had kind of
come up with this idea of Good Life Gang
[SPEAKER_00]: that was what I saw as a modern artisan
professional group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in cannabis right now,
so many of the professional groups are
[SPEAKER_00]: really just kind of marketing companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, let's all get together and help
each other get popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's different than like in the old
school days when there were artisan groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that would get together and trade
technique and complain about something
[SPEAKER_00]: together or buy materials in bulk,
where it was a real partnership,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from watching what you did was setting
that up, I feel like it's a good kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: model for setting up, you know,
positive artisan groups in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I wanted to sit down with you
just to give you a chance to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the genesis of Good Life Gang and
kind of your philosophy behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll tell people how to get
involved if they want to.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where'd it come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like the last part in like
this, you know, windy road to where I am
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started with the Skunk Farm team
several years ago, maybe four years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, right when Skunk Farm was becoming
farm gold here in Oregon, the company was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting bought by a large technical
company to build manufacturer equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk Farm is where I learned everything
that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Skunk Farm always ran on a model of
give all the information out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: free so that we can make better weed,
better extracts for achievers and more
[SPEAKER_01]: people can get more high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's do it safely and let's have a
good understanding of the science and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the tech that's going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I really broke my teeth on
the legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They poached me out of a legal processing
facility where I was the general manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk Farm Joe came, saw me and said,
hey, come work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we've got a better job for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was I saw how successful Skunk
Farm was, how they stood above everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else because they're the only people out
there giving away the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that company fell apart and we went
through pesticide remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started seeing legalization in
California and everybody had to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: license or pesticide free distillate all
of a sudden, and then you're sitting on
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of dollars of inventory of dirty
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's a huge problem in the
industry that maybe I can fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I started really leveraging
my Instagram to work with chemists because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am really good at leveraging other
people and their skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked with several high level
chemists and said, here is the and another
[SPEAKER_01]: lab that said we'll do all the testing for
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get part of publicity of,
you know, developing this tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said under one condition,
no matter what we figure out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the information, you can use it
however you want to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to use it however I want to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I'm going to use it is
I'm going to put it out on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: All open source.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the full SOP, the full tech,
exactly how to remediate Michael butanol
[SPEAKER_01]: from your distillate for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we threw that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That spiraled out of control into a
consulting business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden everybody wanted me to
come into their lab and teach them exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I saw right there is that the way
to stand aside in this this crowd right
[SPEAKER_01]: now is to be the open source guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like give away all the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that eventually evolved into a point
where the Instagram was no longer the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper medium for sharing all this
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back and look through the
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can search any specific details of
things that you may have learned yesterday
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're taking a poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we started a forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called future4200.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where all information and always
will be free completely to the user,
[SPEAKER_01]: including all the SOPs that you mentioned
previous that are in the Good Life Gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the difference between the two is
on the Good Life Game, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a structured SOP that you can turn into
your regulator and say this is how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to operate in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fully formatted.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the information that's in that SOP,
the step by step guide, that's on the form
[SPEAKER_01]: for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one's been formatted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what the Good Life Gang is,
is that everybody was saying we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a lot of community in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a community of smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we were losing rapidly was the
community of processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was just the guys with the farms
and they were processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that started squashing out,
we started seeing big business jump into
[SPEAKER_01]: processing and they are secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not working with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no community there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got all these small guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect their IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big evil word IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I saw all of us surviving
or all the guys at that level surviving
[SPEAKER_01]: was working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a co-op, like any other
agricultural processing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: they work cooperatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said we need a physical
representation of the gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I again leveraged my Instagram to get a
bunch of large scale suppliers,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that supply equipment to the
processing side of the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: lab society, Colombo labs, Beacon Ranch on
and on, to offer discounts to gang
[SPEAKER_01]: members.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said, look, you can,
to the people of Instagram, here's a price
[SPEAKER_01]: for annual, for lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only will you get discounts to all
of these vendors, so almost every single
[SPEAKER_01]: person that's joined, joined because
they're about to spend a bunch of money
[SPEAKER_01]: with another company and said,
I can spend $250 right now to save
[SPEAKER_01]: $10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an easy buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then on the side, you get all of the
SOPs to put into the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's another component of the good
life gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our knowledge sesh meetups and it's a
gang event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we currently are doing about one a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start hosting them on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have one Saturday for the
book, for the gang on, on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to start doing
regional ones where I probably won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming, but we're going to start,
because what we found is when we did these
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge sesh events, everybody that is
coming, is gang, gang members,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they're joining the gang when they're
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just about the tech,
it's about the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we actually have a physical
representation, a real life community,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just an internet forum where people
are talking, but people are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out and meeting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out all the people that come to
these events are doing the same exact
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge knowledge share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowledge share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, a good majority of the
people are licensed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's bottle swap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you're doing this or this,
and you're doing it for this price or this
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing this and this, and I can do it
for this price and this price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then guy number three comes into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, I can do that one part
for even cheaper, and we can all now make
[SPEAKER_01]: more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really what it's turned into is just a
big professional networking group where
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody in the same, kind of the same
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also I would think that when you
guys get together, not only can you,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you trade skills and then,
and then, you know, work together to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to make products cost the lowest
amount possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the kinds of people who are
working at that level are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: still relatively rare and they're often
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bring everybody else together,
you know, one of my buddies in extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: said extraction is a lonely career because
you're not only spending your time on your
[SPEAKER_00]: lab in the lab, but, you know,
chances are, you know, you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant other and you're in your close
friends don't even know what the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly you're bringing together the gang
and they're all like, my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got a support group.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you've got those like meet
relationships, then when you interact
[SPEAKER_00]: online again, it's way more real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, this is, it's all built around
the original skunk farm model of if you
[SPEAKER_01]: build up the people around you,
you know, if the people that you hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: with, the people that around you are
better people, then you yourself will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you can build those
people up, if you can build up the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already around you, then you
don't have to go find better people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's no, it's not, I don't
believe that people are bad people or good
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just haven't had good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can give every single person
that we've given good opportunity to is
[SPEAKER_01]: come back and paid it, you know,
paid it back time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it probably makes people really,
um, really enthusiastic to find something
[SPEAKER_00]: that not only feels like home and there's
a bunch of people smart, but also,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, that they received first,
they're like, Oh my God, this is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure this blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so they're putting their,
their tech and love and knowledge into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the positivity is infectious,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the negativity pushes people away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you run positive models like
this, they spread, it's infectious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants, because most of what we
see in life right now is not positive,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're watching the news or
listening to what people are saying on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in our industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, we've got no heritage growers
going on a business and the company's
[SPEAKER_00]: collapsing and we're all experiencing
industrial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that was left is now on fire
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the government doing that to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time for us to come together
in this kind of a, an artisan cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, if we don't do it now,
we're going to miss the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you look at, you know,
it's bigger than just what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: this country too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole country is going to miss the
boat to South America if we don't pick it
[SPEAKER_01]: up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we don't start working together and
the implications down the road of us
[SPEAKER_01]: working together, it's not just us being
more successful, but we start to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say we have power.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're a big enough group, we can
influence different things, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: politically specifically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, these people with their IP are
going to lose the game either to big
[SPEAKER_01]: business that's got better IP or has more
money to buy a better IP or to us that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'll just take the IP and then say,
we dare you to sue us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were a lawyer in the hill,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already seeing that happen.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I posted about this recently too,
the guy with the hops that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, CVD in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really liked what he was doing all
the way down to the last little bit when
[SPEAKER_01]: he had, he patented his specific strength,
kind of how Monsanto's patent their
[SPEAKER_01]: soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I understand that he put a lot
of work into it, but, uh, a real
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist, once they make mass
discoveries, they publish their
[SPEAKER_01]: information and then give it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody can, well, everybody with a
journal subscription can read about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then repeat it because that's good
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this whole model of patenting
something so we can make all the money in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world on it is, is going away from
like the initial intentions of science
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm much more about information yearns to
be free guy, you know, and I'm much more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in giving out the information
and then rapid prototyping so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: all evolve faster.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cause people are in the scarcity
mindset where money is the end all be all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's way more forms of capital than
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social capital is much more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What good is money if you have no social
capital?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause where are you going to spend the
money at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have friends that spend it on
or with, then what's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, your quality of life dwindles real
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so on the quality of life part,
um, you know, one of the things I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: are, are these sessions that you put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, I was so jealous
that you did a, uh, a combination sesh,
[SPEAKER_00]: pool party down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so to give people kind of an idea
of what this is like, just, just describe
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of the sessions and how you guys
blend this knowledge share with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, Colombo labs and I have been
co-hosting these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we use the power of social media to
get a bunch of really good, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: People bring it by the droves cause they
want everybody to smoke and know their
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a table full of stuff to smoke
more, more stuff than you could ever want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody brings a little bit of their own
cause they, you know, they have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, had it catered by medicated and
awake this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rented a really nice house in the
hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, it was where a decent amount
of the admission came.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a nice big private venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually really hard to rent a big
place that you can host events at cause
[SPEAKER_01]: they all put cameras outside to make sure
that you're not bringing extra guests in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we paid a little extra for the.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be straight up about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're having a barbecue and there's
going to be a lot of weed smoked outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, all right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're adults and we clean up after
ourselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the neighbor, the neighbor behind us,
it was the director of Boondock saints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came over and was like,
Hey guys, we're going to be having a
[SPEAKER_01]: little party tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to let you know,
we're being a little loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually didn't even know that we'd
already been there two days, had a session
[SPEAKER_01]: and hadn't heard us at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had heard them the night before the guy
is a partier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, yeah, the homeowner
thanked us for, for how appropriate we
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was a big pool party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we did two, two days of just pure
knowledge session and one day of just pure
[SPEAKER_01]: pool party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a little bit of mix in
both days, but on the knowledge test days,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of the primer is a, an intro to
making money in a dying hash industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how to make, how to make the best
quality distillate specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just like Colombo labs does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you can make distillate like
Colombo labs does, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all right in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, it's a walkthrough,
like a verbal walkthrough with question
[SPEAKER_01]: and answers on very specific, um,
like the master SOP that we just posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Colombo labs, specific step-by-step
directions on how to replicate history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's like, oh, we're talking over
and going into fine details on each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: points right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last year that we've done,
we didn't have any equipment on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all whiteboard and discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we did about three hours of
scripted discussion, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with Q and A intermixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a big group Q and A,
and then we broke into like one-on-one
[SPEAKER_01]: question answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, uh, come to see if,
you know, whether or not they want to hire
[SPEAKER_01]: one of us as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like the primer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we give them discounts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they're gang members, they get even
more discounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so then we do like a one-on-one,
everybody gets like roughly an hour with
[SPEAKER_01]: us if they want it to give me specific
questions out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a big social networking for
however long we're all still awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that sounds like a good time,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's a professional advancement
somehow at the same time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's, again, it's, it's a social
capital because now all of these people
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of guys come, uh, they're not
processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are trying to find a way into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got a bunch of people that
are high level processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often they're hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So multiple people have gotten hired from
coming to the such events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, multiple people have made connections
on, you know, one side or the other of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of supplying this or that, um,
business relationships have been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we, we had like five people that
went to one of our first knowledge session
[SPEAKER_01]: pay the, to come back to this one again,
because it was so valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time is that, you know,
it'd be different content too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different mix of people, different side
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've made advances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went deep into some of the different
theoretical advancements in, in short path
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the advanced chemistry that
we've been playing around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the stuff you're talking about that
maybe would be over, over your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a certain group came specifically
just for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, they're getting kind of where
we're at with our theoretical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are, it's our, you know,
rapid prototyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sneak that in all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the most powerful things
Instagram has been for me is I can come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a harebrained idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know, you know, we know why,
uh, you know, the idea behind it and why
[SPEAKER_00]: you pulled it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a general idea of what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, part of why I wanted to talk
with you and shoot it is so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people in other parts of the
industry and then definitely other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the car, you know, the U S and the
world maybe can use it as a model,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now is the time for us to pull
together like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so from what you experienced,
you know, um, you know, it didn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like you actually intended to do this in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just followed the steps of what seemed
next to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then looking back, it looks like a
really beautiful arc to build this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what hints would you give somebody
who, who thinks that what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the model is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to put something like that
together for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, first and foremost,
it's important to remember that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple forms of capital out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dollar is just a means to an end,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have social capital and,
um, you know, which is mainly the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is the main one that I focus on
leveraging because again, that's where all
[SPEAKER_01]: money comes from is other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another thing to keep in mind is that
I am a relatively selfish person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gang is to build other people up to
build up myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so by offering way more value than the
cost of the membership, people can easily
[SPEAKER_01]: justify the cost and that, that money in
the mail for me, that's the, that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: paycheck right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'm not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm building up other people with
a positive business model and it's paying
[SPEAKER_00]: me lucratively and you're facilitating
other people's careers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just leveraged Instagram notoriety,
you know, and that was just because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: the one of the first guys doing this,
you know, I was early on doing this and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was definitely one of the first guys
giving out all the information after Skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: Farm went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plays on a key point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find your niche.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, focus on not what everybody else
is doing, you know, don't make distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's making distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not focus on the waste streams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does everybody, people are paying to
get rid of their green waste, their plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material to the garbage man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, find out how much you're paying the
garbage man and go in and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, you can pay me to take your bio
waste and then turn it into paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it into plastic, do any of the things
that we can do with bio waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of waste streams in this
industry specifically that nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: touching on or little niche markets that
nobody's, you know, nobody's looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that those, that's one of the most
important things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's find something that not everybody
else is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like pull together your group of
people were doing indoor no-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because like, if you find those
kinds of people, they are just as hardcore
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastic as your extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have got secret knowledge
and they also, you know, often work alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, now you're playing off the social
capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found a niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else, what else would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so maybe in, you know,
let's say keeping it positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know from following you that you
are, you know, you, you really want to act
[SPEAKER_00]: for the good of humans, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like humans, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but you know, a lot of people come
into groups feeling kind of competitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to win them over a
little bit with like the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Instagram is a hostile place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so how, how did you kind of manage?
[SPEAKER_00]: To build it up and keep it positive when
people would come and bring their
[SPEAKER_01]: competitiveness?
[SPEAKER_01]: We call that the fuck you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have, and I'm not talking
about dollar bills again here,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about real wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six years ago, we bought 20 acres up on
the coast of Washington and turned it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in the process of converting
into a permaculture farm ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably till I die, it'll be in a
constant state of evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we started producing basically free
bacon on the farm, I realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, you know, what's the point of
working, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just to feed yourself and have
shelter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I already did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so what's the point of continuing
to make money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to really go on a deep soul
searching to figure out what, what is my
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive to continue to, um, want to do
anything at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'd rather just sit on the farm and
grow bacon for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's lucrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you literally mean bacon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through a system of, um, you know,
managed or holistically managed rotational
[SPEAKER_01]: grazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about a south facing slope,
put in terraces, swales, ponds,
[SPEAKER_01]: little beds, plant fruit trees and nut
trees on the slopes and run animals on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flats on a continuous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets better every year,
you know, they, they continue to poop and
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil gets better and the trees bruise
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, once I got to that state of mind,
um, I realized that money was no longer my
[SPEAKER_01]: main incentive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building up my own social capital by
building up other people, which I had
[SPEAKER_01]: found paid back in full, almost always
learning the model from Snug Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became my desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my pursuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much social capital can I build?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the fastest way to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I listened to Tim Ferris,
four hour work week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really when I, my brother
bought me the book for Christmas and
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't read it, hadn't read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you read that book?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to run the excavator for a
month on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he got me the audio book.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'm telling you, you got to
listen to this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I kind of had been floating the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right for pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, this is exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned Tim Ferris's four hour work
week model into the good life game.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd already been talking about it a little
bit with Sidco Zach, my IT guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the owner of future 4,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, you know, the push that I
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, here's how I can basically
automate a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's difficult to automate a business
when you can't do merchant services
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a gang and it's a cannabis
gang.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of, yeah, and I didn't want
to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name precludes some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually, they're, they're okay
with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lifetime memberships and nobody
wants to support because they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what if you die?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're liable to their customers
on PayPal said no as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they own Venmo as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about like the kind of
model itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, even though I'm not a
member of good life gang, I'm supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I'm getting, you're still
looking for new members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so like give your pitch for
joining good life gang and how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's $250 a year for an annual
membership.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thousand dollars for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer a hundred lifetime memberships
each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to reset on four 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the lifetime members this year will
get all this plus lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on four 20, there'll be a hundred more
and the price for the lifetime is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: double.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's unlimited annual
memberships.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be an affiliated company,
you get a free membership.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do to be an affiliated
company is offer some sort of product that
[SPEAKER_01]: are that influences the, or the,
our community, something that our
[SPEAKER_01]: community would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get your free membership.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you give a discount and get a
membership on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodlifegang.tech is where all the
information at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a web browser URL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently that is hard to convey over
text.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goodlifegang.tech is a URL that you
put into your browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of .com it's .tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get your login,
it's turf.goodlifegang.tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, your login for feature 4,200 is
not the same as your login for good life
[SPEAKER_01]: gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of my most important things that
I take a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say it again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to figure out better ways to
like, get the information out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a constant battle on the,
it's that whole Tim Ferris automate your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the Tim Ferris thing,
it makes a lot of sense too, because as a
[SPEAKER_00]: guy who naturally is into rapid
prototyping, you know that, that that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: in with Tim Ferris, like, like other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take that Tim Ferris,
cause a lot of people will look at what he
[SPEAKER_01]: says and it's like, oh, you're just
stepping on the backs of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you take that positive
forward model and you're building up all
[SPEAKER_01]: those other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at it like that,
if you're using a fulfillment center,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you're giving business to that
fulfillment center.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a, all of his model is
about going out and finding people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are offering services that can enable you
to be automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're just getting things
for free from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying an assistant, you're paying
all these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not setting up a win lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's win, win, win, win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're adding, the value you're
adding, you're just like, oh, if we put
[SPEAKER_00]: these together like this, boom,
it's a new thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally there is no loser in the good
life gang model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vendors are getting access to very
specific customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: The customers are getting discounts from
them for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm getting paid for
facilitating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting way more discount or
benefit when they meet each other and hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out at gang events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's all, it's all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to hit the why to join bit
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if you were to go through a bullet
points for the things that you get for
[SPEAKER_00]: your membership fee, what are those bullet
points?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get discounts with leading vendors
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a good life gang lab coat
embroidered with your whatever you want
[SPEAKER_01]: embroidered on it, but it also says good
life gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get access to our full SOP deck,
including all of our safety data sheets
[SPEAKER_01]: provided by carbon chemistry, as well as
lab hygiene plans, all of the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: standards that you're going to need and
forms that you're going to need to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: out if you're setting up a processing lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get access to gang meetups,
which will very soon be regionally right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to kind of, you're going to have
to come to me soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the gang events are going to be on
the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw your new concrete slab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just going to be a kitchen
and a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, there's an intern barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a fully finished, big giant
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I actually rent a house down in
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place I live is so cheap and
depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rent a really nice house right on the
river for no, like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't actually live up on the farm.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the kitchen where we
host gang events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so I'll go ahead and add,
uh, I'll type this out at a screen grab at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of this, but, um, how do you want
people to reach out to you if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: either know more or if they just want to
join.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: DMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm like religious about answering my
DMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people ignore them,
but I'm not that I kind of fanatical about
[SPEAKER_01]: answering them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you do DM me like two sentences
that is didn't get right to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at future 4,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram where you can email me at
consulting futures.com or at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and where you can DM me on the forum
too, which is future 4,200.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any three of those ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on the future 4,200.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that, uh, that that's a free
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get all this information,
which it sounds like it's, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: more discussions and forums and a little
more disorganized, but it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into it, it's there and you
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're a newbie and then,
you know, goodlifegang.tech, it is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, kind of like a best practices and
cleaned up and that's going to cost you
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but if you're watching the video and
you want to learn this stuff, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: go to future 4,200 and participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should go there first because
I'm just one guy and Colombo is just one
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of experience,
but future 4,200 is now leveraging a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of really smart people, a lot of people
that are way smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're having discussions on there
that are influencing our SOPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our distillate is improving
because of the conversations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being had on future 4,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the group is way smarter than any
one individual.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eye of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, um, if, if,
if you're watching and you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into cannabis, especially extraction,
you know, just go and lurk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like most everything there is,
is, is over my knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way that I get better is by
learning these things and then go and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and certainly my experience level has
raised just, just from hanging out,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I don't have anything valuable
to contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's 90% of my interaction with the
forum is leveling myself up based on what
[SPEAKER_01]: other people have said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, that's some smart stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got people like photon on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you're going to learn from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's a genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get, and to get free access to
these lines, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really nice to meet you,
Dustin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that you gave me some of
your time so we can hang out and turn
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
Thank you.
