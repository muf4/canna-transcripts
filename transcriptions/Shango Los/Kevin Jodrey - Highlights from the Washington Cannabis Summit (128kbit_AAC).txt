[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's Shango from the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a few weeks ago I was at the
Washington Cannabis Summit and Kevin Jodry
[SPEAKER_00]: was there up from Wonderland Nursery in
Humboldt County where he lives and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Cannabis as Agriculture panel and
it was a fantastic panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the whole panel was great,
but you know I'm a big fan of Kevin Jodry
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I pulled out all the bits with
Kevin talking and edited them all together
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm posting it here for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you can kind of consider
it a whole bunch of Kevin Jodry gems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks a little bit about terpenes of
course, he talks a bit about strain
[SPEAKER_00]: choice, a little bit about russet mites
and you know a little bit of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all solid gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to the Cannabis Alliance for
letting me record and thanks for Kevin for
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and sharing his insights with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for showing up today
and allowing me to speak in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure to come to
Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an exceptional audience to get to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background in cannabis is pretty
expensive in terms of, in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've been involved in cannabis for
about 41 years and I always as a child
[SPEAKER_02]: believed we would end up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew at some point that cannabis would
become accepted in a different view and I
[SPEAKER_02]: approached it from that point of view and
so I tried to understand as much as I
[SPEAKER_02]: could about what I was doing so that I
would have a future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believed at some point I would end up
here and I knew that I would have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to have a skill set to survive so to
speak and a lot of my study in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and work in cannabis was trying to
understand primarily how does one get
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to the table which means how do
we get it to the market and that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: the most important thing to me because
that dictates everything backwards and
[SPEAKER_02]: then when you put ethics with it you
actually have a pretty sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: situation so we combine how do we get
product to the table and how do we do it
[SPEAKER_02]: in an ethical manner and I think that what
you have with cannabis is it was held in
[SPEAKER_02]: check for so long that what we did was we
created an entire library of genetics that
[SPEAKER_02]: were improperly sourced.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did all these years is we chose
cannabis for stealth so we took away a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the desirability and smell and we used
all these illegal pesticides and
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides and PGRs plant growth
regulators to assist us and what happened
[SPEAKER_02]: over all these years decades is that we
created a gene pool that's weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: We chose varieties that were trendy and we
bred them too heavily and we bottomed that
[SPEAKER_02]: group and so what you have is you have
this incredible population of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that we use that are inherently
prone to all these different pathogenic
[SPEAKER_02]: problems, pest problems, inherently weak
in certain circumstances, exceptionally
[SPEAKER_02]: hungry for exceptionally high nutrient
levels because everyone always gave their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants the most fertile soil with the best
situation and when you select in that
[SPEAKER_02]: situation what you select is plants that
thrive in perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it living in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to see is a plant that really
got mistreated in a horrible situation
[SPEAKER_02]: that didn't get fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the plant that I really want to see
because that's the one that we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: work with and so I'm known in cannabis as
a nursery operator but I have a farm and
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm kind of vertical so I have a lot of
stuff going on but I'm known primarily for
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery work and in California I basically
created the modern nursery model in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of some walk-in store nursery front.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never done prior to that and I
created the nursery model from
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries where the dispensary itself
created the stock so the last 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been applying what I learned in the
30 years prior and from all of that what
[SPEAKER_02]: we found was that most cultivators are
basically praying for success and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately praying in their own
direction because what they do is they
[SPEAKER_02]: choose products that are trendy with no
consideration for where they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate it and with no consideration for
cultivation methodologies or the operators
[SPEAKER_02]: and no diversity and what happens is that
you will use OG Cush as an example just
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just such a hot move from
where we live in California so everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to grow OG but OG is a massive
family so depending on what cultivar of OG
[SPEAKER_02]: you get you might get one that's
exceptionally powdery milky prone,
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptionally matrigous prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have russet and brood mints that
are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are prone to those also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epidural layers are thick enough,
doesn't resist and so people use these
[SPEAKER_02]: inferior cultivars and they wonder why
they're getting a little crap kicked off
[SPEAKER_02]: them the entire time they cultivate and so
what we tried to do through the normal
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery model was do population sifts so
what I do is I go through large
[SPEAKER_02]: populations of plants and we find the
outliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find plants that have an ability to
resist naturally and this is a normal
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky in that I get to tour all kinds
of neat facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to see some really interesting stuff
but I get to go and do a tour of the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest redwood nursery propagation
facility in the world so Green Diamond is
[SPEAKER_02]: the world's largest redwood producer
they're also the largest redwood nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to talk to their lead grower who's
been cultivating there for 48 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's involved in a breeding project that
will take 150 years and so he only carries
[SPEAKER_02]: the first third of the program but he took
me out into his mother library so to speak
[SPEAKER_02]: which was acres and acres of forest and it
was from every thousand acres of redwoods
[SPEAKER_02]: the biologists selected one as the
greatest of that thousand acres and they
[SPEAKER_02]: brought that and held it and so I get to
tour the entire forest with nothing of
[SPEAKER_02]: trees but that had been selected from
thousand acre lots and one of these trees
[SPEAKER_02]: was number 48 and it was I think a hundred
and eighty percent greater growth than any
[SPEAKER_02]: other redwood ever recorded but they were
intelligent enough to not monocrop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not monocrop that gulfabar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they did is they put it so many miles
from the other plants they worked with so
[SPEAKER_02]: that these patches these 40-50 acre
forests of that specific were laid out so
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a diversity so even though it's
within the same family the cultivars have
[SPEAKER_02]: been separated and for redwood it takes
about 130-140 years to do seed propagation
[SPEAKER_02]: and so his phrase was it takes 150 years
before she gets sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something that made me understand
that what we're doing now is we're in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the foundation of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: California's only legal for four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the foundation of this modern
cannabis world in terms of how do we
[SPEAKER_02]: approach cultivar selection, how do we
approach ITN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people have no clue what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a label off a pair of pants made
because really most cultivators in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis have never been in mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington's got a head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have been legal for a while now
so it's been very eye-opening to come here
[SPEAKER_02]: for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have because you get to see integration
at a level that we don't have in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California we have a much looser
situation where I get to work with a
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendous number of professors from
universities, scientists from private
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations because they can't touch
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't have it in their hands so to
speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't have it at the school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't have it at the facilities so
they find guys like me that are willing to
[SPEAKER_02]: play detective and we chase problems so we
look through cultivars to see what we can
do to resist.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in and analyze and say this one
is virally infected, this one is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens when we grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you start to have happening is you
start having this intersection between the
[SPEAKER_02]: science component and the actual ag
component because it took them in
[SPEAKER_02]: radically different worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, science is an understanding but
it's a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the whole old variables
constant in order to solve for X.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that as a farmer and I've
farmed too and I've been farming for a
[SPEAKER_02]: really long time and on an organic level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an attempt to try to understand how
does one as a farmer take the information
[SPEAKER_02]: from normal agricultural practices that
are organically based, biologically driven
[SPEAKER_02]: and then apply it to what we do and
actually have some success.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing ketchup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like ketchup, I like mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ketchup is where you have a problem and
then you try to figure out how to solve
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have to be able to understand with
some of this stuff going on is how to be
[SPEAKER_02]: more proactive in our approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said prior, for me, I like to work
off populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find is that if I want to get a
good friend, you might find him in a group
[SPEAKER_02]: of two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find it a little better if it's
with 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find a really decent person in a
group of 2,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get 20,000, you're going to find
something exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I see cannabis called the bar
selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bar selection is the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, we've been learning these black
market operations for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: These incredible populations that I've
worked with are highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been legally as a farm operator for
years, but all the R&D, all the work,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the prior stuff, that was all through
the desire for people who really were into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, where you were really about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were willing to take the risk to hunt
the product that was going to work for you
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever your needs were.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that was economic needs, those are
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was for medicinal needs,
then perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was for personal needs, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires you to be able to have enough
of an ability to understand what is it
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeking and how do you ascertain
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've tried to do is we've tried to
take these cultivars from these big
[SPEAKER_02]: populations, and then I used Momoli's
technology to map them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does, it allows people not to be
able to find that cultivar that we know is
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptionally pathogenically resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivars that we have that are
exceptionally prone to problems like cold,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if they're desirable because they're
too risky for cultivators to take a gamble
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens is you end up having to neck
down the populations you work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to find specific cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market's trendy, but when you chase
those trends, you'll chase yourself right
[SPEAKER_02]: into some bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we try to recommend to individuals is
a diversity in terms of what would be
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse in terms of resistance so that we
have the greatest chance of survival of a
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of the crop, and then we work on
diversity in terms of market velocity,
[SPEAKER_02]: how fast those products move through the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have things that are trending very
quickly, but they're in smaller markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: and things that are very stable in
movement, larger markets but lower price
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to get this weird intersection of
what is the plant that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with and how do you get it to
function for you in a way that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept about monoculture is an
important one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had this discussion this morning
about the banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 50s and 60s, there was a song,
there'd be no more bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because there was no more bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a Fusarium outbreak that wiped
out all the bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They find another banana called the
Cavendish cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They find the Cavendish cultivar in
another country, and they introduce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lo and behold, it works great and it's
resistant to Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's happy, but why did that
cultivar really succeed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't for the resistance as much as
you thought it was because it didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be refrigerated when you moved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could handle 45 to 55 degrees on
movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed the economic consideration of
that cultivar dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it to where they could cheapen the
price of shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only was it resistant, but it was
cheaper to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, just within the last year,
there's another full of Fusarium that is
[SPEAKER_02]: attacking the Cavendish cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're about to see another one of
these bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana epidemics, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I see within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see certain populations that are
exceptionally prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We noticed when Fusarium came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We noticed when, well, PM's been here for
a long time, probably 15, 18 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when it first came in,
I can retrace it back into Oregon Roads,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the roads grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of see where things moved
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, the broad mite that came in,
the russet mite that followed,
[SPEAKER_02]: these issues already were relatively new.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speed at which they moved is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same situation where the only way
you're going to find out resistance on
[SPEAKER_02]: these is if you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People try to keep everything as protected
as possible all the time in the production
[SPEAKER_02]: end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, there's very little R&D done in
cannabis where you're actually exposing
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants to these issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I can do it because I own a
nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: My nursery is a little different than most
nurseries because I own my location in Ojo
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: In English, that means that I supply to
people who produce tonnage for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might estimate that the work that the
nursery creates might come out anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: between 150 to 200 million dollars a year
in product grown from the cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the last four years, I might be
involved in 800 million dollars in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't create 800 million dollars
myself, but my nursery stock created
[SPEAKER_02]: approximately that much value.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge responsibility in your mind to
understand how you maintain this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with the farmers and how you
keep people solving, how you keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we see now is basically like a clone
through somebody or I grab something from
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody and no one has any data on it,
none.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, in order to make it work the way I
do, at the tonnage plant, is that we
[SPEAKER_02]: always typically release a cultivar a year
after selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does is it lets me take a look
at a plant and then I can put it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: four major production groupings,
which is indoor, outdoor, rehousing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those four different situations have
radical different impacts on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar's performance, its morphological
traits, its desirability to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this stuff takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a situation where we're all
operating using stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start to DNA it through the
beauty of the galaxy, and I have no
[SPEAKER_02]: affiliation with the company, so it's not
that I'm pushing the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that I use the tool because it lets
me get a really clear look at where the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom line is and where the diversity is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way we can start to say, let's
diversify what we're working with
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in these things, what information do
we have and how do we start to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've tried to do all these years,
which just caused some of my friends in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past to be in unbelievable stress,
was I was very golden with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shared the vast majority of this
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shared the vast majority of these
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't hold them proprietary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put it in a situation where all
these special individuals got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower you were ranked in the canvas
kingdom, the kinder I was to you because
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamentally, that's what makes up the
canvas kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made up of regular ordinary
individuals who are about candidates.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's the most important part
because that's the human connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what allows us to have a different
industry model.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what allows cannabis to be unique
in the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to actually create an
industry based off of our relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see very little relationship with
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see relationship with money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not anti-business at all, but that
shouldn't be the driving force solely for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of this stuff that we're trying to
understand is, how do we take the
[SPEAKER_02]: information from very intelligent
scientists, researchers, nursery operators
[SPEAKER_02]: who work with regulatory process,
and how do you take that information and
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you apply it to what you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that is the applicability that
matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, you get out of talking to me,
it's really about how you get the product
[SPEAKER_02]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is compensation,
but that's my main direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope today that we can get into some
stuff about how do we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for letting me be
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that so much of it is
money-driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever take a look at products that
are sold to cannabis people, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: mind-bending how much more expensive they
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this article years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about the CBD-specific bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could it possibly target CBD by
itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and researched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the company that made the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I found the real ag product,
which was the same product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was five bucks for the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 100 bucks for cannabis-related
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is, cannabis people can't sue
you, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us are unable to come after you
in court.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the ability to say,
hey, listen, you sold me some product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dequeued on my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with the accountability,
you'll have to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to tell people all the time,
any product you see that's working that
[SPEAKER_02]: well, have that stuff checked because
there's nothing that knocks anything back
[SPEAKER_02]: organically like a chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It slows the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't just wipe it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When anyone sees anything that's moving
too well, it's too trendy, and it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: pricey, we just wait, and then it comes up
on a ban list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, you don't want the same
cultivar on every part of the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States because it's really not meant for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be for geographical zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way, you're optimizing the actual
situation you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor is a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever you want, no matter
where you are in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most expensive form of
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of individuals, outdoor is
pretty accurate in terms of profitability,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's going to be specific for your
location.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can share the information and get the
data, but ultimately, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: to do another sifting process to get the
cultivar working the dampness of coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington versus the interior dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reach me direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even talking about reaching me
direct to buy the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying I'm pretty accessible to
talk about products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to share the information or
otherwise we're going to collapse as a
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Canada so much because it's all
these small individuals that made it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how America's run, but I'm
definitely against taking over an industry
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hands of a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I try to share as much as I can
and get as many products into the market
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't share genetics into other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a leak, but the information is
definitely available.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: See me after the thing and I'll give you
an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can chop it up about what is it
that you're trying to do, what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling with, and then we'll take a
look at what your market is because the
[SPEAKER_02]: market determines where you're going to
put this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just grow stuff that you want to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get confused with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to grow things that the market
wants, but the market's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to take a look at that
market and then from there you neck down
[SPEAKER_02]: what works in your specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of it is trying to find other
farmers around you that have similar
[SPEAKER_02]: geographical situations, environmental
conditions, cultivation, sameness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'll be able to work in groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky in the sense that I get to
provide genetics with the State of
[SPEAKER_02]: California, which is massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me work with hundreds of thousands
of people over these years about how to
[SPEAKER_02]: perform for you and those locations and
what happened and was it resistant and
[SPEAKER_02]: were there problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we can start to take a look and say,
hey, this cultivar that was selected for
[SPEAKER_02]: this shines here but does not do well
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would allow you to get that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll build this situation with your
friends too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to team up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot be a solo producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the word proprietary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's proprietary and CEO, the two words
that I use to lose it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that word in another sentence and they
can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just know that I proprietary
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you got it from somebody down
the street and now you're claiming it's
[SPEAKER_02]: yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you want to be able to do is work in
conjunction and the combined brain power
[SPEAKER_02]: of many farmers is really driven
agricultural forward for millennia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now science has taken over and it creates
a situation where there's only certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things that can enter the market because
they have engineered resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not at that level right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still at the level of you have to
provide to the table and you have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to use conventional farming
technology to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, sharing the information with
your friends, making the genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: available, everyone thinks that if I give
you this clone, it's going to take away my
[SPEAKER_02]: whole world too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if your market is that small,
my god, you're really in a bubble on
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to be able to just see
like that and you have to be careful who
[SPEAKER_02]: you work with because otherwise you're not
going to get the data back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for someone who's a farmer,
who's trying to produce cannabis or wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand how to use varieties and
these methods, you team up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm about collaboration on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see this any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, combined we are a massive
producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no brand in Washington or
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a guy that ran a seven billion
dollar liquor operation and he gave me the
[SPEAKER_02]: lecture on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a CEO.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a CEO of a seven billion dollar
liquor distributorship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, Kev, he goes, none of you are
a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, in liquor, a brand is you can be
in 44,000 stores at once and within 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, you can restock all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, none of you guys are brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must work collectively to form
regional brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually over time,
those things will become large powerhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: commodities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the interim, you must work
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis, especially where we are at
Humboldt, oh my god, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fight those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where everybody who's a little mini came
running their own little mini world and
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody wanted to team up on anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that the money's drained out of
the system, people are a lot more willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go, poverty, just not for a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poverty is good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's humbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes for a stand to work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be able to team up in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone believes they're so smart and
so big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all these guys are the giant
ag farmers and they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: revolutionize the kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get buried alive because cannabis
is a specialty cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have to go through this
process to learn and understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is no giant advantage right
now except in terms of scope and scale and
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of knowledge of the cultivar,
how to work with the product, and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding how to work together,
we can build that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really have this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you jump to that, before you jump
to the next question, you can't use turf
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do so much R&D for other companies on
inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've run all the tests afterwards
to see these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just did video on this because it
was so fascinating that you could not
[SPEAKER_02]: tell, a human could not tell which sample
came out of those two bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them was very high in alpha and
beta-pinene, zero canthine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other variety was high in
canthine, no alpha and beta-pinene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, one of them is right,
one of them is not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're both right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people believe is that when you add
an input, you just increase the turfs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's all going to move linearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have bacteria that converts
turkeys into other turkeys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have all these enzymatic
conversions that make smell appear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're looking at that from
that point of view, it's moved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people like the way it smells,
ultimately?
[SPEAKER_02]: The big numbers are nice on the display
board at the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bottom line is trying to use
turkeys to market variety is exceptionally
[SPEAKER_02]: inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been trying to do this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we fingerprint it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the DNA comes in and then it
prints it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to have more logical
changes and subtle shifts in what things
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a gene level, the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But turfs, all over the place,
and you don't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what blew my mind was I'm comparing
these tests, and I'm preparing this with R
[SPEAKER_02]: &D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one in my circle, we're all career
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know cannabis pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could not differentiate which one was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them, very high in pinene,
the other one high in canthine.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they don't smell the same in terms of
canthine and pinenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But exact same strain, just two different
inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your farm, what you'll find is that for
you, you're trying to find out what
[SPEAKER_02]: creates the most distinctive, desirable
impact on the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's working with your inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to discover what you use
on your farm drives in the direction you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, what the turkey's signature
is, oh my god, it's so variable there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's so complex that people
are trying to dumb it down too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too vague.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they vibrate over the winter?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do apply them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do apply them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was asked that by a reporter,
and I had them talk to the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use them for stark thistle in the
face of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pioneered that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Humboldt County, they probably wiped
out a billion dollars worth of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're spraying this stuff
continuously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can clean your crop as much as
you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was cultivar selection
on things that have a higher resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you work with your beneficial
insect company to work on a strategy of
[SPEAKER_02]: juvenile adults at a predation rate that's
going to outcompete it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had them blow over the hill and
land on a farm this year, my own farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw some iron bugs present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let us know if there was some food,
which means they were eating something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once we started to find the
silicone nodules on the bottom of those
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, we were like, here they go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was too late to use sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur works really well for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entomatics are tough because they bleach
the leaf a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So enzymes are tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And entomatics leave the culture on the
plant, which then disqualifies you from
[SPEAKER_02]: selling the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on what point in time you're
going to use some of these tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sulfur and nephron flower is going to
be an effective product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entomatics and nephron flower is going to
be an effective product in terms of foam.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the beneficial insects work is just
that people don't do it at the level you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking, you've got to get on every
one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need juveniles and adults so that
the adults come out and go right to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the juveniles colonize and work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I was running three times the
normal level of predation that was
[SPEAKER_02]: required.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I salvaged that crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably lost maybe 5% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends lost 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the chemists?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see plants that have inherent
levels of rest of my resistance that are
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly different than others?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I almost think it's due to,
I want to say, a tough record for the
[SPEAKER_02]: dural layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see plants that have like rhino skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I'm doing tests, and I have a
tremendous number of cultivars at the test
[SPEAKER_02]: site, certain ones get into that,
and certain ones don't, at different
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is that the stuff that's
resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're selecting for that dural layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I know that what I can say is,
hey, we've had very good success with
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use this as a portion of your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't want to be so
monocultured that way either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now you're prone to some other
pathogenic problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to figure out what's your
distribution based off of market velocity
[SPEAKER_02]: and survivability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be able to get yourself into a
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires a tremendous amount of
pre-emptive work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be on it before it ever
happens.
Thank you.
