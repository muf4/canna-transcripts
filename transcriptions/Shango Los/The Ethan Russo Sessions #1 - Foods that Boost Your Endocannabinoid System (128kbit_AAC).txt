[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first Shaping Fire sessions,
I sat down with Kevin Jodhury of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland Nursery in Humboldt County,
and by all accounts, it was a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did he and I have a really good
time making it for you, but tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of you have watched the videos,
and so we are calling it a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not seen the Kevin Jodhury
sessions, you can go ahead and click up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the playlist above and see all the
episodes bundled together and watch them
[SPEAKER_00]: all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, though, I am here to launch Shaping
Fire Sessions number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I sat down with Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful that over the holidays,
Ethan invited me over to his house,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we did a long interview on a wide
range of topics that are now cut up into
[SPEAKER_00]: topic-related snippets that we'll be
publishing over the next month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'd expect, we talked a lot about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about managing pain with
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of a particular terpene you need
for some sort of medical efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also talked about the potential for
terpene toxicity when dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit on a couple other non-terpene
topics, too, including, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: how mushrooms, psilocybin mushrooms,
work on the brain to cause neurological
[SPEAKER_00]: healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this first episode, which is on
what foods that you can eat to support
[SPEAKER_00]: your endocannabinoid system in addition to
the cannabinopathic care that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a whole bunch of episodes
that are going to be coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot to True Terpenes for
sponsoring the YouTube channel so we could
[SPEAKER_00]: bring you this series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Ethan, thank you so much for getting
together today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first question I wanted to
ask you, when you do your presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll often kind of mention in passing
that, you know, we can do all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid supplementation of our
endocannabinoid system to help strengthen
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often you'll mention that there may be
foods that we can eat as well which will
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I followed that a little bit,
and I found that you had an entire paper
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope that you would break down
for us kind of simply the foods that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, and especially patients,
could be eating to help support and
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen their endocannabinoid system in
addition to the regular cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: therapies they're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's no simple single food that's
going to serve that purpose on toning up
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, an anti-inflammatory diet,
which is very different from what
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans typically eat with its fried
foods and emphasis on that kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: is not advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, in general, having a lot of fruits
and vegetables is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory and much more
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of attention has been paid towards
things like fish oil and other essential
[SPEAKER_01]: fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are great, being strongly
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have any evidence that they
directly increase the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real answer is that to do this
nutritionally, you have to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: indirect and affect the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbiome are the gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have probably been hearing more
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have heard the term probiotics,
which are beneficial bacteria like are in
[SPEAKER_01]: yogurt and in lacto-fermented foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: These have a strong anti-inflammatory
effect on the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help prevent diseases such as
diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, we have increasing
evidence that they have a key role in
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the gain in the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, it's not just a matter of
increasing these bacteria, but they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the right food themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of what we might throw at them
in a typical American diet isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be helpful that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, they like things that are a little
bit hard for humans to digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these include certain kinds of
vegetable fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are not likely familiar with things
like burdock root or acacia fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are fibers that are normally
indigestible for humans, but are sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the great feedstock for the gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the simpler groups of foods that's
really helpful are the leaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is your onions, leeks,
garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gut bacteria really like those as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some simple supplements that
people can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burdock can be obtained in supplement
capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the acacia fiber is available online
if it's not in your store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for instance, it's a simple thing to
add a tablespoon of that to granola in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone's taking a good probiotic
with a wide variety of species,
[SPEAKER_01]: not single agents, chances are they're
going to see some benefits down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: in all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the regulation of their gut,
maybe less pain, improved sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: even clearing up of acne in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all things that have been
tied in to the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_01]: the gut bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that tie-in point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first part was all about the
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the anti-inflammatory what happens at
the same time as supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it through taking, is it the
decrease in inflammatory that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual benefit of the endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the tie-in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's really both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if someone's eating a lot of fruits
and vegetables, particularly dark colored
[SPEAKER_01]: berries, blueberries for example,
these have a lot of flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are natural antioxidants and there
are correlations that have been drawn
[SPEAKER_01]: between having a diet that's rich in these
kinds of foods and lower risk of things
[SPEAKER_01]: like cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all ties together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the old adage, you are what you
eat, has a lot of merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: From when we've talked in the past about
the entourage effect and flavonoids being
[SPEAKER_00]: part of what's important, of what we're
getting out of cannabis, are we
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially saying that we're getting some
of the essential parts that support the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system just from another
source that's not cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting non-cannabis flavonoids
and it supports the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still looking at those
relationships, but clearly having
[SPEAKER_01]: bioflavonoids in the diet is going to be
an advantage overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to read Dr. Russo's paper
on this topic, you can go ahead and find
[SPEAKER_00]: the link in the first comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
