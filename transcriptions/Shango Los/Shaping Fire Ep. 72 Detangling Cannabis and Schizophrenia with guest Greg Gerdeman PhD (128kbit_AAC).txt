[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who have been defending and
teaching about cannabis for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's often difficult to let any argument
stand that suggests that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: anything short of a perfect wonder herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while cannabis is a wonder herb,
it's also true that, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, there's still a lot we don't
know about the cannabis plant and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: acts on the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, politicians, law
enforcement, pharmaceutical companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and concerned parent types have used this
absence of research to promote cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: fears that are not based on evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these ideas is that cannabis use
causes psychotic breaks, and there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and schizophrenia don't appear to
be totally unrelated either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the science we have, it is a
complex understanding and not the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing easily discussed casually in a
Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are to really understand the
relationship between psychosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use, we need a gently considered
long-form answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to that discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used CBG-dominant cannabis
flower, tincture, and other preparations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last six months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Russo asked me to let you know
that he and others are conducting a study
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine the benefits and drawbacks to
kanabagirol and they would love your
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questionnaire takes about 10 minutes
and can be anonymous if you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study is available at bit
.ly//cbgstudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bit.ly//cbgstudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the link is in the notes for this
episode on shapingfire.com too.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is neuroscientist,
Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Gerdeman has joined me on Shaping
Fire before way back on episode 14 to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss synthetic cannabinoids and then
again on episode 46 to discuss exercise,
[SPEAKER_00]: athleticism, and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg's work has been highlighted
throughout cannabis media and in crossover
[SPEAKER_00]: publications like Science, National
Geographic, and the New York Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: His scholarly research has spanned topics
ranging from the synaptic physiology of
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system, behavioral
pharmacology of CB1 receptors and their
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of habitual memories,
the physiological activation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system signaling and
exercise, and the evolutionary and
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative biology of cannabinoid
receptors through studies on Inverterate
[SPEAKER_00]: Marine Cordates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally great scientific work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg has also consulted for a handful of
nationally recognizable cannabis brands
[SPEAKER_00]: helping them develop medicinal cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we will be detangling schizophrenia
and cannabis use and teasing them apart to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a clearer understanding of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Greg, we read in major media
the assertion that cannabis causes
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia and psychosis, but you know,
for most of us, those are like buzzwords
[SPEAKER_00]: without very much basis in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you start us off by describing
schizophrenia first and then psychosis so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can have a better grasp on what
we're even learning about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give that a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complicated, you know, for one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are descriptions of mental
experience and mental illness that,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, we certainly understand now
exist on a continuum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like many other situations of
psychiatric or neurological disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like something real simple like,
hey, your blood sugar is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schizophrenia is a complex disorder of
really characterized by disordered thought
[SPEAKER_01]: and symptoms of disordered thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that sounds like a broad net,
again, it's covering a broad array of
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me be clear that I'm not a
neurologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like clinical diagnoses change
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't be the most cutting edge
person than necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wouldn't diagnose someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that disclaimer aside, schizophrenia
is characterized by imbalances and a lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of control over ordered thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, there are different levels
of severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also two major clusters that
have classically been described of
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenic or psychotic-like symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So schizophrenia falls into a kind of
psychosis, which, again, is sort of an
[SPEAKER_01]: imbalanced, you know, disturbed thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schizophrenia symptoms classically get
divided into what are called positive
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms and negative symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the negative tends to, in many cases,
come on first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people say negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're bad and positive ones are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It refers to mental experience sort of
being absent when it should be there or
[SPEAKER_01]: present when it shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is, well,
maybe I could start with the positive
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms first because that includes
things like hallucinations and paranoid
[SPEAKER_01]: ideations, you know, paranoid conspiracies
that go on in the mind or thinking that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are imagining, if you will,
or sensing reality that isn't objectively
[SPEAKER_01]: there to the rest of us, you know,
a total auditory hallucination of someone
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking to you when nobody else has any
evidence that there's someone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of hallucination is a positive
symptom because something is layering on
[SPEAKER_01]: to your conscious experience that is not
objectively there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the negative symptoms that
are more like apathy, which is related to
[SPEAKER_01]: not having motivation, anhedonia,
or lack of, you know, feeling,
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasure, and blunt affect, where you're
just flat, a flat sort of facial
[SPEAKER_01]: expression, a loss of emotional
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does that get us to work as an
introduction to what schizophrenia and
[SPEAKER_01]: psychosis are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never considered the positive and
the negative aspects, but as you describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it, yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the positive ones, the disordered
thoughts are creating things that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: objectively there in the outside world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the negative ones are like some
sort of lack of action, a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: participation, a lack of expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you earlier, when you use the
term disordered thoughts, would these
[SPEAKER_00]: positive and negative schizophrenic
symptoms be considered disordered
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are generally considered disordered
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the extreme psychosis,
you asked me where that fits in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, psychosis is a more general
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily part of
schizophrenia, but it is a severe mental
[SPEAKER_01]: condition or disorder where thought and
emotions are so, call them disordered or
[SPEAKER_01]: impaired that, that the person is sort of
lost from external reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are, you are in your own world and
that's where a state of psychosis is
[SPEAKER_01]: referred to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but some of that, that can be,
obviously that's a disordering of sorts,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least it makes sense to call it
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about something more mundane like
blunt affect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the way I liken it,
and this isn't meant to be a textbook
[SPEAKER_01]: definition, but more my, you know,
what's coming out of my way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should say, you know, when I started
grad school 25 years ago, started going
[SPEAKER_01]: into neurosciences and interested in
schizophrenia and finding, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic outcomes to help
schizophrenia, discovering something,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was a big motivation to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had interest in this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so part of my speculation,
my conjecture, um, when someone,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even just being a teenager is
sometimes associated with being blunt
[SPEAKER_01]: affect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever I'm gloomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think in the, in the situation
we're talking about, this can come about
[SPEAKER_01]: because of a disconnect between like
yourself and future self, like making the
[SPEAKER_01]: association between what I want to do and
where my hopes of where I want to be are
[SPEAKER_01]: or what my plan is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or maybe just not feeling the,
uh, a joy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you could probably nitpick
about whether this is a disorganized
[SPEAKER_01]: thought or just something that's not
really well wired or connected in a
[SPEAKER_01]: productive way, but they are certainly all
symptoms that come together in diagnoses
[SPEAKER_01]: of schizophrenia, which progress into more
and more severe conditions where the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual does become psychotic,
where this combination of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called negative symptoms and not
feeling or expressing normal, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: emotions and, and sensations combine with
experiencing things that really aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: there to just create massive confusion
that becomes an agitation from that
[SPEAKER_01]: confusion that becomes sort of the
hallmark of you know, madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the names for these things have
changed many times over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, schizophrenic illness is a,
you get various levels of severity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the popular thinking is one of
madness, insanity, sometimes violent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, insanity, but not always
sometimes just utterly withdrawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes complex, you know, the
brilliant mind kind of, um, reality where
[SPEAKER_01]: someone, um, in a fixation with
understanding patterns in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually interesting because our
whole conversation is couched around
[SPEAKER_01]: conspiracies and making patterns in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes that is in a very
leads to extremely brilliant outcomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mathematical insights, um, in someone who
is otherwise incapable of functioning
[SPEAKER_01]: except being utterly withdrawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: from the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's a, it's a really fascinating
terrain of the human brain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have, here I go into it being an
evolutionary neurobiologist, but we evolve
[SPEAKER_01]: these utterly miraculous cognating brains,
you know, which were clearly evolved in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in humans because it made us successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are able to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a recipe for planning and success
and reproduction and it led to agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: and architecture and culture and,
uh, so many aspects of what it means to be
[SPEAKER_01]: human, but it kind of has these traces of
what makes us sometimes neurotic about not
[SPEAKER_01]: only being able to figure things out,
but being driven to have to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one way this manifests in both
subtle and sometimes really neurotic ways
[SPEAKER_01]: is seeing patterns that aren't necessarily
there and getting convinced by them,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a theory of a global cabal
controlling everything with the flip of a
[SPEAKER_01]: switch or, um, other things like,
you know, my teenager wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: happened like this if he hadn't
experimented with that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really remarkable how, uh,
it's, it's pretty startling actually to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to you describe the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia and how similar
[SPEAKER_00]: they sound to clinical depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you're describing this range
from, you know, some amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia and some slight expression
of the symptoms all the way up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, violent outbursts and people
becoming, you know, unhinged with reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got to think that there's a lot
of people in the, um, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, on the, on the less obvious side
where it looks like depression that are
[SPEAKER_00]: undiagnosed for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and of course then you get in the
world, the world of comorbidities,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, when the diagnosis
seemed to have both diagnoses,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and there's lots of overlap in these,
in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's someone in, in my sphere right
now that is dealing with being diagnosed
[SPEAKER_01]: with schizophrenia, but he's like,
no, I'm bipolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and I certainly over the
years, sometimes, I mean, I try to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: deliberate in what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the last thing I want to do is
create stigma towards people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: struggles with their mental health,
whether it's depression or schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and you know, but at risk of
going down a tangent, which we won't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I go so far as to, you know,
really follow people's thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: cognitive liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just because someone has a,
I mean, people can be functional
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenics if their surroundings and
community, you know, and, and vocation
[SPEAKER_01]: allows them to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, that, that could go down a
little wormhole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it, it, there's similarities for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I've never been a medical
doctor and I have empathy for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for psychiatrists when they have a
balancing act like this and in figuring
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, and putting a name to
things there again, our underlying human
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroses, we've got to put names to
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and molecular psychiatry,
meaning, you know, since the advent of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical drugs that, you know,
have useful roles in, in psychiatry,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, well, it's changed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on the one side, it's made things
kind of, um, a medicine bowl approach like
[SPEAKER_01]: here, try this pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it has an effect, that'll influence
my diagnosis as of what we've learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and then we can go, you can go
back to the very first antipsychotics like
[SPEAKER_01]: Thorazine that came out in the fifties and
sixties that, um, that, that had a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: social impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there, there was a mindset,
Hey, we don't have to have homes for the
[SPEAKER_01]: mentally insane anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and so those sort of sanitariums
and inpatient mental health facilities are
[SPEAKER_01]: now sort of historical vestiges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and of course there were horrific
things that happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: lobotomies and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, it wasn't really a
golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the many, many homeless people
are schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them end up on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, it's a very complex issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that schizophrenia is
complicated and there are many ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: simplify it, including the idea that,
you know, there's some simple trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia typically when it gets more
serious happens in the late teens to mid
[SPEAKER_01]: to late twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there is very often a
precipitating kind of event and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: been observed that, you know, without
being cued to go further into our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, I mean, associations have
been observed scientifically that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people who are precipitated into
having a psychotic event that turns into
[SPEAKER_01]: more manifest schizophrenia have
experimented with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, smoking tobacco is statistically
associated with a greater likelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of psych of, of developing schizophrenia
going to college is more statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to lead to a psychotic event that
turns into schizophrenia, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but nobody talks about, you know,
banning kids from college.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of, uh, someone and whether
we'll get into much of this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we go on to the hour, but someone who
may already, you know, be, be disposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia, experiencing that strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those other causalities are,
uh, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never mentioned and we will go,
we will go into that more, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we, before we go into that,
um, now that we've established what
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia is, this kind of,
this basket of attributes, both positive
[SPEAKER_00]: and negative attributes, things that we
see that don't exist and then ways that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should express ourselves that we're not,
they're all in this big basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's, let's look at a different
basket and that basket is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what people experience when they,
they over medicate, you know, most people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have used cannabis at some point or
another have had that experience of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: too high of a dose of THC and feeling like
they're coming unhinged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with it myself, paranoia,
situational hallucinations about what is
[SPEAKER_00]: and is not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes freestanding hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a really big dose and it
eventually goes away as the body
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd love for you to clarify,
Greg, or what are these over medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences in medical terms and are these
moments of psychosis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, THC is a
profoundly powerful substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I flash back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some to being a college professor and,
um, you know, the secret was pretty well
[SPEAKER_01]: known that I was the pot guy, you know,
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so a lot of kids,
a lot of students in the college would
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like therefore I was a safe person to
open up to on their experience of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the classic experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Amsterdam, I tried a cookie and
it wasn't hitting me an hour later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ate two more and those, those edible
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are, you know, the classic ways to get
into that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, uh, frankly, I learned this
from our mutual friend, Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that clinicians will refer to
that state of having way too much and
[SPEAKER_01]: being in that place as a toxic psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that a psychosis being completely,
like I mentioned, you know, separated,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're kind of out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, you're way out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, in your own mental state and your
own mental bubble and by saying toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: psychosis, meaning it's brought on by a
toxin in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that cannabis people,
sometimes myself included can be averse to
[SPEAKER_01]: calling THC a toxin, but it takes you to a
place you don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Hey, it always stands to,
to mention that the reason why we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: so, uh, enamored with cannabis is because
of all the good things it can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that even in these worst case
scenarios, you're going to wake up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and be over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it, it can be called a toxic
psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this happens with other substances,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, amphetamine and cocaine
likewise can create a very different kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of psychosis, which in the case of
amphetamines, um, is I've been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned this when I was taking med
school classes as part of my graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: training that an amphetamine induced
psychosis from taking way too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, speed used to call it,
uh, adderall, what, uh, other kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: amphetamines in an emergency room setting,
that's indistinguishable from someone
[SPEAKER_01]: having a paranoid schizophrenic psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and indeed there's a whole
dopamine hypothesis of, of why amphetamine
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulate dopamine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's in the drugs, many of the
drugs that are therapeutic for
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenic patients for, uh,
that illness are blockers of those drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to confound them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're very different experiences
going way too far on THC than going,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, overdosing on an amphetamine,
but they both can be called psychosis that
[SPEAKER_01]: are triggered by, uh, by another
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is interesting how if we go back to
the, the positive and negative
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenic, um, symptom definitions,
you know, take, let's take a, a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a minor negative, which would be for
example, like the lack of expression on
[SPEAKER_00]: your face, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there, you know, there are,
it is not uncommon for somebody to have so
[SPEAKER_00]: much THC that they're that their facial
expression is, is checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so stoned, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and at that point, you know,
um, you know, they would, they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: showing evidence of, of schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and certainly if we go on the
positive attributes, like seeing things
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't there or, uh, in my
experience, um, imagining situations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are happening that are not right,
which, which from, um, your definition I
[SPEAKER_00]: think would, would fit as a positive
symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think we've all been in a
situation where like, wait, is this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this thing happening the way I think it
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, more often than not,
you know, you totally are misinterpreting
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation, but it's, it's a type of
hallucination I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, Well, and it's important,
you know, clinically, and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, okay, I've said the
disclaimer enough, I'm not a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor, but you know, the, before someone
could be diagnosed with schizophrenia,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there needs to be, you know,
it's recognized that many of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: are, are real phenomena that we all
experience at different places in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, imagination, creativity is
involves imagining things that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and being, you know, distracted in
your thoughts is not in and itself a
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, and so that there's just
a disclaimer there, but you, you bring up
[SPEAKER_01]: an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I didn't interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I liked the way you were saying how
getting stoned can lead to a blunting of
[SPEAKER_01]: affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do tend to think in many of those
cases, it's because you're in your head,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or in the ways that cannabis sort of
can take you out of the temporal moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you've lost track of time and
you're just sort of there and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and being, and I sometimes, and this goes
into my own conjecture, but I think people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are, um, experiencing it as part of a
mental condition, that may be something
[SPEAKER_01]: more, um, like a schizophrenic or someone
who's prodromal going to be schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the blunt affect can,
it may be that there's an inability to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of want to feel where you're at or
plan the future, or maybe it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: rumination going in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something similar to cannabis,
um, in particular THC, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: also sort of taking you out of your head
and, and being blunt like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe, maybe that's, um, part of why
schizophrenics can find cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them a sort of a ease and a
comfort in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there again, as a subject,
I know we're going to talk about a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's overlap and there's sort of
this, there's, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go into this in this, you know,
um, essay I wrote for Project CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the, the link, the accusation of
reefer madness, that, that cannabis leads
[SPEAKER_01]: to madness, to schizophrenia, that it is a
trigger, you know, a little time bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of metaphors that are
used to drive this association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, part of the reason it's, why it's
successful is there is a sort of face
[SPEAKER_01]: value validity that you have to realize
that, that cannabis is a, is a powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are aspects of it that will look
to the nonuser as being, as, as sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: traits with symptoms of disordered
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, smoking cannabis does take your
thought out of the normal order then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that doesn't mean it's the same
kind of situation of schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you've brought up the talk,
what I've called the toxic psychosis of a
[SPEAKER_01]: going way too far on THC, you know,
THC overdose as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that even, you know, someone who
experiments with, with cannabis and goes
[SPEAKER_01]: too far, may come away from it saying,
yeah, it made me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at the article that,
uh, journalists more endowed wrote a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago that famously, you know,
she decided to just way over indulge in
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles and wrote about it as a horror
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to the marijuana tax act,
that really was the major piece in this
[SPEAKER_01]: age of cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hopefully are, we, that we are coming
out of, um, you know, one of the powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: testimonies that supported criminalizing
marijuana, aside from the fact that they
[SPEAKER_01]: threw the name marijuana on it,
um, was, was a, um, a psych psychologist
[SPEAKER_01]: from temple university who, who testified
that he, uh, used, I forget if he smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: it or ate it or he used cannabis and that
he turned into a bat and flew around the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't say, I imagine that he said like
on the congressional record that he turned
[SPEAKER_01]: into a bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, here's someone who clearly,
if he didn't have some ulterior motive,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you take him as believable,
he nonetheless had a really disturbing
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we, you know, we as humans tend
to look for simple explanations and
[SPEAKER_01]: science is really not different from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly politics and, and rulership
isn't, you come up with a simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, an explanation like, Hey, I
experienced this really out of my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it, that somebody could go
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I wasn't going to come out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if that's true?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if sometimes you never come out of it
and you stay there forever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a certain level where you
gotta sympathize with where people could
[SPEAKER_01]: come to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when we look at ancient history,
you know, those of us who are really
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis buffs, have enjoyed learning from
some of our, some research into ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we, I mean, it's, it's really
informative that humans have used cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutically and as a sacrament since
before human written history.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also some of those early texts that
refer to cannabis as medicine and what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you make reference to them as to
cannabis, as being like a substance that
[SPEAKER_01]: takes you out of your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this isn't new, you know, that,
that we have a recognition that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can cause, um, serious impact to your
mental state, but you come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, it's what we're going
there for in the first place, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, um, one of the challenging
aspects with this particular topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, and why I so appreciate both the
tone you took in your article for Project
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and just, you know, how you are as a
scientist overall is that so much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis media and, and, and, you know,
in stone or family and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, me included, we, we want,
we're so used to being on the defensive
[SPEAKER_00]: from the taboo reefer madness people
saying that cannabis is so terrible and
[SPEAKER_00]: will just destroy your life that it puts
us in a position to kind of be reactive to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, to, to react to it, their gross
hyperbole of how bad it is by,
[SPEAKER_00]: by kind of taking our own hyperbole and
saying there is, you know, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: flawless, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's nothing that could
possibly wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know what, I don't even feel
comfortable using the word wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there, there are certainly parts,
there are certainly experiences that I and
[SPEAKER_00]: others have with cannabis which was not
necessarily the intention and are
[SPEAKER_00]: dysphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and generally as humans, we,
we want to avoid dysphoria and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it feels like so much, so many of us
in cannabis, we feel constrained from
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some of those less
attractive aspects of cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really afraid that, that the,
the prohibition folks will like grab on
[SPEAKER_00]: that little thing that we say and say,
aha, see, here is the evidence that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: the absolute worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, no, all we're saying is
that if you get too high, it really sucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which is, which is not
hyperbolic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and so it pushes us to not say
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons why I
appreciate the shaping fire audience
[SPEAKER_00]: because the shaping fire audience can make
that delineation, you know, the folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to this show are you know,
pretty reliable thinkers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, oh, I get,
I get this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that there can be some parts of
cannabis, which are less attractive to me
[SPEAKER_00]: without the opposite being true and that
it's a demonic drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, um, we're going to go to
commercial break right now, but when we
[SPEAKER_00]: come back, that is where we're going to
start with this idea of reverse causality
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that just because there are some of
these attributes that, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that we don't like does not mean
that, uh, the inverse is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then we're going to take a
look at, um, how the, the nature of our
[SPEAKER_00]: country is set up that, that reinforces
this reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is neuroscientist,
Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner

[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is an essential plant nutrient and
keeping sufficient dissolved oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia's brand of ultra-fine nanobubble
systems will help your garden thrive in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you may not have considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you grow in soil,
hydroponics or aquaponics, Gaia's
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra-fine nanobubble systems will
increase your dissolved oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, the first sign of inadequate oxygen
supply to the roots is wilting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant under warm conditions and high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: High light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insufficient oxygen results in an
accumulation of toxins and an insufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of water and mineral absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: If oxygen starvation continues,
mineral deficiencies will begin to show,
[SPEAKER_00]: roots die back, and plants will become
stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy roots supplied with sufficient
oxygen are able to absorb nutrient ions
[SPEAKER_00]: selectively from the surrounding solution
as required.
[SPEAKER_00]: In studies, this has shown a 30% increase
in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do ultra-fine oxygen bubbles
allow your plants to thrive, but they will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your drip lines and irrigation pipes
and plumbing clean too, because algae,
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium, and other invasive species only
survive in low oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Gaia system only costs about $2
per day to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia ultra-fine oxygen nanobubblers are
also great for making compost teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-crafted nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller bubbles of truly dissolved
oxygen allow more microbes to reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Gaia's website at h205.com to learn
more about using dissolved oxygen and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to purchase this simple yet amazing
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's h205.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is neuroscientist,
Greg Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, during the first set,
we set up what schizophrenia and psychosis
[SPEAKER_00]: are, the baskets of attributes that they
tend to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked a lot about what it's
like to over-medicate on THC, and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely found some similarities
between the two, but it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: one necessarily causes the other or is
even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this happen historically in the
press, and how the general population
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like cannabis, never so obviously as
when there is some sort of psychotic crime
[SPEAKER_00]: or murder or something, and they find out
that the individual who committed the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime was a cannabis user or used cannabis
earlier in their life, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly tie these psychotic breaks to the
actual crime, which of course was very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful during the height of the
Prohibition and Reefer Madness days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you have studied this in
depth, so would you kind of summarize how
[SPEAKER_00]: that has happened and that phenomenon in
the media of taking these folks who commit
[SPEAKER_00]: these crimes and dumping all of that at
the feet of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will try to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it goes in line with thinking of
it as a conspiracy theory in that a story
[SPEAKER_01]: has been told that the reefer causes
madness, and when that story is out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a believability to it and a
desire to believe it for ulterior motives
[SPEAKER_01]: and what have you, it's snowballed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you get something that can be
seen as a piece of evidence, and you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned that it was instrumental in
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly was, and there's a very
specific case that I came to find out
[SPEAKER_01]: about because I was living down in St.
Pete, Florida, and this case happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ybor City in Tampa in the 1930s,
early 1930s, this fella named Victor
[SPEAKER_01]: Lakata.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a terribly troubled young man,
and it's a horrible story.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy became an axe murderer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He killed his entire family, his parents,
his siblings, and it became a cause celebs
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of publicized face because it was
said that he was a marijuana addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police found, in some way,
I mean, I don't remember all the details,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the police had like a marijuana
cigarette and said he had been addicted to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking marijuana cigarettes for like six
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was, as these things happened,
picked up by powerful figures like Harry
[SPEAKER_01]: Anslinger, who was probably the most,
well, was the most important driving force
[SPEAKER_01]: in that Prohibition, and he became the
face of the drug-crazed, murderous madman,
[SPEAKER_01]: the marijuana dope fiend.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these pejorative terms got created
justified by an individual case of
[SPEAKER_01]: shocking horror value, an absolute
tragedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as historians have looked back at that
case, and I think it happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't take too long for it to happen,
that it was recognized that this person
[SPEAKER_01]: had a history, a pre-existing history of
disturbing mental illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, he never did time for that crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was institutionalized for his psychosis
because he was considered unfit to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was diagnosed at the time what was
called dementia precox with homicidal
[SPEAKER_01]: tendencies, but it was called that some
kind of a powerful psychotic
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's worth noting, so he was
committed to the hospital of the insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a family history of severe mental
illness, like an uncle, his parents had
[SPEAKER_01]: some insanity in their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents were actually first cousins of
one another, and during his time at the
[SPEAKER_01]: mental institution, the records never
really focused on saying that marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: use had any cause in his condition,
but that creates such a graphic story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became very powerfully associated with
a drug that was not well known,
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not as marijuana, in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped to propel cannabis into the
prohibited status when it was effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: banned by the Marijuana Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: These kinds of things do go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, at the top of my head,
have a more graphic example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may not be another example as
important, but there are elements of that
[SPEAKER_01]: that still continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I was in Florida a few
years ago, there was a case of the guy who
[SPEAKER_01]: was caught by police trying to eat the
face of another man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was completely psychotically deranged.
[SPEAKER_01]: The media had a field day without any
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, at least for a brief period of
time, blamed on marijuana because of a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug tox that this guy had THC in his
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had also been ingesting some of these
powerful bath salts that are intensely
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive and certainly can lead to
severe psychotic behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: The notion that it was linked to cannabis
at all was ridiculous, but it serves what
[SPEAKER_01]: has been a political will to support the
theory, the mindset, the fallacy that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis creates, schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of ways that I think these
theories get supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I've said you've got to have some
face value believability to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, for something like the
conspiracy of reframanists, I think there
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to be certain ulterior motives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, Anslinger had ulterior motives.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on a crusade against Satanism,
which he associated with jazz music and
[SPEAKER_01]: their reefers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was racist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another insidious ulterior motive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the bulk of the country doesn't know
anything about marijuana and it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: colored as something that is associated
with the ethnic minorities that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to blame for something, there are
ulterior motives that get these things set
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a story gets so heavily
institutionalized that marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_01]: slippery slope to madness, it's one of the
ways that cannabis hijacks your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are vested interests in just not
being wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, the prison industry and law
enforcement doesn't want to be wrong with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinicians have come to think that that's
how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to believe that they've
been wrong about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash forward to the last 20, 30 years,
the funding structure for research into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has all been biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: For many years, it was very perniciously
biased towards you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really going to study marijuana
unless you're proposing to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a presupposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the world of brain sciences,
that was, I'm going to conduct
[SPEAKER_01]: university-based research to show how
cannabis leads to the use of other drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: or how you get addicted to it like you do
other drugs or how it leads to insanity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was never really based on a
scientific argument or scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, it gets institutionalized and
sheltered by a scientific paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's become this cultural
prejudice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was posited at one point and people
jumped on it and started repeating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That suddenly became the status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everybody fell in behind that status
quo because either A, it was convenient
[SPEAKER_00]: and useful to them, or B, there was not
good reason for somebody to stand against
[SPEAKER_00]: this wave of belief in this cultural
prejudice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The history is just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many fascinating things about
cannabis, whether it's scientifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: social, cultural.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned how this reefer madness
mythology and this axe murderer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: testimony from the Professor Munch who
said he turned into a bat, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things drove prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one voice that was standing out
against the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937 was
[SPEAKER_01]: the American Medical Association saying,
wait, you're characterizing this reefer in
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that cannabis is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got great potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the convergence of World War II
and everything else going on, and how
[SPEAKER_01]: successful Anslinger was with literally
going to these apothecaries and smashing
[SPEAKER_01]: it up, destroying all of the bottles of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was removed from the pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed our cultural memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get into the situation where
there's a story that's been repeated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a certain face value to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are horror stories that you just
don't want to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's associated with a counterculture or
with racial minorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me coming into this, I came to
cannabis as a brain scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it wasn't because I wanted to study
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more because I wanted to study
these intersections of the mind and the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain and when they go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has been said, rightly so,
a lot will be said for many years to come
[SPEAKER_01]: about how the research bias has existed
that's made it so hard to study cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many ways we can go into that,
but one of them is the fact that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: research has been so monopolized,
so to speak, by the drug abuse arm of the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole paradigm that you're studying it
as a problem and trying to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: it can damage the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the beautiful fun ironies is that
research led to show that it protects the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis acts on an endocannabinoid system
that is fundamentally part of our brain's
[SPEAKER_01]: neuroprotective system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fallacy in that level that cannabis
damages the brain has just been completely
[SPEAKER_01]: debunked and reversed, but the fallacy
that it leads to insanity still kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: lingers and big grant dollars are still
reserved and or go to applying new tools
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask the same questions like really
sophisticated brain imaging methods to say
[SPEAKER_01]: what's different in the fine granular,
you know, tracts of the brain if someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: experience experimenting with cannabis and
there have been papers that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: splashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a whole talk on this over the
years that there have been papers that
[SPEAKER_01]: really hit the media like, whoa,
the verdict is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke cannabis, it changes your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it because we can see it in these
super powerful magnet scanners,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of those studies find these very
small changes in structures of the brain
[SPEAKER_01]: without correlating it to any functional
deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of this institutionalized
story, the deficit can be inferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in a scientific paper,
you're writing an article in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: will most, you know, be accepted by the
funding structures and tell the story that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been trying to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are, I mean, and I don't like to
discredit or be harsh on scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I see these places where some
difference in the brain structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very small difference, not something
that a neurologist could point out on
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the brain scan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have computer algorithms say,
hey, there's a slight difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: volume of the left amygdala in someone
who's been using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that difference is interpreted as
damage or compensation for damage,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gets really pretty ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greg, I would like to change the,
I don't know, maybe the vocabulary of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we go next for a moment,
because one of the things that I so enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, you know, you can teach things
very, very effectively in a common folk
[SPEAKER_00]: language because, you know, you've been a
professor and you've been teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: students and people for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I also know you as a research
scientist and have heard you get like
[SPEAKER_00]: super nerdy and you do both in this recent
article for Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to ask you to
describe is this idea of reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: causality, capital R, capital C,
in its scientific terms, because up till
[SPEAKER_00]: now in this set, we have hit the nail
pretty hard that this idea of having too
[SPEAKER_00]: much THC giving this dysphoric experience
has similarities with schizophrenia and
[SPEAKER_00]: how historical criminals who had some
connection to marijuana were then used as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like scapegoats or patsies for
this political, racial position that
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there is a very
specific logical premise that fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the studies that try to support these
taboos of reaper madness, they fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science itself fails to prove the
point that cannabis will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia and psychotic breaks in
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to go down this path
too far, but for those folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: really into the forensic nature of the
science, if you would describe reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: causality and why the reaper madness fails
on this very important standard of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, I think that that would be
tasty.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just that there are
associations made in the popular press and
[SPEAKER_01]: the shock stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been correlations observed in
scientific studies between cohorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are schizophrenic and cohorts
of people who are not, and finding that
[SPEAKER_01]: those who develop schizophrenia were
slightly more likely to have used cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to that, earlier in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, almost all of these are sort of
these retrospective studies that are set
[SPEAKER_01]: up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you find a clinical population.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one that had impact was a group
of army soldiers in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took a group of them that had been
diagnosed with schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you set up, you try to find an
equally sized group that's similar and
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you ask the question, well,
was cannabis use different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these kinds of situations have looked
back and said, well, there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is always looking for correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's often said that correlation does
not prove causation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets a lot harder to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we want to ask the question of,
does it cause it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there have been multiple studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this gets very politicized
and it's why it's important for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis culture and industry to not just
dismiss this because there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: considerable body of science that says the
diagnosis of schizophrenia is correlated
[SPEAKER_01]: with a greater likelihood of having
experimented or being a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more often than a heavy cannabis
user.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gets flipped around into saying
that heavy cannabis use is therefore a
[SPEAKER_01]: risk factor for contracting schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: This starts to imply causation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis use is a risk factor when
really rigorously, the statistics of it
[SPEAKER_01]: just mean that they are associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And several studies have in more recent
years, when I think that the bias and even
[SPEAKER_01]: the scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: bravery to challenge assumptions has
arisen, people have taken very close looks
[SPEAKER_01]: at this and tried to tease out where there
could be family history involved or other
[SPEAKER_01]: confounds, as we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make a correlation, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be due to other factors like the
weed smokers came from a different
[SPEAKER_01]: background, a different socioeconomic
background than the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that maybe was leading to the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some studies, socioeconomic background
is a compound that's not well controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Family genetics is certainly one that has
been hard to track down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in the last 10 years or so,
it's become much more the abilities to
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence DNA have led to so much insight
into the human genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get these powerful genome-wide
association studies that are able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's keep it a little simple and say,
just categorize people's genetic history
[SPEAKER_01]: more carefully and qualify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least two, there are two particular
studies that really looked well at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many studies have said, well, there may be
a confound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are studies that show like
identical twins, the cannabis use,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's identical twins that are
discordant for cannabis use, one uses and
[SPEAKER_01]: one doesn't, it doesn't really pan out
that the cannabis user is more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: get schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there have been a couple of studies
that have indicated that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that yeah, we too see a correlation and
that there is a risk associating heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use with schizophrenia,
but that it seems to be connected to
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic markers, meaning that there's a
genetic similarity to people who,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a more strong driver in these
studies that wasn't necessarily obvious,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that if you look at the genetic
markers, there's a stronger drive to the
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenic associate, cannabis
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this does get delicate,
difficult to talk about, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically very accepted and rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it points to is the idea that
cannabis users, I mean, there are people
[SPEAKER_01]: with latent sort of predisposition to
schizophrenia that may be more inclined to
[SPEAKER_01]: use cannabis heavily prior to being
diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this isn't a new idea,
but it's fairly new research has been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to test it well using modern genomic
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've talked about this negative
and positive symptoms to begin the first
[SPEAKER_01]: set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, I mean, schizophrenia very often
is associated with what's called a
[SPEAKER_01]: prodrome or prodromal patient or prodromal
schizophrenia, meaning it's been long
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized that individuals can suffer
from those negative symptoms of blunt
[SPEAKER_01]: affect and anedonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets identified in them prior to
actually having a psychotic break from
[SPEAKER_01]: reality and becoming diagnosed with more
manifest schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there are latent
individuals that are latently predisposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start to experience the prodrome
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And studies have shown that, well,
I get a little confused about what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying with what studies have and haven't
shown, those prodromal patients tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: have negative symptoms first.
[SPEAKER_01]: A study that I cite out of Australia in my
article found, and it was not the only
[SPEAKER_01]: one, that it found that schizophrenic
patients do self-medicate with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's primarily to alleviate negative
symptoms by self-report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could give some of my conjecture
about why that might be, but the users
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves say, yeah, I'm smoking to
medicate, and it helps to alleviate these
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of not feeling connected to my
feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question of reverse causality is an
important one and helps to explain the
[SPEAKER_01]: confounds between environment and genetics
and this association.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that triggered my article in my
little essay in Project CBD, I've thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about these things for many years,
but I actually, you know, the other night
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were all anxiously thinking about
counting ballots and the election returns
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can't get your mind off anything
else, and in my inbox dropped this new
[SPEAKER_01]: table of contents from JAMA Psychiatry,
the Journal of the American Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: Association psychiatry publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had this brand new study that is a
breakdown by these authors Gillespie and
[SPEAKER_01]: Kindler, two different I have no
affiliation or don't know them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they wrote what I consider a really
elegant review and statistical re-analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: of studies looking at the question of
causality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, they reviewed the
literature, they looked at these,
[SPEAKER_01]: including studies that, you know,
concluded there was reverse causality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but their paper, again, that's brand new,
asked the question, they said,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's consider that there are three
hypotheses Hypothesis one, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's been kind of traditionally
ingrained is that cannabis is causal for
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like putting a match where there
would not otherwise be a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my words, not theirs,
but that, you know, cannabis is a risk
[SPEAKER_01]: that will make someone turn schizophrenic
who otherwise would not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothesis two is that it's complicated by
confounding factors and that someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics may be predisposing them and
cannabis use could kind of tip the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hypothesis three was that it's a
completely reverse sort of thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, I mean, that only if you're
schizophrenic do you use cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, you know, there's no real
connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they found in a nutshell,
I mean, I direct people to the article in
[SPEAKER_01]: my Project CBDSA, is that the hypothesis
one is completely out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studies that have found evidence for
reverse causality, which were published in
[SPEAKER_01]: very good journals, very good science,
are compelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did a fresh statistical breakdown
that I won't try to explain about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: data point to the fact that studies
showing increased use of cannabis leads to
[SPEAKER_01]: a greater risk of psychosis are greatly
overstating the relationship that the
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse causality may actually be the case
for, and for the kind of reasons that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: embellished here, that someone who is
already likely to become schizophrenic or
[SPEAKER_01]: at greater risk because of their genes,
because of how their brain is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: wired up throughout your teenage and
twenties years, schizophrenia is a risk
[SPEAKER_01]: for that person, say with a family
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person may be more likely to
enjoy cannabis and getting into a habitual
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a statistical association that
is actually in the reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being someone that is, because of your,
the nature of your genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, are going down a path towards
a schizophrenia, that that more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: pushes them or influences them to be ever
so slightly more likely to be a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: user.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is so interesting that simply
because people who may be experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: early life mental challenges turn to
cannabis for comfort could actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: misread as being the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of this hyperbole and reefer
madness culture has come from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go into that, let's go ahead and
take our last break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll all be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and our
guest this week is neuroscientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Erdemann.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Lowes Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Lowes and join our
[SPEAKER_00]: online community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Lowes YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_00]: Sigmund's lecture, Understanding Your
Endocannabinoid System, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland Nursery talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy Canole's Lost Art of the
Hashishian presentation, Nicholas Mamoud
[SPEAKER_00]: on regenerative and polyculture cannabis
growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlaski and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to youtube.com forward slash
shangolows or click on the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to interview you,
you can go to www.shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also click the link in our
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is neuroscientist, Greg
[SPEAKER_00]: Gerdeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right before the break, Greg,
you were telling us about the Gillespie
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kendler study and what it was showing
the fact that folks who turned to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for comfort because they were experiencing
some mental challenges then got conflated
[SPEAKER_00]: and were seen as it being the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also bring up in your project CBD
article how other data points kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: miraculously appear in the science that
are not actually supported by science,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they become the default setting like
this belief that cannabis causes madness
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one that you point out is the
10% THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're starting to see
suggestions like we did two years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a lot of states say, yes,
we will have legal cannabis, but we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD only, which of course, that's just
playing into fears and not at all based on
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that cannabis that would be sold
in recreational stores should not be more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 10%, it also has got a questionable
genesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure where it first
appeared, but there has been a real thrust
[SPEAKER_01]: that I saw in the state of Florida to
identify this 10% level as where THC
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the cannabis culture in the
industry is very quick to dismiss this,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, it's just more prohibitionist talk,
but people were pointing to a publication
[SPEAKER_01]: in a very prestigious journal,
The Lancet, Lancet Psychiatry,
[SPEAKER_01]: that said this is all based in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to follow the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we do have to look at the
science and be able to address it on its
[SPEAKER_01]: real terms and not just turn that over to
those who are making a counter-argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the notion is that there's been a long
connection with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all been hearing for years that
today's cannabis isn't your daddy's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to make something actionable,
there's a statement that 10% THC is too
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuel that people were pointing to was
this article in The Lancet that had a
[SPEAKER_01]: great deal of prestige to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a multi-center study in numerous
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It put itself as a study across Europe,
but it also included Brazil and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: another Latin American country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was primarily led by a group in
London that is one of the most productive
[SPEAKER_01]: groups that have published over the years
again and again, this notion that strong
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, the skunk, leads to psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really are only a handful of labs
that have put the most of that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This study, what it did, I'll break down
how it was designed, it basically
[SPEAKER_01]: recruited into the study clinics from
various different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this adds to the prestige of the
article because there are lots of authors
[SPEAKER_01]: on it from different countries and they've
got funding from their national institutes
[SPEAKER_01]: of health or research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get this byline that's
enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, in legislature
committees, a lot of times that's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: influential thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was published by all these
important people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they did is they recruited
clinics and clinicians within them so that
[SPEAKER_01]: when someone showed up with a first
episode psychotic psychosis, that they
[SPEAKER_01]: would follow this certain protocol to
assess their cannabis use in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not schizophrenia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've described psychosis as a break from
reality and it can be triggered by taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be triggered by having an enormous
amount of stress or trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in instances of first episode
psychosis, there was an interview
[SPEAKER_01]: following where individuals were asked
about their history with cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study is designed so that people would
use whatever their local expressions were.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no looking at labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no describing quantitatively what
they had taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would say they smoked homegrown
or they smoked hash or whatever you refer
[SPEAKER_01]: to these things in French or Portuguese or
what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would use their colloquial terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that would be correlated with
what the national record was on what those
[SPEAKER_01]: substances are in terms of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this isn't even obvious in the main
body of the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're reading it, they're just
saying that individuals were, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of complicated statistics,
but they were saying that people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: users of potent cannabis, greater than 10%
THC, were more, I mean that people with
[SPEAKER_01]: psychosis were more likely to have used,
if they had used potent THC, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater risk factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was garbling that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas low potency THC under 10%,
the correlation wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm reading it and it's being
waved around, I'm like, well, how did it
[SPEAKER_01]: get to this 10%?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go to the supplemental
materials online and then still you just
[SPEAKER_01]: see these tables where it's determined
that hashish in Spain is greater than 10%,
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish in Brazil or in England is less
than 10%, homegrown, self-reported
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown in England is higher than 10%,
but in imported is less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they call it skunk, it's above 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these different things,
which that was buried in the references
[SPEAKER_01]: and where they got to that was buried in
the references of the supplementary
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like these government white
papers, like reports on health in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I had to dig and realize
that they're basically taking police
[SPEAKER_01]: records that say, hey, hash from Spain was
like this Moroccan stuff that was 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those kinds, that kind of chain of
custody, if you will, was used to define
[SPEAKER_01]: an arbitrary border where, where they
said, and you know, it's scientifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you shouldn't, you should make your
hypothesis in advance, but it certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: leads one to suspect that they chose a
border of high low where the statistics
[SPEAKER_01]: might work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 10% was just what they were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, it was arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, that gets claimed as being
scientifically based when anybody who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows about the process of testing
cannabis for potency in terms of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage knows that it's tricky and how
you prepare the sample and the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: machines you run it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of different variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, in substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first of all, the notion that,
you know, a sample of recorded,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that have confiscated imported
cannabis in England is necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: representative of what somebody was
smoking is, I think, quite a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really beherald it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there was an editorial that
accompanied it in the Lancet that was
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, well, this is an innovative
approach that's like combining like a
[SPEAKER_01]: material history to show that it's the
strong stuff that really reveals a time
[SPEAKER_01]: bomb for schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kills me is that that strength or
lack of strength and that correlation was
[SPEAKER_01]: used in the scientific article to justify
all kinds of hand waving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never read an article before that in
so many places says, if this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothesis of causality is true,
then they conducted a whole new set of
[SPEAKER_01]: thought experiments saying like,
hey, if this relationship we've put out
[SPEAKER_01]: here is true, then like X percent of all
of the psychosis in the Netherlands is due
[SPEAKER_01]: to high potency cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of all the schizophrenia in the city
of London is due to smoking high potency
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they said half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tremendous jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over and over again, it had,
I'm sure a reviewer made them repeat over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over again, if this causality is true,
because they had not established that
[SPEAKER_01]: causality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was no better in that regard than any
of these other papers that I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, made, you know, reference to in
this course of our conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The causality could just be every bit a
reverse causality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could entirely be a reverse causality,
where again, someone reporting with a
[SPEAKER_01]: first episode psychosis and they did
control, at least they attempted to
[SPEAKER_01]: control that it wasn't that they were
acutely, you know, stoned out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the cause of the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, you have to take on faith
that that was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was or not, but at any rate,
someone experienced a psychotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, reaction could have been that
that propensity could have been driving
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 10% threshold at any rate is is
arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on a flimsy record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes years and years old,
the measures that of how potent Brazilian
[SPEAKER_01]: hashish would be, the way I was digging
through the reference, it seemed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: from like 2004 to 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if it's more recent, what if it's
2015?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's to say how that cannabis was stored,
how it was ground up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as we know, and I reference in the
article, you know, it's been quite an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue in the U.S., labs that are dedicated
to the cannabinoid detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send same sample to different labs and
they can get different methods if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not following the same methods of
calibrating it and validating their
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sorry, but nationally,
national law enforcement from a scattering
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, half a dozen or more,
I mean, more than that, 10 different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries to think that they're using the
same methods and that you're comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: apples to apples is is kind of ridiculous,
even like comparing flour to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dense packed rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the preparation methods are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you tell me that that the that the
data sets that the studies were based on
[SPEAKER_00]: were using product categories like skunk
or homegrown, there's so much vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first of all, skunk really isn't a
category, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a misunderstanding of the of
the the community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then even even if we just had do have
a category of homegrown, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how it's grown indoor,
outdoor, the the genetics, the talent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower, all of these things add so
many variabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell me that the underlying data is
just garbage, and then the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: study is built on this garbage data and
then made to look good for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that is the part that really red
flags for me, like, like, why,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is it worthwhile to even put out the
rest of the study when it's based on on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, but it has been
sensationalized and it was right from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, even finding quotes in the
media from the authors and even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: study itself saying, you know,
that this was they went through this
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis of guesstimating how much what
proportion of, you know, psychosis in
[SPEAKER_01]: these different areas was due to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for the sake of influencing policy
out of a fear that potent cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products shouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that that jumped to another,
you know, important fallacy, which is this
[SPEAKER_01]: obsession over percent composition and
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're so scared about the
percent composition, I mean, dronabinol is
[SPEAKER_01]: a pill that's been FDA approved medicine
since the what early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if you're going to go down to
percents, well, inside that capsule,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's better than what 98% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pop in a bunch of those pills can lead
to a pretty profound, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to say that you put this arbitrary
limit on flour, it's just it's not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not it's certainly not rooted in this
claim that we got to follow the science
[SPEAKER_01]: and science has shown, you know,
over 10% THC to be a ticking time bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't shown the causality any better
than the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I would be remiss not to
say that this whole body of research,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is still it's still consistent
with the thinking that if someone does
[SPEAKER_01]: have a genetic latent predisposition to
schizophrenia, even if using cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they feel improves their
quality of life, it could be a risk factor
[SPEAKER_01]: for progressing their disease or speeding
the onset of frank schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be and this is my own thinking on
it that may be simply because if you get
[SPEAKER_01]: into a habit of cannabis, you're you're
more likely to eventually have one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those moments of taking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe that using it regularly high THC
cannabis desensitizes down regulates your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system, your receptors,
and that that at a moment of developmental
[SPEAKER_01]: vulnerability sort of takes away the
buffering capacity that the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is meant to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so these these are very I take
these issues seriously that someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: has a family history of mental illness,
especially psychotic illness,
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia, should be very cautious
around high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is really credible
and interesting research out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: having balance of CBD, you know,
whether it's a type two cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_01]: with balanced ratios or formulated
products, it may be that that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: less of a risk factor if there is truth
that someone with a disposition to
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia may hasten the onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: By using cannabis, it may be less so with
what are more modern, well controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal preparations and trying to
include CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is a nuanced conversation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important one and we value
people's lives and don't want to steer
[SPEAKER_01]: them wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blunt hatchet of a law that says,
you know, haha, you've thought you've
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized this, but we're instead going to
make it only legal to use less potent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the vast majority of the
population is never going to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: psychosis or schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are large swaths of people among
the medical cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who benefit from higher doses of
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those who are using cannabis in,
you know, adult use, responsible way,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, may enjoy, I mean, hell,
an irony here is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the legislation that's been
proposed only focuses on flower at all and
[SPEAKER_01]: not, you know, a vape pen that can have 80
percent plus THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's sort of the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to, if somebody is going
to ban flower on the base of 10 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, why wouldn't they go to concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like a setup for dabbing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, you know, if they're going to
use the mantra of this fall of the
[SPEAKER_01]: science, yeah, let's do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tide has changed on our perceptions of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the pendulum is swinging back in
a way that is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis has been discovered and
celebrated and forgotten and demonized
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over again throughout cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing we can say is that it has
spread around the globe more than it ever
[SPEAKER_01]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our understanding of cannabis and how
it works in our body is far more developed
[SPEAKER_01]: and sophisticated and scientific than it
ever has just by the evolution of science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we just we know better than
to rely on these fear based simplistic
[SPEAKER_01]: models.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just celebrate studies by,
you know, straight laced white coat
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians who are looking credibly at the
at the question and saying, you know what,
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of direct cause and effect that
smoking heavy cannabis is going to enhance
[SPEAKER_01]: the risk of schizophrenia is is not well
founded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reverse causality hypothesis is very
well grounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole body of literature needs to be
viewed through that lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it and it changes the story to one
that's more sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more it's less it's less
demanding of cannabis being this boogeyman
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a slippery slope to, you know,
wrecking our youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where all of that boils
down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't just dismiss whether it's,
you know, a new flash in the pan brain
[SPEAKER_01]: imaging study that says, hey, you smoke
weed, your brain looks a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or this kind of study that says,
look, we've we've studied large numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in many countries and we know that
people smoking potent cannabis are at risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, a life of madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at it from the mindset of
really critiquing the science to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what's there and what's been
oversold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate you, you know,
taking this measured approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: this topic with me, because, you know,
as we talked about before we recorded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to to gently detangle a topic
that's this complex, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not usual podcast fare for most
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to walk a lot of lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of the reasons that I like
you is that you're always willing to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: that line and and you give it to us
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I and I hope, you know,
my motivation for this show was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, most of us, you know,
you and I and the listeners of this show
[SPEAKER_00]: on unless they're joining us for the first
time, probably believed all of this to be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believed this very easily because
they knew the fix was in against cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all been smoking it and it's
been doing good things for our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a show like this, I think,
arms us better for conversations with our
[SPEAKER_00]: families and with our kids' school systems
and and with other stoners, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are are jumping on the bandwagon
misguidedly or are themselves repeating
[SPEAKER_00]: falsehoods about science in support of
cannabis, just like people quote
[SPEAKER_00]: falsehoods against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, man, I appreciate you and
thank you for joining us and sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I, you know, I look forward to
having you on the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am I do a lot more educating now on more
straightforward and bite sized subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these deep dives are sometimes are
sometimes really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't just be reflexive and say,
ah, everything these guys say is garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love what you said about being able
to speak with whomever school boards or
[SPEAKER_01]: activists going to legislature committees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's important to to address
science on its own merits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, dude.
