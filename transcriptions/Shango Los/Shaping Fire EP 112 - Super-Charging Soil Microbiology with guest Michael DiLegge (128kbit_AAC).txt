[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so cold over the entire country
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Bashon Island, where I live,
wind chill got well below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the southern states had wind
chill of like negative 40 and negative 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets this cold, my old house is
miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poor insulation here just lets the
cold right through and I have to bundle up
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep moving until the weather changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several parts of the country are without
power, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold and no electricity makes life
dangerous and unbearable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts of my island that have no power
have put their freezer foods outside in
[SPEAKER_00]: the icy cold to stay fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are grilling their defrosting
expensive meat and seafood so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy eating them before losing them in
case the weather warms before the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are even leaving town to stay
with relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, this is the theme
of today's Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like humans get miserable in crappy
weather, so does the microbe life in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough sunshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Frozen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine the microbes also putting all
their little foods out in the front yard
[SPEAKER_00]: and having the neighborhood over for a big
freezing barbecue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready for a lot of anthropomorphizing
of microbes today, because microbes are
[SPEAKER_00]: people, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, cultivation, and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and with good cheer,

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 112.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Michael Delegge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Delegge earned his master's from
Colorado State University's horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: department in 2020, where he researched
different facets of plant-microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, including nematode
biocontrol methods, microbial legacies
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting from replanting fields,
and even the caterpillar gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now serving as the director of
microbiology at Impello Biosciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: his research surrounds the overlap between
biological and biochemical agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs targeted towards both crop and soil
health properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis sativa is one of their model
organisms for agriculture research,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of Michael's projects is to
examine the functional bacterial species
[SPEAKER_00]: recruited by cannabis sativa in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will
discuss biostimulants and plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators and how to approach them as
regenerative cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second set, we will discuss the
care and tending of microlife in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third set, we will choose
companion plants for soil diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: finish the episode with an indictment of
the 24-hour light strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really glad that you made time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis farmers are always
looking for like a leg up, something
[SPEAKER_00]: winning to add to their recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of us look for different things
that could be determined to be
[SPEAKER_00]: biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a subsection of those people are
people mostly who follow this show who are
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneratively minded farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking for natural
biostimulants versus synthetic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start out the show by talking about
what biostimulants are generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll start to tease apart the
synthetic ones from natural ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my first question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are biostimulants and and what are
the kinds of kinds of attributes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: look for them to impart on our cannabis
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I like to think of
biostimulants as a really large umbrella
[SPEAKER_01]: term with several different kind of facets
of products or inputs that people can use
[SPEAKER_01]: or they can take advantage of that might
be in a natural system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess, in essence, you know,
they're they're very much performance
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancers for plant growth and metabolism
is how I kind of define biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say performance, are we talking
about specifically like the gathering of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition, the processing of nutrition,
improved photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, all of the plant's biological
systems get kind of like tweaked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor has turned up on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're running either more efficiently
or faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that's the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's a really good way to
put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, different parts of
biostimulants will upregulate different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plant metabolism or growth
rates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I think the primarily I look at
these as, you know, biological products,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like microorganisms and
biochemicals, things that are usually
[SPEAKER_01]: plant derived or discovered in nature and
then used to upregulate the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism, whether that's with hormones
or amino acids, fulvic acids, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this term upregulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it before, but I don't use it
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like it both for the biology
conversation, but it also sounds like a
[SPEAKER_00]: great euphemism for getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, oh, man, I need to go
upregulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's let's tease apart now the
synthetic and the and the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: biostimulants, because we're mostly going
to be talking about natural biostimulants
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I discuss bios, natural
biostimulants with other regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, we're usually talking about,
you know, this or that plant that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, you know, do a tea of or an
extract of or a, you know, a top dress of
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, because we want some
naturally occurring biochemical that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that to seep into our biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when at the conventions,
when I talk with the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: biostimulant sales guys, their products
have always got these like multi syllabic
[SPEAKER_00]: names that that sound very scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they've, you know,
they've also been named at some marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have got a real different vibe
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps or perhaps the natural ones and
the synthetic ones are both trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm guessing they have got different
attributes that that you can share with
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would think like a lot of times when
I when I think about synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: biostimulants, whether that's something
that is, you know, discovered through a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural process, and then you know,
one compound is isolated, it really seems
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot to me, like the pharmaceutical
industry, we find one active ingredient,
[SPEAKER_01]: we purify it, you know, it shows in a lab
and on the bench that this is effective at
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever we're trying to alleviate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of the you know, medicine is
built off of that compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how I look at like the
synthetic aspect of that where potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a there's a chance of missing some
other minor chemicals or you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites that might be from a natural
product extract that would be missed when
[SPEAKER_01]: things are just synthesized in a lab
versus extracted through a natural process
[SPEAKER_01]: like making a compost tea or breaking down
other forms of organic inputs like fish
[SPEAKER_01]: waste or even you know, corn waste,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing you describe it, it actually
reminds me a lot of how we talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect and the difference
between isolates and whole plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds a lot like the synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synthetic biostimulants are often like
isolates, they are an isolated biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to apply the plant one
way or another, versus the compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of flavor that's more like taking a
whole plant medicine, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all these these random plant
constituents that that we may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: even researched yet, but we know that as a
symphony, they they interact really well
[SPEAKER_00]: with the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really similar to how people
talk about the entourage effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and you know, turpenoids and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing goes for you know,
whether these these compounds whether a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic or natural biostimulant is
directly influencing the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a there's a good chance it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really helping out like the soil
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, things like you know,
the upregulation of the metabolism can be
[SPEAKER_01]: a factor of an increased rate of you know,
soil respiration or soil organic matter or
[SPEAKER_01]: just general beneficial soil ecological
components.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things like amino acids,
the things are one of the smaller terms
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath the larger biostimulant
umbrella can become building blocks for
[SPEAKER_01]: protein synthesis in both plants and
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by providing that source that might be,
you know, deficient in the soil or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, outcompeted by other microbes,
if a grower can add that in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's helping the plant directly
or the soil ecology, the whole system is
[SPEAKER_01]: benefited at least from what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do recognize that I've got
a certain amount of prejudice against
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic biostimulants simply because
they are synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that that is often unfair of me
just to discount things because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, outside of the fact that just on
its face, I prefer organic gardening and
[SPEAKER_00]: organic food and organic seeds because I
like to, you know, have my garden be as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to nature as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there really any, you know,
a priori reason to discount or not include
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic biostimulants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to compare it to is,
you know, we often talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bottled salt fertilizers on this
show about how they kind of force feed
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, you know, you might get
a robust plant, but you're also getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that is out of balance and over the
long term is more susceptible to plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and can have all sorts of other problems
because you're forcing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there any mechanisms like that
with synthetic biostimulants that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to reject them because of how they
function instead of just me being
[SPEAKER_00]: prejudiced because they are not organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand where you're coming from
with the synthetic prejudice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of adapt similar principles,
like in my own gardening and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I want to ask you a question about
what might be considered, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic to take a step back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with a process for an amino
acid product that is taking waste from the
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of shrimp shells and crab shells
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're put into a reactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple enzymes are added to break down
the fish waste or the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the crustacean waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the end product is both,
you know, amino acids and chitin and other
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, you know, synthetically,
the breakdown process is synthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: increased with these enzymes in the
reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to kind of slowly compost,
you know, shrimp and crab shells and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that in your soil,
you might have a similar endpoint product
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, beneficial effect of the
soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, how do you feel about that
kind of process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you call that more synthetic,
kind of toeing the line between the two of
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just is that purely synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, lab equipment and
bioreactors are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an interesting question to kind
of tease the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, from the top, I'll say the
word synthetic is a messy term,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's kind of like a, it's a bucket
of ideas that are different to pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who hears the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is best applied on a case-by-case
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on what you are, you know,
based on this little example, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like that is a non... It's
tricky, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's a natural process,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're just processing by
adding other natural processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you've got naturally occurring
product A and you're adding natural
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring products B and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you put them together and
it causes the breakdown to happen into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a usable nutrition faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we were to go long on this
and make it the brunt of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably have to ask a bunch of
questions about what are the natures of
[SPEAKER_00]: the inputs and where that line might be
drawn between, you know, adding inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that either inhibit natural reactions or
create non-natural reactions to get
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're trying to, you know,
produce, produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a slippery slope right there,
of course, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think, I mean, you know,
the processes would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretically occur in nature just a
little bit longer time for those enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: to unlock some of the polymers,
like things in, you know, the exoskeletons
[SPEAKER_01]: of crustaceans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we are synthetically or,
you know, in this type of process,
[SPEAKER_01]: development, somebody would be
synthetically upregulating or increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: the rate of decomp to make these things,
you know, in a more plant usable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way the plants and the soil microbes
have to expend less energy on breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: down things and they can just be,
you know, slurped up and used efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it kind of tells the line
between synthetic and natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that is kind of cool in
processes such as these, I know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: similar ones for corn and soy based
bio-stimulants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do put, use an end use product to
things that might be considered waste
[SPEAKER_01]: material prior to these types of
reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess we just want to make sure that
that waste material is handled in a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible way if we're going to produce
it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when it is not waste
material, when it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: host material for a crustacean farmer or a
corn or soy farmer, we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that those plants or animals are being
treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the management practices of
cultivating those are also not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: influence the inputs that we want to feed
our plants later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about some of
the natural bio-stimulants that come up
[SPEAKER_00]: the most often in cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking humic and fulvic acids,
seaweed extracts, different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial inoculants and then amino acids,
which you've already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these all, are these different types
of natural bio-stimulants working on
[SPEAKER_00]: different biological systems of the
cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they all essentially acting on the
same system, but in different ways?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they would definitely act on,
you know, the same system as a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, the soil, the microbes and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every, every part, everything you just
mentioned has a slightly different effect
[SPEAKER_01]: on the biome.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I understand, you know,
humics and fulvics can be great sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter for both the plant and the
soil microbes to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As inputs, whereas things like seaweed
extracts often contain plant hormones like
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokine and content and I think some
phosphorus or potassium as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a little bit of plant nutrition
from there, as well as some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant hormones applied outside of the
plant body rather than being produced
[SPEAKER_01]: within it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbial inoculants, I think these guys
really depends on your soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of that system or your indoor
cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those were primarily you know,
if they're administered in a drench,
[SPEAKER_01]: be benefiting the root systems of the
plants as well as the neighboring microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that might already be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have, you know, foliar spray
microbial inoculants too, that help out
[SPEAKER_01]: compete things that might be negative to
plant performances like molds and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it really is a whole system of
effects, you know, different building
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks from the bio-stimulant world will
help different areas of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a fun big umbrella term
because there's so much going on
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath the umbrella that is
bio-stimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sounds like it's a very fine line
between bio-stimulants and nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of the, you know,
some of the positive attributes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned from seaweed extracts are
different, you know, nutritive substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a scientific line between
nutrition and bio-stimulants or do they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like see into each other a lot of
times?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the line is maybe dotted as
opposed to, you know, less of a gradient,
[SPEAKER_01]: less of a firm line, where there were a
lot of bio-stimulant compounds can have
[SPEAKER_01]: some form of NPK or even micronutrients in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we look at plant nutrition,
those are products with NPK is almost the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest number on the label besides the
product name for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I see the separation
between, you know, nutritional inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: versus bio-stimulant based inputs,
but it is kind of a gray area or a
[SPEAKER_01]: gradient where you have some trickling
effects of the amino acid type
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-stimulants having some form of NP or K
in them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that definition, bio-stimulants
becomes really, really close to like trace
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, if you're not talking about
NPK and you're just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, you're talking about,
you know, bio-stimulants including things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't get in, you know,
kind of targeted generic fertilizers that
[SPEAKER_00]: we add because we want to round out the
rhizosphere with essential micros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing to mention too is,
you know, whether or not, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: another reason, I guess, that the line
between nutrition and bio-stimulation is
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little bit more blurry at this
point in science is because things like
[SPEAKER_01]: certain bacteria have enzymes to unlock
unavailable forms of phosphorus such as
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium phosphate, so unavailable for
plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's no nutrition in that
type of bacterial product, but it can help
[SPEAKER_01]: unlock nutrition that might already be in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like mycorrhizal products too,
I think from what I've seen also sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: have a phosphorus content as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, somebody might apply
mycorrhizal product for the first time and
[SPEAKER_01]: see a really great flowering boost in
their cannabis plants and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: attribute that to the mycorrhizae being
present or the increased amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus being also available for the
plant or probably both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wish that when we tried a whole
bunch of new things at the same time and
[SPEAKER_00]: we get good results, we could just
straight up ask the plant which one caused
[SPEAKER_00]: it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be amazing and yeah,
I want to talk to the soil microbiome as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to those developments
maybe with AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before we move on from biostimulants,
let's bring this conversation and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: like real rubber hits the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for the cultivators who are listening
who are like, okay, I understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the synthetic and the
biostimulants as much as we can get to
[SPEAKER_00]: definitionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of offering natural
biostimulants to my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some that you recommend from the
natural world that regenerative farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: can use at home that will have reliably
good effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff is so obscure and its
impact is so small that you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: debate about whether some of these did
anything at all in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are a couple tried and true
naturally occurring biostimulants that our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners can explore for pretty assured
benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think a lot of it really depends
on where your plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going into a hydroponic or
controlled environmental system,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the soil system plays a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am biased to the soil microbes and
the root adhering microbes or the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth promoting microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're here at shaping a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, from what I've seen in
both research and at home cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sooner microbes get introduced to a
plant root, I like to think about it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good protective and enhancing form.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite analogies here is think
of that radical that firstly emerged plant
[SPEAKER_01]: root from your seed or your clone being
like an empty seat at a table with,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say 100 seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is going to be exuding root
exudates all over that table and through
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are basically like adding
different types of food sources to the
[SPEAKER_01]: table here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sooner that those seats of the table
can be colonized with plant benefiting or
[SPEAKER_01]: soil ecology benefiting or even just free
living microorganisms, maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: colonized, but present and taking up
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And competing for resources, the more
likely the cultivator would be not seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: things like plant disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the seeds can be filled with things
like plant benefiting microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're from a compost system,
living soil, indigenous microorganism
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating, or even a biological
inoculant you can buy off on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is probably the best way to
really prime young or new plants for a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filling those seats up with the table,
allowing those resources to be used by
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are maybe symbiotic or
mutualist with the plants to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefit is, is a feedback loop,
whereas a pathogen might only,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, consume a root exudate until it
can get in high enough numbers to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate the plant cell and then become
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The less seats at that table that are for
things like Fusarium or if I top throw or
[SPEAKER_01]: Pythium, the less likely, you know,
that plant is going to have a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that seats at a table
example that I can really envision that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so your first answer is to,
you know, add a bunch of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous microbes, so that the seats of
the table can get filled with with
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic folks before anything pathogenic
shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and there's, you know,
there's a there's a there's a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that we talked about on the show to
add microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you're like, just, you know,
add them, add them right away as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as the plant starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the second one, is there something
that might be more nutrition based instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of like having good neighbors based like
microbes that you would also recommend as
[SPEAKER_00]: a naturally occurring bio stimulant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think my bias is really going
to show with this answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I talked about the probiotics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that prebiotics are just as
important, especially in soilless systems
[SPEAKER_01]: or near sterile systems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants evolve roots with their
relationships with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. White and all of his research
surrounding rhizophagy has really been a
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial disruption in agricultural
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of growers have
tried really hard to maintain a sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: system, which, you know, your plants don't
want sterile systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're often, you know, exuding cakes and
cookies, sugars and carbon into the
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to get microbes to colonize there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a long way to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like prebiotics, things like
organic materials, humic fulvic acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know what those can do to benefit the
plant and how they are benefiting the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome and how that's benefiting the
plant is still being kind of flushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that your plants are going
to benefit from these compounds that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're applying, whether or not they're
for the plant or the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually the application rates from
things, whether you're whipping up a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea or doing like a plant extract
or purchasing something, there's enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: go around for both the plants and the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that when we keep on coming back
to, you know, grab plants that are already
[SPEAKER_00]: in your yard and let them decay in water,
you know, spin that for 36 hours and then
[SPEAKER_00]: pour that back on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that cycle bringing back,
you know, what's already in your yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, the grass clippings,
the forest duff, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: incubate it for a little bit to make those
microbes super abundant and then just pour
[SPEAKER_00]: it back on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that, and it's always, you know,
a fun term is like kind of bioprospecting
[SPEAKER_01]: being out in soil, in the woods,
in the forest or anywhere that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's okay to kind of,
I'm going to use the word sample from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys have talked about
indigenous microorganisms here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, like the ability to kind of
collect some microbes microbial diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: from maybe a forest or somebody with a
better historical soil health practice
[SPEAKER_01]: than maybe the plot you inherited is also
a great way to, you know, add that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you know, we have these like
notions of plant micro symbiosis in
[SPEAKER_01]: science where, you know, we want to look
at a really happy cannabis plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: collect some soil microbes from its roots
and then take that home and apply it to
[SPEAKER_01]: our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do well too, but there's a lot of
functional redundancy in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome world, whether that's a palm
tree or a cannabis plant or some grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might even be able to get some type
of beneficial microbial function from
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling something like grass and applying
it to your home grow or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making a compost tea out of it or a soil
slurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dear listener, if you're very
interested in moving these microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: around, sit tight because we're going to
be coming back to this topic again with
[SPEAKER_00]: set two or in set two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michael, I want to move us on past
bio-stimulants now to what I consider one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their cousins that I know less about,
which is plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I first got turned on to
plant growth regulators, kind of as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a slur, as a diss, when I would come
across like really rock hard indoor rock
[SPEAKER_00]: wall buds that, that, you know,
I would squeeze them and as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as a, as a, lifelong outdoor
grower, when you squeeze my flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's some give to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these were like, like literally
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all like, what, what kind of
cannabis is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, you know,
because I tend to hang out with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, organicky farmers, they'd say
something like, ah, it's those PGRs that
[SPEAKER_00]: they use, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know what those are,
but, but I, I certainly don't want any
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and over time, I realized it's true
that synthetic PGRs and, and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a tendency to do to the plant are not
something that I'm normally going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started to realize while,
while studying the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are actually naturally
occurring biochemicals in plants that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that we can wild craft that also
are pro plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that maybe you can get, you know,
harder flowers that have got a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a market attraction and an aesthetic
attraction in ways that don't also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, injure the plant and make it,
you know, need to be grown in a sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: environment instead of the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so I'm going to ask you,
number one, would you, would you,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you explain for us what plant growth
regulators are and where we may find them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the natural world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I kind of understand plant
growth regulators would be just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the plant hormones, things like
oxygens, gibberellins, cytokinins,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, natural sources of those
things, like seaweed is a really common
[SPEAKER_01]: input used for cytokinin PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, like we talked about a little bit
earlier, you know, when you do the wild
[SPEAKER_01]: crafting and you do the natural process
and take your plant inputs or get
[SPEAKER_01]: materials and do the extraction yourself,
you are likely getting things that might
[SPEAKER_01]: be missed as opposed to one an oxygen is
purified in a lab and dried out into a
[SPEAKER_01]: powder and then, you know, mailed to you
in a tube to dip your plant roots in
[SPEAKER_01]: before rooting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the way I kind of see them would
just be plant hormones, whether they're
[SPEAKER_01]: natural or synthetic, I think they can be
helpful for growers and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful for making deadlines and yield
improvements and quality improvements and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I still kind of am in the school
of thought of, you know, these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these natural processes, like breaking
down or organic inputs would, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably missing something when we're
applying just the pure compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: but further, you know, science needs to
prove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if we're talking about,
you know, getting these oxygens and
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokines and gibberellins and,
and putting them on and then we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: them from plants, it sounds awful lot,
like we're talking about biostimulants
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and perhaps there is an
argument to be made that plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators and natural biostimulants are
all in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of plants that have got chemicals,
hormones, and nutrition that are also used
[SPEAKER_00]: by the cannabis plant that we just want a
wild craft or what's that term you used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bio prospect, you know, on our properties
and, and then just allow them to either
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade in their basic form or incubate
them with, you know, oxygen and then apply
[SPEAKER_00]: them to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's the same system,
just using different vocations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think like, you know, the PGR term
fits, fits nicely underneath the umbrella
[SPEAKER_01]: term that is biostimulants in my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe the world, but yeah,
you know, you think about how these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds mainly, you know, the plant is
naturally producing these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it needs roots, there's oxygens being
produced inside the plant to signal those
[SPEAKER_01]: meristem cells to turn into roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having, you know, furthered science in
agriculture, we as growers can,
[SPEAKER_01]: can use these things to get effects that
we want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in a lot of the ornamental crop
industry, things like anti-gibberellins
[SPEAKER_01]: are sprayed on, you know, flowers to keep
them like tight and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not too lay-y or stretched out from the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they make a nice compact bushy,
you know, poinsettia or zinnia or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's interesting to think about
the use of PGRs in products that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be consumed by people rather than just
enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it by like aesthetically,
like flowers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I need to do more reading on,
you know, the consumption of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be residual on flower if the plant
wasn't able to use all them and,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even just surfactants to get them to
spread as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I have talked with other
regenerative farmers about the naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring PGRs that they use, I only have
ever gotten one response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the farmers don't think of them in
that way and so they're just using
[SPEAKER_00]: degraded plant, you know, compost teas or
spun aerated teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll either say nothing,
they don't use one intentionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they will say banana peels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, is there any, oh, this is kind of
a nice pun, is there any low-hanging fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: that you recommend where we can go for the
hormones that have the effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant that we're looking for so
we don't have to go to synthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we want tighter flowers
and a more compact overall plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: do we want to go to a banana peel or are
there things that we may have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think might be, you know,
better for us to go after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think ultimately, I don't have any
sort of materials off the top of my head
[SPEAKER_01]: on things like anti-gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know seaweed is a good one for
cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have used, you know,
honeys for for auxins, whether that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's actually a root
increaser or if it's just a good
[SPEAKER_01]: antimicrobial for, you know, pathogens
that might infect the plant before it can
[SPEAKER_01]: root.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I'm a huge composter and
I'm a big fan of vermicompost as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, doing that stuff in
the backyard when space allows,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's indoor systems that are really
great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend that did like a three
bucket stack system where the worms were
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bottom, the new food waste went in
the top and when they ran out of food,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would kind of dig up and kind of make
it a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are ways to kind of get those
organic materials broken down depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the space you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, the other kind of school
of thought too is when I was a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: younger, I was always told, you know,
dig a hole six or seven feet underground,
[SPEAKER_01]: bury a couple dead fish there and that's
where we'll plant our cannabis plants the
[SPEAKER_01]: following spring in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been cool to kind of enter more
of the sciency realm of this kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing like, oh, well, yeah,
the fish breaks down into a ammonium or
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the form of NH4-3 and the
emulsions and, you know, they provide
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition from those breakdown products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just one thing that I love about the
cannabis science industry is, or just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a science in general, is kind of
seeing, you know, old school of thought
[SPEAKER_01]: growers with these really wise practices
that we are just now starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand and can be measured
scientifically with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how does a fish break down in the soil and
what types of plant inputs does it turn
[SPEAKER_01]: into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all of this old school cultivation
magic, you know, eventually science
[SPEAKER_00]: catches up with it and was like,
oh, yeah, I guess, you know, the old
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies were right in what they were
doing.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, yeah, everything old is
new again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's wrap up this first set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is microbiologist Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: DeLegge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_00]: buck than commercials on Shaping Fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneratively minded cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_00]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_00]: explore the Shaping Fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
postcard per person and the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_00]: audience is full of smart cannabis
enthusiasts, cultivators, and
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs who are always curious to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in the new year,
we are booking the few open spots we have
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for you to be one of our new
advertisers.

[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects mites
and nematodes, microbials, sticky cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: and air distribution units you need to
partner with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend Gaslamp Seeds to my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners who are looking for a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably already know Gaslamp Seeds as
Hembra Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hembra recently changed their name to
Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds is not just another seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp is a female-operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 60 breeders and over a thousand
strains to choose from, you will certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: find something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaslamp Seeds has something for everyone
with over 650 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 regular varieties, and over 200 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names you know you can trust like Compound
Genetics, Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl, In-House, FastBuds,
Gnome Automatics, and Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited Gaslamp to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_00]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have A-plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to you so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gaslamp Seeds cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want some extra freebies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the code shapingfire all one word at
checkout and they will give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional set of Gaslamp provided
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an extra $30 in free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy seeds from good folks who will send
you great seeds reliably every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit gaslampseeds.com today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Gaslamp Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is microbiologist,
Michael Delegge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked all
about biostimulants and where to find them
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature, as well as the idea of plant
growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept on coming back to this idea
that what we want to do to help our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants the most is to help the
rhizosphere, to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and variety of microbes are
incredibly varied, are indigenous so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they survive in our local natural
environment, and that we can bioprospect
[SPEAKER_00]: them all over our own property and near us
by just going to other plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: already have locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only does that save us money,
but we know that these plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already surviving locally are already
covered in indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saves us money and is exactly the tool
for the job to help you have your best
[SPEAKER_00]: grow ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in set two, we're going to talk
about the care and tending of the microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: community that's in your rhizosphere,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all of the residents of the
rhizosphere, the root zone, that make up
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil food web that is within the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, the soil food web also is
above the soil, and it also takes place in
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, we're talking about this
neighborhood of the roots of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was listening to Michael DeLegge
on our friend Leighton Morrison's show,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess I'm talking to the audience,
Michael, and to you kind of third person,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking on Leighton's show about
your love of biochar, which we're big fans
[SPEAKER_00]: of on the show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked how you kind of
anthropomorphized the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you were talking about how biochar
has got all these ridges and places to
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got these environments that
the microbes can set up housing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where their nutrition grows,
and how it just kind of makes for this
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like to think about my pots
that way too, or the soil that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a good neighborhood for my plants to
grow in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and I clearly enjoy
anthropomorphizing microbes, which I can
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and start just kind of
generally with this idea of creating
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods that have got the kinds of
attributes in the soil that these
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhoods can build on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the nature of soil structure that
makes good rhizomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good balance of sand,
silt, and clay, obviously, is a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, that definition of soil
makes a good structure for the microbes to
[SPEAKER_01]: colonize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a really important thing that
is often overlooked would be things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we call MACs, M-A-C, microbially forms of
accessible carbon, or microbial accessible
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are, you know, constantly
depositing these things into the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: through root exudates, as well as,
you know, any organic matter and different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of breakdown processes in soil or
other systems can provide these forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: MACs, carbon sources, food sources for the
microbes to be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, biochar being carbon based is a
really great form of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things like full urines and
different like, you know, cellulose
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown products are another great way
to kind of feed microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the primary, I'll say the first,
not the only, but is the primary attribute
[SPEAKER_00]: of creating a good neighborhood,
making sure that there's lots of these
[SPEAKER_00]: MACs around so there's always high quality
carbon for them to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like at the top of the list?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put that at the top of the list
just because if you apply something like a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological to a near sterile system,
I'll never call a hydroponic system
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile, just because there's microbes
everywhere, microbial ubiquity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have, you know, the notion of a
lot of that stuff can be wasted if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: not food sources to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you hear about with your gut and
gut health, prebiotics with probiotics,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, you know, feeding also the things
that might be resident to your system,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not they're applied from a
bottle or from indigenous microorganism
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are sources of these MACs that we
can wildcraft and how do we process them
[SPEAKER_00]: into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, the biochar,
you know, we can use as a soil amendment
[SPEAKER_00]: and some people like to crush it up and
top dress it into their water so it slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: works their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give us some more idea of how to think
about these MACs and where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: bioprospect them into our cultivation.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I'm going to do a call
back to biostimulants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of MACs in different tiers of
biostimulant products or things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get or procure naturally with
wildcrafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, you know, the plant is
also feeding your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as your plants are health
maintained, optimal health and nutrition,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is going to be some source of MACs
in the system from the root exudates too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will, you know, plants also can
reuptake root exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a degree of plant and microbe
competition for these food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to that kind of old wisdom
cultivation, you know, thinking people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I hear a lot of people have really
strong opinions about applying molasses as
[SPEAKER_01]: an input during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always kind of understood that as
we're feeding the soil microbes rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than we're, you know, giving sugar to help
increase flower synthesis or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've talked on this show many times
how, you know, the adding of molasses into
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot, what you're doing is throwing
your pot out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is if you're going to
use the molasses is feed the microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: your aerated Compros brewer, let them eat
the molasses there and incubate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have a whole bunch of them and
then put that compost tea that's not hot
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore into your your rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the are those the steps that
you're referring to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I think that that is probably
the best practice to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who, you know, are unable to
kind of have the lead time to brew a cup
[SPEAKER_01]: of compost tea and feed it sugar and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just a very diluted form and
irrigation solution can also kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit those those microbes that might be
in your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to push you a little bit on
specificity because you said that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, various plants that we can
wild craft, where we can get the max from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for examples, to get us started,
because we all know that we can like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Google it or ask GPT or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from you, will you give us three Mac
rich plants that we might be able to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: craft just so you know, people who just
want to jump on it know what where to
[SPEAKER_00]: start?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I'm always going to go
back to compost and those breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would when I say, you know, you asked
for specific plants, I don't know that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have any of those off the top of my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, carbon and nitrogen
sources essentially can help increase
[SPEAKER_01]: available max, whether whether or not they
are being added to your system or the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, you know, the compost pile or
something like that provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of kind of going out and
foraging up a bunch of plants and making a
[SPEAKER_01]: tea out of that, I would have to do some
more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your your hesitation kind of
like suddenly re contextualized everything
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it potentially the answer to the
question I asked that these Macs are in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything because carbon is a building
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so long as I'm starting with a a local,
healthy, thriving plant, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have max in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just use whatever I have a lot of
around me and use a variety of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I want to up it, we'll then go
ahead and do some online research and find
[SPEAKER_00]: out the types of plants that are more rich
in Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm starting to get the idea since we
keep on coming back to compost that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Max are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so just use whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another kind of way to put it,
you know, or another, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: using whatever you have should should be
used with caution a little bit as a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people know, you know, if you look for
broken down, dried out plant material,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to make sure that didn't come
from anything diseased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, you'd want that to be
fully broken down in a composting system
[SPEAKER_01]: or a heat breakdown type of format before
you add something that might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, degraded, you know, a leaf loss
due to a xanthomonas bacteria in the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to reintroduce that to our
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, plant health is very
important to when you're when you're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of wildcrafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when we're talking about the care
and tending of microbes, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to include a lot of these Max so
that there there is a a varied buffet all
[SPEAKER_00]: through the rhizosphere for for for all
the varieties of of residents to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you think we've covered that
well enough, let's go beyond the nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: for the microbes eating the carbon and
let's talk about some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes of soil structure that might
also be beneficial to to the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I might be over
anthropomorphizing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my notes, I put like shelter
reproduction space, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: non carbon nutrition, like like the idea
of shelter may not actually exist in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it seems like it should exist
there because you have got more more
[SPEAKER_00]: predator residents in the biosphere and
more passive residents in the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, normally life forms
need to take shelter when they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I I am very willing to
be very wrong on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but is it tell us a little bit about
how the community interacts and if there
[SPEAKER_00]: are attributes of our soil and amendments
that that potentially provide more of this
[SPEAKER_00]: shelter and reproduction space and non
carbon nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the best place for plants
to overwinter in terms of seasonal changes
[SPEAKER_01]: would be in the roots and in the in the
kind of skeletized plant bodies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer actively growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great place for microbes to
overwinter and be ready to be introduced
[SPEAKER_01]: to your plants when you're planting them
in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just do want to circle back a little
bit on the Mac stuff and say one more
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go back to I want to quote Dr.
Elaine Ingham from the soil food web and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know, what are microbes love
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the cakes and cookies that
are the root exodus are really kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, being deposited by the plants in
theory to colonize or recruit microbes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I wanted to mention
was going back to that that big open table
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy with empty seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another kind of enhancement of this theory
is is like if that table is being catered
[SPEAKER_01]: and and there is only, you know,
slabs of meat being put on that table,
[SPEAKER_01]: only only, you know, carnivore type people
are going to be sitting down there to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also want to provide a lot of
diverse inputs of Macs, whether that is
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of compost tea or sugar,
sugars like molasses or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just broken down leaves and pine straw and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the important thing is by providing a
lot of different forms of microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible carbon, we're feeding lots of
different functional microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if if there's if that table is being
catered with vegetables, meat and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of both, we're going to have
omnivores, vegetarians, vegans and
[SPEAKER_01]: carnivores all sitting at that table.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same applies in my in my head,
at least to the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the tomato root is only exuding the
same compounds tomato plants exude,
[SPEAKER_01]: then only a few types of microbes or
functional microbes are going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to use those food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grower can kind of apply different
forms of Macs, molasses, compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even companion planting to provide a
lot of different food sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the general thinking in microbiome
science, health is very closely associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with high diversity in a microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with my next question, I'm going to set
up a little a little example first about
[SPEAKER_00]: EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of folks like to use
EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is like, OK, you can buy EM1,
which is a blend of microbes, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: add it to your plants and your plants will
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to expand the bottle so
your your your bottle lasts longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's usually instructions on the back
of how you can do a a simple aerated tea
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can expand what's in your
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but eventually, if you just keep on
brewing it and brewing it, the the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that are differently aggressive
and competitive, the balance that is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual EM1 balance that they
recommend, it'll eventually get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to go and get a new bottle
of EM1 and start over with the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so using that as the example,
if we are grabbing lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are local to our area that are
thriving and we are either degrading them
[SPEAKER_00]: or extracting them into some sort of
extract or aerated compost tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there any awareness we should have
about the balance of those microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition that we're actually putting into
the pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: If if if we do want to have our
rhizosphere life to be in balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we influence that balance by what
we're adding from our compost pile as a
[SPEAKER_00]: tea, do we need to be worried about
throwing off the balance of the residents
[SPEAKER_00]: of the of the rhizosphere, because we are
feeding out of balanced teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, that is that is a major
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool that that a product like
that has those types of instructions for
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of increase, you know, bang for your
buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I think my best advice,
and this is maybe my opinion, but based on
[SPEAKER_01]: some science would be when you're making
those types of products, try to use them
[SPEAKER_01]: up, you know, do do your research and say,
you you've found a lot of sources to say
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 hours is the ideal incubation or
aeration time for a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to use that up pretty pretty quickly
after it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is based on the thinking
that all types of microbes, whether
[SPEAKER_01]: there's one thing in a bottle or a
thousand things from a sample of compost
[SPEAKER_01]: have different growth and metabolism
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when things are grown together,
the term is like co-cultured, the faster
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are always going to be able to
have that advantage towards the other
[SPEAKER_01]: members of that, you know, biome,
because they are just genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: advantaged to eat faster and divide faster
and break down faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see things like if you let a
compost tea sit for two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe if it's aerated, as opposed to one
week, I bet that that microbiome
[SPEAKER_01]: completely shifts just based on the
ability for those faster growers to become
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, the diversity was
probably the highest within the first 72
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of growing a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts to probably taper off just
based on the way microbial microbiology
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of works in that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so much food around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the fastest eaters are,
you know, kind of throwing their elbows at
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones and eating it faster,
they're going to become dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe those aren't the plant growth
promoting microbes that you're in search
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're just really good at eating
those max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea that that as you're as
you're brewing it for 36 to 48 hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're and you're pulling it out of the
bucket right then, you have got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated microbes and they've all just been
getting all the aeration and nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could possibly want,
which just means like everybody is fed and
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving and at the starting line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we want to give it to our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the longer we get away from that
starting line and let that compost tea sit
[SPEAKER_00]: for one day, two day, they're all they're
all already racing and competing and
[SPEAKER_00]: beating each other up and eating each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by day, you know, three or four,
you're fully at survival for the fittest
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not providing a nice even
balanced array of nutrition and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually providing them something
imbalanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have some sort of effect
on your on your soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound about right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and the way to say that is in
microbiome sciences, we use a term called
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a basket of fruit and there's
10 pieces of fruit in there and nine of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are apples and one of them is an
orange, I have really low alpha diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have 10 pieces of fruit in a
basket and one's an apple, one's a grape,
[SPEAKER_01]: one's a banana, blueberry, everything is a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parts of a whole are all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really high alpha diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the longer something like a compost tea
might sit, it's likely that you be
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering your alpha diversity where those
fast growers or good eaters are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: become dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I want to look this up after
the show, are you saying alpha A L P H A?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very interesting idea that is new
to me on compost teas as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collaborated on something when I was in
school where a colleague was making
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost tea from worm castings and
finished compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this person was able to grow it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they did a 48 hour aeration and
then they boiled half of it and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: applied the other half untreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually found that I think it
was a basil host or a tomato host.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants benefit more from the boiled
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not me suggesting that
everybody should be boiling their compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea, but maybe on their aeration time they
were able to increase the populations of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that might not directly benefit
plants and actually compete for plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: those beneficial parts that get released
when we make a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of interesting to think
about boiling or trying to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes out of a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that can't survive boiling
actually made the plants do better,
[SPEAKER_01]: presumably for a reduced amount of microbe
competition for the same things the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: wants that kind of get released from the
aeration process in compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boiling compost just kind of blew my mind
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to think a lot about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think about it immediately is
that if we've talked constantly throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode so far about the biodiversity
of the teas and of the carbons and of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sources that we continually pour
into our plants, that if I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated compost teas, and I'm also going
to do cold extracted teas, I don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why having a big pot of boiled
plants that I then let cool and then apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm going to get a whole different
cast of characters in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I'm doing is increasing my
diversity by using all three different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The non-boiled compost tea and the study
I'm referring to is kind of a balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: both probiotic or just bacterial members
and prebiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas likely after it was boiled,
it wasn't measured chemically,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was probably just more,
I'm going to use the term prebiotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just kind of the metabolites that are
released from the compost tea brewing
[SPEAKER_01]: process ready for the plant to slurp right
up rather than kind of have to share with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so before we move on to our
next topic, I want to hit something one
[SPEAKER_00]: more time because I've heard you kind of
allude to the fact that one of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: things that biochar does in the soil
structure is to not only provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon for food, but also it's like a
unique housing structure, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's got all these nooks and
crevices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything, and the answer may be
no, but I'm going to try to squeeze you on
[SPEAKER_00]: this anyway, is there anything else that
we should consider adding as an amendment
[SPEAKER_00]: to our soil that is less about nutrition
and having it break down to provide foods,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what most of the stuff we do is
for, but instead is something that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to amend the soil because it
actually provides a physical mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: that is good for the microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for that, I think the biochar is a
really good approach to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'll always recommend if
people aren't already doing this to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: starting soil test before you start
applying your inoculants or inputs to that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in terms of kind of like
housing the microbes or giving them like a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice place to live, again, I'm biased
towards the soil systems as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we think about no-till,
not only is that really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining soil carbon that's stored from
those plants, but that's also keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: those houses for the microbes dormant in
the plant roots ready to be introduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: the fresh roots that would be kind of
germinating in the same soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like me personally, I have one of my
experimental garden beds in my backyard
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've never tilled it for and I'll
plant seeds or directly transplant things
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be speculative that those
plants get a little bit of a boost because
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apply heavy compost and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of factors we're not
considering, but I think a big thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes have overwintering
structures and they were evolved with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to survive through these cold
temperatures and hot temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think people should maybe
experiment more with no-till or companion
[SPEAKER_01]: planting and things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that certainly makes sense regarding
our experience with no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, the soil just gets more mature
and it lasts better through the winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: the following year's plants are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always hardest that first year when
people are using immature bagged soil
[SPEAKER_00]: without a lot of mycelium and they get
kind of mediocre plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the longer they go no-till,
the more beefy the plants get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like a bettering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's probably a limit to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Year three, year four, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's system is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the more organic material and
different types of plant materials and
[SPEAKER_01]: their root exudates, stuff like that,
you can get in that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're adding that diversity, which is
really correlated with plant and microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotating and amending no-till soil every,
let's say, four years, that is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea of kind of old school
where every year you start with new,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh, clean soil that doesn't have any
pathogens in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, yeah, we want to avoid the
pathogens, but the best way to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: keep pathogens at bay is to have a
vigorous soil that's already aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always feel bad for people who are
very much set on the new season,
[SPEAKER_00]: new soil tip, because it just makes things
hard every year instead of year three and
[SPEAKER_00]: four being easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to me, that kind of feels like a
scorched earth type of approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that you mentioned the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what you just said, we've seen things
like fusarium species highly present,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to the sixth, 10 to the eighth cells
per gram of soil in a plant rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very far along into flower
maturation, and there's no signs or
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms of the fusarium attacking the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the fusarium is taking one
seat at the table with 100 seats,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other 99 seats are plant
benefiting things or soil benefiting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pathogens can be present without
becoming virulent, and it all comes back
[SPEAKER_01]: to soil microbial diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out competing fusarium is the only
potential solution that I see that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is other than just dumping the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about fusarium, I've had
fusarium specialists on the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and usually their answer is throw the soil
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting to realize that as a
preventative, since fusarium is
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, it's not like it's not going
to be in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you keep on adding
microbes, incubating microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding indigenous microbes, and fusarium
will never get a good foothold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, never is a strong word,
but I think- Fair enough, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Differently from adding all the microbes
and really intentionally applying diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of microbes, whether they're from
your wildcrafting or inputs somebody could
[SPEAKER_01]: buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing is soil health
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: This really is where a lot of this soil
microbial diversity preservation can
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those things like the prebiotics and
the organic inputs and companion planting,
[SPEAKER_01]: crop rotation, no-till, soil health,
I think, maybe even, I would put higher on
[SPEAKER_01]: the list than microbial accessible carbon
from the previous question, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: related, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last topic I want to hit during the
set two here is, so far this set,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been talking about the things that
we can do to make the living environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for the microbe life and in the
rhizosphere as diverse and beneficial as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and why that's everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep on coming back to the same answer
and it's because the answer is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we need to be doing as
regenerative farmers is adding diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil and let nature do the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also am very attracted to the idea that
the plant is also trying to help itself as
[SPEAKER_00]: well by putting out exudates that
encourage particular microbes or different
[SPEAKER_00]: residents in the rhizosphere where they're
kind of curating who they are attracting
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard you talk before about
recruitment, that cannabis plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: recruit bacteria that they find
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm unfamiliar with this idea,
but just the idea of it is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the right question to ask
you on it, so I'm just going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hand you the mic and say, will you tell us
about how cannabis plants recruit
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria itself, kind of like
intentionally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of literature from
the past five or six years that show
[SPEAKER_01]: photosensitive, photoperiod-sensitive
plants or plants that have major changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in development also change their root
exudate profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was first learned about in a
ribidopsis, wild mustard model,
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that has a rosette stage and then
it bolts and then it makes flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: those flowers make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At each one of those stages, it was seen
that the root exudate profiles change.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early growth and development,
there was just a ton of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later in the flowering and maturation,
there was a lot of organic acids and
[SPEAKER_01]: things that can be harsh to certain
microbes, whereas sugar is like a really
[SPEAKER_01]: broad food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the kind of thinking from the authors
of that paper were, and I'll get to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis too, I promise, were about the
developmental needs of the plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: changing, more nitrogen in the beginning,
more phosphorus and potassium later,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those micronutrients trickled
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that the microbes help plants
uptake these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's wonder if the plant is actually,
I'm going to use the term intentionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling for different things as it goes
on through growth and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, being a cannabis enthusiast,
seeing that study, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, what's the most popular
photoperiod-sensitive plant that we use,
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, I'm not sure if root exudate
work has been done, but we've done some
[SPEAKER_01]: work on the vegetative versus the
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a couple of weeks after flower
onset, after the solstice, and the days
[SPEAKER_01]: get short in an outdoor system,
as well as the harvest, functional
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that regardless of the specific
species of cannabis or strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's hemp or cannabis,
0.3% THC producers or higher, the same
[SPEAKER_01]: functions or at least the same bacterial
genera are occurring in many different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of soil environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the USDA climatic zones for
that, but basically cannabis being as
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionally needy as some other plants,
we see really strong associations with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria based on development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we use the term recruit,
it's kind of like the cannabis plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: sending these signals into the rhizosphere
to likely get some type of rhizospheric
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the bacterial or fungal or just anybody
in the soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these needs are pretty standard from
the cannabis sativa plants, whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: are classified as hemp or marijuana,
depending on the amount of metabolite it
[SPEAKER_01]: produces, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that to say is plants really want
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can kind of provide microbes
that the plant can't search for in indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: systems or in really, you know,
low alpha diversity, 10 year monocultured
[SPEAKER_01]: cornfield soils where there's lots,
there's like five different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can kind of benefit the plant in a
way that it would in its natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in the wild type relatives and
the progenitors might have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of evolved to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like if I'm understanding it
correctly, the main point is that over the
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle of the plant, the plant the
dominant bacteria is in the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know the mechanism or at least
we're pretty sure that the mechanism of
[SPEAKER_00]: why it changes is because the plant wants
different types of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's putting the plant is putting
out different types of exudates to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage different types of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best thing that we can do is
to, you know, A, let the plant do its job
[SPEAKER_00]: and then B, do our part by offering
varieties of other nutrition and probiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and such that the plant can't
produce and it needs to get its
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that between the partnership between us
and the plant, the roots have just got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it could possibly desire to
express itself most fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a perfect distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, most importantly,
the I'm going to sound like a broken
[SPEAKER_01]: record, but soil health, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the soil health is maintained,
then we are going to assume and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've proven like the science
has proven, there's lots of alpha
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity, microbial diversity in a very
healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether or not the microbe that's
present during the vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_01]: period of your cannabis plants life cycle
is recruited by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time, if you maintain that
soil health, it's likely there will still
[SPEAKER_01]: be those microbes in low enough cell
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the plant changes its root
exudation compounds, presumably to attract
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, to help it meet its nutritional
needs based on development, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, soil health maintains microbial
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bugs are hanging around when your
plant is flowering and in need of those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that summary a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's very rare in discussing
soil health and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil maximalism, if you will, to actually
have that clear of a recipe for what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for that, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take our second
commercial and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is microbiologist,
Michael Delegge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, you know, without these
advertisers, shape and fire wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
that you heard of them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on Shaping Fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the revolution seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they will start to flower at 16
and a half hours of daylight instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: the typical 14 and a half hours of
daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one THC to THCV, and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds are very consistent, true grown
inbred F1s from stabilized inbred parent
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack,
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still
family-owned, patient and
[SPEAKER_00]: employee-centric, and partially powered by
their two acres of solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an
all-natural fish poop concentrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_00]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: further enhance nutrient availability for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_00]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_00]: charities.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.

[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is microbiologist, Michael Delegge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at the big finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we talked all about
bio-stimulants and plant growth regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we wanted to do as regenerative
cultivators to make sure that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthiest, most biodiverse soil so the
plant can do its job of growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy way that resists pests and gives
us awesome yields and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we talked a bit
more about the care and tending of microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: life specifically and not only how we can
add microbes and biodiversity like we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking in the first set, but also how we
can help them thrive and keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: well-fed with carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on the third set, we're just
gonna hit on two more kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: miscellaneous biodiversity types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topics that didn't fit in the other two
sections, but I think are really important
[SPEAKER_00]: and things that we have talked about prior
on the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first of the two is choosing
companion plants to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michael, we've talked quite a bit today
about plant exudates and how plants push
[SPEAKER_00]: out the exudates from the root structure
and attract different microbial life and
[SPEAKER_00]: life forms in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it wants to use as different flavors
of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that the plants that are
planted near our cannabis plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the rhizosphere of our cannabis
plant because it is also calling forth
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of nutrition and mycelium
to its root systems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand partly what you study is
how these systems may interact and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose companion plants that will be a
good neighbor for whatever the target
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that we're looking to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, we're talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so will you kind of talk us through
how to think about choosing our companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in order to encourage the most
biodiversity in our soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the reason that this isn't
more widespread or adapted or adopted
[SPEAKER_01]: rather is because of the scalability of
this, but I would love to see it on
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think two really cool examples that are
new to me for kind of companion planting
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis would be, I had some friends
do the three sisters, but replace the corn
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cannabis plant as opposed to
corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who don't know, the three
sisters is corn, beans and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn serves as a trellis for the beans
to grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beans have a nitrogen fixing symbiotic
bacterium called rhizobium that live in
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots and that nitrogen can get
leached out of their roots and be
[SPEAKER_01]: available for both the corn and the
squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the squash with their large
leaves at the base of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they provide shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil stays kind of cooler temperatures
and doesn't get baked from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, they replaced the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn with the hemp plants and the
cannabis plants to serve as that trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: for the beans to climb up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both the squash and the, excuse me,
the hemp was able to benefit from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beans being present due to that rhizobium
bacterium being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also certain soil temperatures,
if they get too hot, that can actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental to microbial populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that cooling effect from the
squash leaves, depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, Colorado, we have 320 days of
direct sunshine that can help cool it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep those soil temperatures happy for
lots of different things to keep growing
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than just the ones that are
tolerant to warm soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you move past the three sisters,
I have got to ask, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have beans climbing up our
cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that sounds awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I imagine that the bean plants get
all into the flowers and then and how does
[SPEAKER_00]: that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might require a little bit more
maintenance from the cultivator than most
[SPEAKER_01]: people can do in a production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so they would kind of climb up
and own the fan leaves and things along
[SPEAKER_01]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the bush beans stay closer to the
stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because normally the flowers are kind of
far away from the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the beans perhaps going to just
grow up the center of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not grow out to the flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will the with the beans eventually grow
out the branch to the flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones I the ones I saw in the system
were more so like the the tips of the bean
[SPEAKER_01]: vines are, you know, yeah, we're kind of
hanging out in the empty space between fan
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves in the middle parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't quite make it up to that top
cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this is one one example,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So another approach to this, though,
because I do hear what you're saying with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, beans could effectively act like
a bindweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pull plants down like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a bush bean or a different type
of legume like a cowpea might be a better
[SPEAKER_01]: type of nitrogen fixer to get that,
you know, diverse root exudate profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse microbiome from the root exudates
and the nitrogen component to from the
[SPEAKER_01]: legume plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those different types, those bush
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why those are better is
because you would plant those at the foot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their rhizospheres could talk to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant is not a climbing bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll just have like bean
shrubbery at the bottom of your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't climb the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where where that goes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like that rhizosphere becomes
representative of at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three different types of plant
species with your what your vining squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your fruits should be okay,
because they'll be far away from the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of the beans that are kind of bushing at
the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have all those roots kind of in
the same root ball, as long as there's
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate nutrition and organic material,
that will be like a very healthy diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome as a factor of just having
three different hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked on the show before to
that people who who grow in berms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy built up with compost and you know,
grass clippings and other agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: clippings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very popular to grow potatoes in that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, you've got your potatoes and
your beans and your squash kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trailing off down the down the line of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved the idea of growing food
crops with the cannabis so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed yourself and as well as, you know,
smoke and save your soul, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now that I've pushed you on that,
what other what other strategies or plans
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have in mind for creating a diverse
rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was something that was kind of
new to me that I read about it didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: to see this one in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a farm that had been co
planting a plant with a mushroom so they
[SPEAKER_01]: were kind of using myceliated beds of a
wine cap mushroom to get both harvest of
[SPEAKER_01]: wine cap fungi edible mushrooms at the
base of the soil and the the hemp was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow and flower at the top so it was
kind of getting both you know that fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome benefit as well as the the
plant roots there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not directly, you know, plant to plant
signaling like we're seeing with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: three sisters we just discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something along the lines of you know,
trying to have more bang for your buck in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of square footage for harvesting and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wine cap mushroom is one of my
favorite eating mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're absolutely delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do that in my indoor and it
didn't work out because the the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: for mushrooms seems to be a little higher
than we want it to be in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as you've got good plant coverage
because normally we want our plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: direct sunlight, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mushrooms don't want to be in the
direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to make sure that you're
growing plants that are going to be big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to create that shadow underneath
that allows the the wine caps to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maintain that humid microclimate
underneath the plant canopy that is super
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and the squash will help with that too
that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any more on that before before
I move on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just companion planting is really,
really excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is a, you know,
go back to the literature and look out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you have deer eating your
your hemp marigolds can be deterrents for
[SPEAKER_01]: deer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a different, different
plant for a different need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just always going back to the more
diverse roots and host in the in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: would increase your soil health and
microbial diversity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I actually was planning on doing big
pots of marigolds next to the plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time this year, because we do
have a lot of deer pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, I got some, some deer fencing
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that'll help too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it is it as effective that if the
the marigolds are are not in the pot with
[SPEAKER_00]: the candles or in the ground next to it,
but like are beside it, that the smell of
[SPEAKER_00]: the marigolds is enough to keep the deer
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will the deer just come over and browse
the weed and just ignore the marigold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest with you, when I when I
tried to use marigolds as a deterrent crop
[SPEAKER_01]: in Maryland, I watched a deer chew one
down before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, that's kind of like,
I think they vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, like, kind of like
different, different strains of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: might have different turpenoid or
cannabinoid profiles, different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: marigolds, you know, they have the
multicolored ones have different type of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochemical profiles, or, you know,
those volatile organic compounds that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell icky to deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know a variety off the top of
my head, but I imagine that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very species specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your, your honesty in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if we're really going to go
for it, you know, these bio regions have
[SPEAKER_00]: got different deer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So different deer could be accustomed to
browsing different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, whereas Maryland deer don't like
marigolds, but or no, they do like
[SPEAKER_00]: marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and maybe, you know, my West Coast
deer are more snooty and they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: marigolds, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we leave the companion planning
topic, I just wanted to ask, are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are obviously a poor
neighbors?
[SPEAKER_00]: The name for it is escaping me at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but there's there are often plants
that you don't want to plant near other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because they they will they might
poison each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or or or or be toxic to the other person's
or the other plants rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aware of any of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is one that's jumping off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I know there's, you know,
a lot of examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black walnut trees, for example,
you know, not specifically related or
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated for a regular harvest,
like we're talking about with cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those those guys have a root exudate
that is under the nature of allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are actually able to shoot a
compound into the soil that makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty inhospitable for anything but its
spring to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to counter that, there's also plants,
I think certain trees as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, don't want its own
offspring to to compete with the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom plant for the resources there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll they'll send signals into the
soil that make it inhospitable for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants of the same species to grow to try
to, you know, preserve its own nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's that's good to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to throw in my two,
even though some people like these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always make sure that any any
plants that I consider for a companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plant does not give off floating seeds
like dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally really love pink dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I and I encourage them in my
yard, actually, because they look really
[SPEAKER_00]: trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but but before they go to seed,
you know, I've got a different seed crop
[SPEAKER_00]: at a different property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but like, I have to make sure you
know, I grabbed those because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: all those like little fuzzy puffballs in
my resinous flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely a party foul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any plant that gives off,
you know, the fluffy seeds that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be wind distributed, you want to be
careful of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even though a lot of people like
red clover, I personally caution people
[SPEAKER_00]: from the red clover, because the red
flower shoots up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't grow monster plants,
if you're growing plants, plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: only, you know, three feet and not 10
feet, three feet, the clover could totally
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up into and start interacting with
your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last question here is is one that I
talk about sometimes on on shaping fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but but mostly the discussion has has
happened on the shaping fire YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, where I posted a video with a
micro biologist that was a specialist in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant microbe interaction, talking about
how the 24 hour light strategy is is bad
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I fully believe this to be the
case, because, you know, photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have a have evolved processes that
happen during the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so if the plant is naturally growing
outdoors, it gets a day cycle gets a night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle during the night cycle, the
photosynthesizing stops and other
[SPEAKER_00]: processes happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you keep a strong,
rambunctious plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know from experiments indoor plants
when you're supplementing with light,
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you grow the plant at 24 hours,
it's it's like giving the plant cocaine or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like where the plants just go go
go go a constantly photosynthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly process these sugars go raw and
like and so it will it will make your your
[SPEAKER_00]: your your seed germinate faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make the young plant move faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring it into becoming,
you know, a ready to flower teenage plant
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the flowering, some people
find that they reach maturity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower faster to such a degree that they
can, you know, knock a week off of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, listen, if if if if
I do that with every cycle my whole year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually squeeze in another cycle a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's real money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, the case for a 24
hour light cycle is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take every opportunity I can to try
to teach that the dark cycle is necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, Michael, you know, you're you're
the front line of this debate as a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiologist, you know, these cycles
intimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you know what happens in the you
know what happens in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I'm going to kind of throw
myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, hopefully I'm not wrong in your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to hear you speak to this
idea of the 24 hour light strategy and and
[SPEAKER_00]: how that that might impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, that's got to be one of
the most nutritionally expensive types of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation practices, I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what types of, you know,
nutrient usage rates people are going
[SPEAKER_01]: through if they're doing this practice
with 24 hour light cycles, because I would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine that with 24 hours of daylight
without any types of resting period,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant is going to be constantly
requiring extremely high concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essential processes like the Krebs cycle
happen at night time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants also do these things called like
gaitation, where there might be air
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbles in the plant vascular tissue,
which can be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at nighttime, they can push those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they also close their stomata
and don't evaporate the water out of their
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think primarily the the benefit to
get another cycle might be missed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of nutrients somebody might need
from trying to maintain the nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: needs of the cannabis plant by blasting
them with 24 hours of light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be, you know,
basically giving your plants cocaine and
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping them at high energy, high growth,
optimal fast growth rates and
[SPEAKER_01]: developments, there's going to be a lot of
energy spent for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to them for them to kind of
account for that deficit, there needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be tons and tons of available nutrient
inputs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that one other cycle
might be beneficial enough to have to add
[SPEAKER_01]: that much more fertigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, the people who are
defending the 24 hour light cycle are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually people that are using,
you know, two part bottled salt
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're kind of like force feeding
the plants nutrition anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's it's pretty rare to
find a, you know, a bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: grower who isn't overfeeding anyway,
because if some is good, more is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so that that's actually the
answer that I get online when discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: this with these these cultivators are at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if it just makes the plant more
hungry for more nutrition, I'll just pour
[SPEAKER_00]: more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, ah, it's not really how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for folks who aren't familiar with it,
you mentioned that the Krebs cycle happens
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you will you explain what that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the the plant starts to respire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it stops using the light or the photons
from the sunlight or your LEDs or any
[SPEAKER_01]: types of lighting you have as kind of like
the building blocks to metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts to respire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's getting its energy from
off gassing things that might be in there
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to using the light energy to
kind of make more chloroplast and things
[SPEAKER_01]: along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm when I'm talking about this
with folks who are very, very into the 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hour light strategy, they come back to me
and they're like, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you're telling me I can't do this,
but I do this all the time and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I smoke them and I get high and
it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and to the best of my scientific
knowledge, I say to them, I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, but you're you're getting a plant
that isn't the best plant you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you need fast, cheap,
styrofoam tasting flour quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that that might be an appropriate
strategy to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since most of us are looking for a
thriving plant, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: also provides high quality terpenes that
just like engage us and give us a better
[SPEAKER_00]: high and also creates pest resistance,
it seems to me that the 24 hour light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle will slowly but surely degrade a
cannabis plant throughout its entire life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are your thoughts about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is the is the is the life of the
cannabis plant so short where over where
[SPEAKER_00]: over that life cycle, it doesn't matter if
we starve the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of am thinking that it does matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the cannabis plant life cycle is
a lot longer to to maturation and harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: than a lot of other different crops that
are kind of following the school of
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, speculatively,
there's a lot of things that happen that
[SPEAKER_01]: are beneficial to the plant vascular
system during the rest period,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing those air bubbles out,
closing those stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things along those lines that I would
imagine play a role in the synthesis of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenoids and other
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, it would be interesting
to do a side by side with the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar or strain of of cannabis,
you know, in a 24 hour cycle versus an
[SPEAKER_01]: 18-6 followed by a 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that I wanted to
mention, you're talking about kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor growers and having those two to one
salts readily available and probably
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly over applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be cool to get to a point to
where we can kind of start to supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: those conventional salt based fertilizers
with more organic things and maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from Dr. James White,
the rhizophagy scientist using those salts
[SPEAKER_01]: that are easily slurped up and immediately
used in building blocks of the plant body
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of as like corrective treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice a deficiency, you apply a salt
and then you start to kind of balance both
[SPEAKER_01]: your your salt and your organic base of
nutrition inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only will that benefit the plant,
but also same thing with the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been studies showing the same
exact, you know, strain of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in living soil versus growing in
hydroponics with biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the terpene and cannabinoid profiles
are statistically different from one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of that has to do with
the terroir or the terroir of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of supplementing with with salt
on its face, I'm prejudice against,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a citizen scientist, I want to
learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, well, well, thank you for for
diving into that topic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly something that I am
passionate about and I get argued with
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anytime I, you know, when I get a
microbiologist like you willing to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: me about it, I always bang that drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess more on the microbe side,
I think just like the soil temperatures do
[SPEAKER_01]: cool or the roots temperature,
the root zone rises for your temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: will also cool in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of factoring in the microbiome,
that's just allowing more environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to maintain different diversity
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the darkness period, because you
know, a grow room will cool off 10 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: when the lights are off and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's different cycles that
need a cooler temperature to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I'm interested in kind of
learning more about the effects in the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiome, you know, with this 24 hour
versus getting that rest period that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know, were evolved to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Michael, we are here at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing your
expertise and experience and and time and
[SPEAKER_00]: good cheer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really enjoyed our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I didn't expect so much so
many times for us to come back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer being diverse microbe teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but really, you know, the more I get
into regenerative growing and really
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a way that's response to
nature, the more I realize that the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers only job is to create rich,
nutritious, nutritive, biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so you're always going to come
back to tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thank you very much for being here
and for for, you know, sharing what you
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great conversation and I'm really
grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to kind of just, you know,
talk about this stuff with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's nice to find another narrative
for this stuff.
