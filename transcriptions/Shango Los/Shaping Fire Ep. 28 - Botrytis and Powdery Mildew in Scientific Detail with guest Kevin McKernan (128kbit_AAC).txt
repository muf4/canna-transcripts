[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things in cannabis as
frustrating as mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your hard work can come crashing
down by the sudden visual signs of powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew or botrytis molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough to make you cry, chastise the
source of your clones, and try to strike a
[SPEAKER_00]: bargain with God.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much misinformation out there
about both powdery mildew and botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been handed down from generation to
generation of cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now though, cannabis is attracting
scientists and laboratories that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: sort out the biology of these moldy
menaces to society.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoy hearing frank discussions
that dive deep into cannabis health,
[SPEAKER_00]: business, and technique, I encourage you

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Kevin McKiernan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin McKiernan is founder and chief
science officer of Medicinal Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Genomics made worldwide news in
2011 when it publicly released the first
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequence for cannabis satelites.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of this work, Medicinal
Genomics launched a suite of tools for the
[SPEAKER_00]: detection of microbial contamination of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to Medicinal Genomics, Kevin was the
team leader of R&D for the Human Genome
[SPEAKER_00]: Project at the Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research at MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of vocabulary I want to point
out for this week's episode, we use the
[SPEAKER_00]: term labs a lot this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're referring to cannabis
analytical laboratories, but most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time we're using the word labs as
shorthand for a collection of living
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally referring only to lactic acid
bacteria in organic growing, it's often
[SPEAKER_00]: used nowadays to refer to a wide range of
probiotic cultured microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite an exceptional podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Kevin, you know, this time of year,
molds and mildews are being talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: by growers everywhere, because as the
nights are getting colder and damp fog and
[SPEAKER_00]: rain start to become more common in the
weather report, mold becomes more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll talk about butritus a
bit later in the show, but easily the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common scourge that everyone has to deal
with is powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biologically, what is powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this evaded us for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: For quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best resources to go to are a
book from John McPartlin and Dave Watson
[SPEAKER_01]: and Robert Clark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a great list of all these hemp
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We marched through there trying to build
DNA assays that could detect powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, why would anyone want to
try and pick up this organism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from what we've learned about what
powdery mildew does in hops, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: closest relative to cannabis, is it has an
infection cycle where when it first lands
[SPEAKER_01]: on the plant, it actually builds what's
known as a hostoria or like a taproot into
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant where the spore lands,
and then it builds a mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this mycelium network is sometimes,
it's debatable whether it's in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or outside of the plant, but it spreads
that network across the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes in hops sometimes 18 to maybe
40 days before it gets a stress event that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it make spores, which is the powder
that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those spores are very hardy and they
spread the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got brought in to try and figure out
what this thing was by trying to build
[SPEAKER_01]: assays for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we built some of these DNA assays
going after the organisms that John was
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing us to, which was El Torca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have an organism in there called
S.
[SPEAKER_01]: macularis, but it's recently been renamed
to P. macularis, which stands for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, Potosfera macularis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are these things is your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are obligate biotrophs, which means
that you can't culture them unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: have leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried putting them in cultures and that
didn't behave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to grind up leaves or somehow and
make it so that there's actually some leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: cells in there for these things to
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But an obligate biotroph also means that
they're generally very much adapted to
[SPEAKER_01]: their host.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tend not to see powdery mildews
hopping species to species very much like
[SPEAKER_01]: you might see with Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll find powdery mildews that
are very specialized, like the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in grapes are known as Golavinomyces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a vino in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are on hops is P. macularis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some debate as to whether that
was crossing over to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not yet found evidence for that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we dug into this, we built all of
these assays hoping we'd find something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was on grapes, like Golavinomyces or
these El Torcas, another one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went down a bit of a rabbit hole
trying to sequence the genome of this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have found to date is we
actually believe it's a novel species
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is something that has about 98%
identical to P. macularis, which is on
[SPEAKER_01]: hops, and about 98% identical as well to
Golavinomyces and Brogia, which is another
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very interesting organisms,
but they can, as everyone knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can totally destroy your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you can detect them in advance of
the sporulation stage where they make
[SPEAKER_01]: these things known as canidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're aiming to do with
this genetic test.
[SPEAKER_01]: This genetic test is to enable people to
screen clones or to screen their plants at
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain period of time and remove
anything that has a positive hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this will help people breed
faster for resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're screening for plants that have a
lot of this on them, well, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably susceptible to it unless you're
picking up a single spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been trying to do some work
where this test is fairly sensitive enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick up these mycelium networks,
but doesn't get triggered by the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not as hard to do as you might
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores can last a winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really hardy, and they're very
hard to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story is there are different
species pretty much in every organism you
[SPEAKER_01]: run into, and we don't see much evidence
of this hopping species to species,
[SPEAKER_01]: or host to host, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time I've heard the
anchor on the spore described.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the ways that
people get confused about whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: PM is systemic to the plant or merely
opportunist, because I can imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: the spore lands and it creates that
anchor, which is probably breaking the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the derma of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly now it's also inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that anchor idea, what is it
biologically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it systemic or is it opportunist and
topical?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The definition of systemic is usually
reserved for something that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: circulating through the xylem and phloem
or in the bloodstream of HIV in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say it might be hard to claim that
it's systemic, although I should say the
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments we have done have not
necessarily nailed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have seen is that it can be
present in the plant in a mycelium network
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can't visibly see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the debate right now is whether that
mycelium network is internal to the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: or external to the leaf, but for practical
purposes it may not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be a bit of an academic question.
[SPEAKER_01]: For screening purposes, there's not much
use in a genetic test that picks up
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew after you can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too late then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to get something that
picks it up early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the key to thwarting most
infectious disease cycles is to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have early detection so that you can
remove the plants that carry the infection
[SPEAKER_01]: from spreading it any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a quarantine and contain approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately breeding for resistance I think
is the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this may be a tool that helps
accelerate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can find the plants that
chronically have high levels of powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew DNA on them, well then those are
most likely to be susceptible strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: you should pull them out of the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a really good paper I'll point
people to that maybe we can put into the
[SPEAKER_01]: show notes from a gentleman by the name of
Wieblen who did a lot of work trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: address this systemic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that paper they do mention
systemic, but I think it might be a misuse
[SPEAKER_01]: of the term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they demonstrate is that they
stain the DNA of this organism with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can see the network of this
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of beautiful to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that from a single spore
that hits the leaf, it really goes
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters away, really outside of the
entire focal view of the image that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these networks spread very,
very quickly around the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the unknown questions we have
today are, well how early can you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: pick this up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how quickly does that mycelium network
spread?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you gonna get it 18 days before it
outbreaks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you gonna get it 40 days?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are unknowns in cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen the work in hops and we're kind
of drawing parallels from hops,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of the work in hops shows that
P. macularis will have maybe 20 to 40 DPI,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is days post infection when you tend
to see the actual spores kick off from
[SPEAKER_01]: when they found the initial infection of a
spore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big gap and stress tends to
accelerate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you happen to get infected just
before flowering or before flush,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna bring out some of the
sporelation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help but chuckle when you tell me
that the science is not fully decided on
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's systemic or merely
topically opportunistic because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much arguing and gnashing of teeth online
between growers who know for sure one side
[SPEAKER_00]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's getting upset about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're saying, well actually the
science is still out and we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it doing to the plant itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know that when the plant is
more stressed, it's more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the spore feels has a stress
event, it spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it actually doing to the plant
itself that is damaging the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the stress signals that go
throughout the plant probably trigger a
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of secondary messenger
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there has been evidence that when
you get these types of priming responses
[SPEAKER_01]: with let's say another fungal infection
I've read about is botrytis, you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's sometimes terpene expression
that changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a host of other secondary
messages that come out of the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system that begin to respond to
infection like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, to further complicate
the matter, you'll find a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: literature out there that show
co-infections of botrytis and PM or
[SPEAKER_01]: Fusarium in botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems that once the immune system is
down... Everybody piles on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone piles on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually was a really
complicating factor for us in trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence this genome because so many times
we were trying to scrape these spores off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could almost do it with a glass slide
and get all types of powder on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to lyse those spores and
sequence the genome and we always get
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always get like penicillium or all
these other co-infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because they happen to lyse
more readily than the spores and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us a long time of figuring out how
to wash those spores off and then you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to really treat them with phenol to
actually crack them open to get the DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: and to sequence it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you finally do have that
genome, it's never a perfectly pure genome
[SPEAKER_01]: of just powdery mildew spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some other contaminants
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make matters worse, these genomes
tend to be about 100 to 180 million bases
[SPEAKER_01]: in size, but they're 90% transposable
elements, meaning it's repetitive as all
[SPEAKER_01]: hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to put the genome
back together once you do finally get the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been a bit of a frustrating
rabbit hole to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we only really needed one really
unique stretch of DNA in the genome that
[SPEAKER_01]: we could anchor a PCR target for to pick
this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately, we don't have to ask
people to go and do this magical spore
[SPEAKER_01]: prep that we were talking about to pick up
the mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium network is really easy to
crack and easy to lyse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just do that with a single core,
like a hole punch of a leaf and a four
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeter hole punch of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually put two of those into each boil
and we just boil that DNA and it pops open
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium network and we get enough DNA
to then pick it up with one of our color
[SPEAKER_01]: metric assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a PCR assay that changes color on
you so that you don't need a detector for
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you can run it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it really idiot proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, like a pregnancy
test, it's plus minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very quantitative at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it changes color on you,
we still don't have a good correlation
[SPEAKER_01]: with that color change to how intensely
infected the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people really want is like,
well, give me an estimate of the colony
[SPEAKER_01]: forming units you might get as a
comparison with this amount of DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't have those because we
can't culture this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're thinking about even making a
quantitative version of it just for more
[SPEAKER_01]: research purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's just dialed in to be
as sensitive as we can get it with this
[SPEAKER_01]: color metric assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will get triggered by a single cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That much we know because we've targeted
this at a part of the genome as a really
[SPEAKER_01]: high copy number.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 50 copies of this region of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a single score or a single cell will
give us 50 targets to amplify from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to give it quite a lot of
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump back to when you were talking
about how it spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you describe this stress event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that if there are growers,
I mean, they know what causes their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are those always going to be the same
things that causes the spore to stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: What specifically can make up the stress
event that will cause the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: spores to pop and spread throughout the
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whatever those stresses are,
as a grower, we'd want to reduce those to
[SPEAKER_00]: as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things that I've heard about,
I don't have as much experience growing as
[SPEAKER_01]: many people in your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've been reading about through
my book warming efforts here on this
[SPEAKER_01]: genome is that it's usually a humidity
effect or a temperature effect that
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also been very fascinated in the
microbiome in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of evidence that
trichoderma and other bacillus species can
[SPEAKER_01]: knock this thing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't be surprised if your root
microbiome isn't healthy that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a nutrient deficiency of some sort
that may not be completely evident by a
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf color change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may be deficient nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can also trigger stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the best bio controls that are
mentioned in the literature are,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, using trichoderma, which is
another fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it happens to make chitinases and
other enzymes that go and destroy this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are probably what are being
emulated in a lot of these products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are on the shelves that are not
pesticidal-based, but are more
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more enzyme and bio control agents
that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a matter of fact, people who are
into living soils and probiotics and
[SPEAKER_00]: producing their own labs and using milk
instead of chemicals, I mean, this really
[SPEAKER_00]: does seem the direction that everybody's
going because a lot of the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-mold, anti-fungals that people have
used on plants in the past, no one wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to touch that stuff anymore because it's
going to ding them at a pesticide test at
[SPEAKER_00]: the state level, and suddenly they're
going to lose their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people seem to be more and more moving
to work in tune with nature to rebalance
[SPEAKER_00]: their leaf or to just straight out knock
out the mold spores that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think it's very key right now
with all the extraction we have going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen all these wonderful papers from
many of the people who have been on your
[SPEAKER_01]: cast before, whether it be Jeff Raber or
Ethan Russo, that these pesticides tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper-enrich in extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we may get a couple, three or
four-fold increase in the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're seeing 100 to 1,000-fold
enrichments for some of these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people using myclobutanol will fight
this, we really should change practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one challenge in changing those
practices is that if you do move to some
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, you have to be very careful of
what microbial test people are running
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of those probiotics are
going to trigger your total aerobic counts
[SPEAKER_01]: or your total yeast and mold counts are
going to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really need to work with the
regulators to not penalize people for
[SPEAKER_01]: these organic practices because
trichoderma and bacillus shouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_01]: human threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't be something that elevates
your petri film counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a lot of work on that side of the
fence as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make quantitative PCR assays for
microbial testing that a lot of the labs
[SPEAKER_01]: use in many of the states, and they tend
to be dialed in and fairly specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, our total yeast and mold test we
have specifically does not hit PM and
[SPEAKER_01]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it did, it would probably fail 30%
of the samples out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That test, we've made sure the primers
don't hit those because they're not human
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just plant pathogens, and we can
have separate tests to pick them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want to pick those up at a
different time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not interested in whether you have
botrytis or powdery mildew after you've
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too late then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know about that maybe six
weeks to eight weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've consciously broken apart
those tests so that they have different
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivities and they can be used at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got a lot more to talk about
powdery mildew, but it's time to take our
[SPEAKER_00]: first short break and read right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Kevin McKernan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief Science Officer at Medicinal
Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Kevin McKernan,
Chief Science Officer at Medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we were talking a
lot about powdery mildew and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, you know, some of the
rumors about how it is spread versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth and the science of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gotta ask, you know, a lot of us
have leaf hoppers, those little bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, technically if we got
inundated with leaf hoppers, they do suck
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the plant and they would be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally there's not enough to cause a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of growers are suspicious
of leaf hoppers because they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are moving the spores from leaf to
leaf and then plant to plant and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: acting as an agent for powdery mildew to
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you buy that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have read that russet mites may do
something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had a place, an educated guess,
I'd say yes, that they could be spreading
[SPEAKER_01]: these things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be one mechanism for moving
more than just powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a host of other diseases
that I wouldn't be surprised if I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: move around that way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then how about the other, gosh,
I went to say old wives tales,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that doesn't make any sense because I
know a lot of old wives and all they say
[SPEAKER_00]: is brilliant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I've got another myth and a
lot of people remove it with their
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, I went through the
whole plant and I rubbed it with my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and now I don't see any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always thought that, yeah,
you're removing the white, but you've just
[SPEAKER_00]: you've just spread it around so you can't
see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to what advantage does rubbing it off
with your fingers help at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll give you an anecdote about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that would completely purify
it from the plant just because these
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium networks get built in and spread
pretty quickly and you can't see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that would stay around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually you have to almost
imagine that network is like being an
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspen stand where all the roots are
connected and they can sprout genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: similar things out of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's kind of what these mycelium
networks are, is they're creating this
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric from which it can grow spores at a
later stress event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be why that might remove a lot of
the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably a good practice just to
lower the spore count inside the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and definitely clean your hands and don't
touch anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other plants after you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be surprised if they could if
they could pop back out at a later
[SPEAKER_01]: stressor event when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably be more inclined that
maybe the sulfur treatments or these other
[SPEAKER_01]: milk based treatments, which I'm assuming
what the milk's doing is putting
[SPEAKER_01]: lactobacillus in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably does a better job eating
away that network and destroying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are probably I bet more hardy
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one story they give some folks a sense
of sensitivity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one group here that was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a there's a company called Curated
Leaf that runs our chemistry here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went to one group grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tested 30 mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the mothers was positive for
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then then went and tested was a 25 of
the descendants, the clones off that
[SPEAKER_01]: mother and two of those pop positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they've pulled the mother and the
two clones and then quarantine those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that gives you a sense of the sampling
challenges we might find with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that if it's if it's at a very low spore
counts or a very low frequency in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, it may not be all over the entire
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be in one side of the plant
that happened to get a little bit damper
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the corner it was facing or
something and managed to start colonizing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they cut clones from that,
a couple of the clones ended up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does travel just in the cloning
process alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that I think people
have to just keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, and in reverse,
when you mentioned that there's a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: room in one of the of the 25 plants tested
possible positive for powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that chances are there's
powdery mildew on all of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the spore counts are so low that they
just didn't come up on the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could it could have been that or
it could there could be more resistance as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of the resistance literature
in a rapidopsis, which is a model
[SPEAKER_01]: organism, and that we're looking at in
hops, there's six different genetic loci
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been identified in hops that are
pointing towards their resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the resistance is that we
think that the stoma or stomata are
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller in some of the ones that are
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder for them to get that
historia or that taproot into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other ones are just about enzymes that
the plant happens to make that might fight
[SPEAKER_01]: off this infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a host of different ways in
which the plant, this is a hops plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, but if you draw some of those
parallels to cannabis, you have to imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: there may be more than one genetic
resistance loci in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some might actually get infected,
but never actually express the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they may just have it on the leaves,
but it's not actually affecting them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they either have, you know,
some some magic chemical on the leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we what we're trying to do with the
test is make sure that we we don't crack
[SPEAKER_01]: open too many spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the spores to remain hardy and
probably be missed by the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want the test to be picking up
the mycelium network, which we know is a
[SPEAKER_01]: sign of successful infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's that's kind of what we've
been aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing gears a little bit,
you know, we all want to avoid powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew because it stresses out the plant,
which eventually decreases yield and might
[SPEAKER_00]: take down the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one likes to harvest a plant and
have it go poof with powdery mildew on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers afterwards, because that just that
the experience is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what actually happens to a human if we
smoke flour that has been dried and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got powdery mildew and we and we
combust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only things that we've seen tied to
powdery mildew in human health is maybe an
[SPEAKER_01]: allergenic response.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not listed as human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is the reason why we don't
have them on our other tests or ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking for human pathogens like E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, seminal and aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, aspergillus, there have been
cases of people inhaling those spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can get aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one patient in Toronto had
this happen to them maybe last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was published.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient survived, but they got a
pneumothorax and it was really hairy
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually aspergillus in immunocompromised
patients has like a 50 percent mortality
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be very serious if you get those
types of spores in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't powdery mildew spores and
powdery mildew spores are probably our
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies are probably quite used to them
because they're on a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not that we're smoking those
things, but we're certainly ingesting lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of other fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the powdery mildew seem to be quite
common amongst many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've not found any literature and I
encourage anyone to forward stuff if they
[SPEAKER_01]: can find it that suggested that this is
actually a human health concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more just I think the cosmetics and
perhaps it might change the flavor and the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles and of course affect the
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there isn't, I think, any evidence to
be alarmed of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the the lore is that you
always want to avoid PM when producing for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that it is just simply
because of having a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of allergic reaction just sounds
a lot less serious than mold spores
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the lungs, which is how most
people normally talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it like, you know, taking up
residence there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that can be very serious for
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree in those cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe some people don't have the eye
to tell the difference between the two of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can tell the difference very,
very evidently with DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does most post harvest processing
remove it like ethanol or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using hydrocarbon extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this will this just kill the mold
spores but leave the the remaining spore
[SPEAKER_00]: material there but but inactive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine most extraction systems
would obliterate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've not there's a few folks in the
field trying to look at that question
[SPEAKER_01]: whether the extraction systems actually
just destroy the spores or whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: make it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I had to place money on it,
I bet ethanol extractions would would melt
[SPEAKER_01]: most of these things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people have been
talking about that great Jorge Cervantes
[SPEAKER_00]: video that's been going around showing him
giving his flowers with PM a hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide bath that's eight ounces of H2O2
to a five gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he takes the flowers that and
then and then washes them kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: submerges them and jostles them around a
little bit and then hangs them to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, since we all try to avoid
mold generally and water on our plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: it totally looks crazy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really have to make sure that you
dry them well so that it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what are your thoughts of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a pretty effective way to remove
PM from your flowers if you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: especially high ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we saw a lot of the grows here
resorting to that when they when they just
[SPEAKER_01]: opened up and had a big problem with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were starting to resort to some of
this hydrogen peroxide treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they did notice a hit in the
terpenes, however, which is probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: that surprising with hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the terpene profile may change
with that treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know what happens with yield
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do you end up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine with a PM infection,
you're not getting perhaps the you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the best growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's busy trying to find infection
as opposed to making incredible colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there may be just a yield issue as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you mentioned it, and I know this
is purely speculative because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's been any studies on this,
but you suggested that H2O2 would likely
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, regardless of the terpene test being
higher or lower, what scientifically do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about hydrogen peroxide would
threaten terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just oxidative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine some of the terpenes will get
oxidized with hydrogen peroxide treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which may change limonene and terpenelene
or a few of the ones that are that may be
[SPEAKER_01]: more susceptible to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to look into that more
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then so then the last question before
we move on to botrytis is prevention,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the best the best cure is
to not get it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we know that there's probably some
amount of PM on just about every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, does you create an
opportunity for the powdery mildew to take
[SPEAKER_00]: over and increase the spore counts on any
particular plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do as a preventative so
that we keep those spore counts
[SPEAKER_00]: negligible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a bit of a self-fulfilling
plug here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we've been pitching is to screen
for these this stuff genetically and use
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a mechanism to perhaps accelerate
your breeding toward resistant lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you can screen all your plants
that the ones that are that are starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to build up and PM and now you're not
going to this is before you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: see the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you can see the powder on it's too
late that their spores are there and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by that time, you're in emergency
mode trying to chop stuff down and treat
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But prior to that, while these things are
potentially incubating and building these
[SPEAKER_01]: mysium networks, you could be screening
for the plants that are that are
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to it and remove those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by default, the ones that are
left over are more likely to have
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance genetics and keep breeding
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we view it as an opportunity to do some
some selective breeding based on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, plant pathogens that are that
are present that you can find via the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as so that's how you can get
rid of it long term through selective
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like our best solution in
the short term, if you're if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with an acute situation,
is going to labs, you know, keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: hostile environment to those spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your labs in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both in the soil and foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't actually have a good answer
for how it may blow your spore tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's something that we're going
to have to change in the regulations so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can continue to use labs for
probiotic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the challenge is if you go to a
lab that's using petri films, powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew doesn't grow in petri films.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to be blind to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, trichoderma, which you might want
to consider using to get rid of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow on those films.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a bit of a double edged sword
there that you might the right thing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably probiotics, but you're
probably going to get penalized for it if
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab is using a culture based system to
to track this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely something we're going to have
to all be active around with both lab
[SPEAKER_00]: technique and also how the regulations are
put in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not digging the wrong people for
first for spores that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I think California got this
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think their most recent regs I've seen
is a very species specific on the human
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a test for that that's
multiplexed into two different
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's four different
aspergillus species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have tests for all four of those as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there isn't anything in there like a
total aerobic count or total yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank God, because those very broad
tests, they're they're reading tea leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really not telling you what's
beneficial versus what's harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we used to have in Washington
until just last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We changed to more along the lines of what
California is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, usually this time of year,
people will first swear about powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and that'll follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next person in line will swear about
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a drag to watch a gorgeous
cola growing at the top of a plant only to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it crumble in your hands because it's
rotted from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the inside without you knowing,
you know, just makes you cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so what is botrytis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's another mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this one was sequenced by the
Whitehead Institute many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's already a genome sequenced for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to cross to different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a botrytis scenario, which is
mostly found in on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at least a test that we've been
building forward is toward that toward
[SPEAKER_01]: that genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have handed us botrytis
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tests are positive for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it's it is also something that can
get to the seeds, which is something where
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't believe can happen with powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the literature, at least in hops,
is that P. macularis is unlikely to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis, however, seems like it can get
into the seeds and it can also survive the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's it's perhaps a little bit of a
tougher one to get rid of in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a testing standpoint, we are still
doing leaf punches to try and pick this
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may not we may have to change
that because it doesn't always seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: show itself up in the leaves like powdery
mildew does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is believed to be systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one where there's really good
literature around botrytis scenario
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into the vasculature of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why you can see it in the
center of the buds, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's infected, it's it's you know,
it's inside out in terms of its its
[SPEAKER_01]: display.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a little bit of a different
beast and sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably harder to deal with in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for somebody who is new to it,
I mean, just about anybody who's grown a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop or two has has seen botrytis and can
I identify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it you know, it's a big old bear
in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to miss once you know
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for somebody who's relatively new to
working with the plants, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify botrytis visually without going
into a lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's, you know, Horay has great
pictures of this in his cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: encyclopedia of what botrytis can look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even so you can even sometimes
see it on stems as like little gray spots
[SPEAKER_01]: in the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even gotten the DNA test to pick it
up positive on some leaves that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: look like they were infected with any
fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still learning about I think
about how early this infects things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what I've read is it also has
a DPI of like 18 to 30 days, days post
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, meaning that it can stay
unnoticed the human eye for that period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time before it begins to show phenotypes
that we can detect with maybe a magnifying
[SPEAKER_01]: loop or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the I've had some plants test
positive where I would have never thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it had it had discovered leaves that were
little necrotic here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, there's botrytis in
there starting to get foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet when some of those plants
mature, they're going to it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out in full force.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this one might be a little bit
harder for people to eyeball because I do
[SPEAKER_01]: think it has a variety of different ways
in which it can it can show itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take our second short
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we will continue
talking about botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Kevin McKernan,
chief science officer and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We humans are attracted to plants because
they offer us relief and are a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, though, the best parts are
buried inside the plant and we need to use
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to cannabis, it is
extraordinarily important to extract its
[SPEAKER_00]: precious oils without changing them in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to preserve the properties of the
cannabinoids, terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents that all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 1994, Eden Labs has been developing
extraction technology and processes to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs was founded by a cannabis loving
engineer during the early days of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in California, and the expanded
Eden team has been designing and building
[SPEAKER_00]: industry leading solutions for cannabis
extraction ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs flagship product is the newly
improved high flow CO2 extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As other extraction companies enter the
market, it is the high flow from Eden Labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone chases and tries to compare
themselves with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the improved automation
software allows data to be collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: stored and studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs can outfit your whole lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden's cold finger ethanol extractor
creates astonishing whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: working alone or in tandem with an initial
stream distilling step to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes before extracting the rest of
the botanical constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden offers you many options, including
vacuum distillation, column distilling,
[SPEAKER_00]: stirred reactor units and accelerated
solvent recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you partner with Eden Labs,
your lab team is enrolled into the Eden
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs training program to boost their
understanding of Eden's best practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that your outputs are exactly what
you require for your application,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be dab oil, oil for pen
cartridges or edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work with Eden, you're not just
buying the tech, you're buying dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: customer support to help you attain your
business goals too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eden's CEO, A.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Braddock talk about the company values
during Shaping Fire episode 19 that was
[SPEAKER_00]: all about CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the new companies in the market
just smell opportunity, slap an extractor
[SPEAKER_00]: together and hire a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden Labs has been listening to feedback
from extractors and consumers for about 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about both you and your
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner with Eden Labs to extract
astonishing cannabis oils and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll be proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow cannabis with sunshine,
you can often feel limited by the seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow sustainably and save
money, so you use as little electricity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you haven't studied or implemented
light deprivation techniques into your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you're leaving a lot of money
on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: By incorporating light deprivation
solutions into your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can often add two or three additional
growing cycles to your year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pencil out the financial benefit
of those additional cycles, you'll realize
[SPEAKER_00]: why commercial scale light deprivation
technology is remaking the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What used to be done by pulling tarps over
hoop houses has been scaled up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years in such a way that it's
become mechanized, easy and affordable to
[SPEAKER_00]: even small scale commercial cannabis
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering Greenhouses is the
industry leader in light deprivation
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse design and operation for the
commercial cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their team of greenhouse experts have been
in the fields of Northern California for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and they're now building
greenhouses for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to light dep and growing in
greenhouses, I encourage you to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire Episode 13 with guest Eric
Branstad of Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with Eric about the importance of
intelligent greenhouse management,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the huge financial benefit of
incorporating light dep techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many aspects of utilizing a
greenhouse that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: From temperature and airflow to light dep
and workflow, Forever Flowering will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce crop after crop of well cared
for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you retrofit your existing
greenhouse with light dep and other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: systems at a level that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just starting out, Forever
Flowering can help you plan and build your
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse so that you get started on
the right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis business has enough risks
without trying to go it alone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact Forever Flowering Greenhouses to
partner with folks who have an
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable reputation as knowledgeable
and easy to work with.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Kevin McKernan,
Chief Science Officer at Medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when people first see
botrytis, when people are in their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal gardens, a lot of folks will just
pinch off that small amount of botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: that they see with the idea of,
oh, you know, I really don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the whole cola or this whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to pinch this little bit
off and I'm going to take it away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and just like hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in personal gardens,
sometimes you can get away with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question for you is, are we just
fooling ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's already a little bit on
the plant, is it already everywhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant is doomed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How bad is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a perfect question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was someone that this happened to
this summer on and there was parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: their plant that looked like they could
salvage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other ones that they broke off and
threw it into the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we went and DNA tested the stuff
that was clearly just covered in mold and
[SPEAKER_01]: also the stuff that they thought was
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found botrytis DNA in all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they opted to take the clean stuff and
then go extract it and see if they could
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it into something other than a
smokable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really don't know if they had
continued to grow that plant for another
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two, whether they would have just
shown up in the other flowers or not and
[SPEAKER_01]: really sprouted there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they saw it break out like this,
they kind of killed the thing and started
[SPEAKER_01]: tearing apart the parts that they thought
they could salvage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did see DNA in all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I really don't have any advice on
the biocontrol of this other than what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can probably find in a lot of the other
recommended books about using trichoderma
[SPEAKER_01]: and other types of yeast to try and take
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that makes me way more
suspicious of botrytis than powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: is because it is systemic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you see a little bit of
botrytis on a flower and you pinch it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are mechanically removing the spores
from the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, it's already in
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's already inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, you're just doing an aesthetic
thing at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there is an interesting
paper I'll point people to in tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they deploy hexanoic acid under the
root ball of tomatoes and it primes the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to defend itself against botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hexanoic acid is a very interesting
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the first compound in
cannabinoid synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hexanoic acid pathway is what is,
it's arguably a precursor to these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, tomatoes don't make that,
but hexanoic acid, I think, in other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is a signaling molecule of the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an interesting paper because they
actually carbon label the hexanoic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show it's not actually getting passed
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's doing some type of cellular
communication with the plant to prime the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system to fight off botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not only get that paper from you,
folks will be able to look on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: page for this episode and get most of the
papers that you're referring to,
[SPEAKER_00]: including a link to that great Rob Clark
book about- Oh, yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: ... mDiseases.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go the opposite side,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a, we were just
talking about pinching it off in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about an indoor commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you find a plant that is
expressing botrytis and we know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic, it would sound like you would
want to bag that plant, cut it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it the hell out of your indoor
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my tendency because once
these spores start to go, they move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we talked about how powdery
mildew, other than some potential
[SPEAKER_00]: allergies, it's not really all that bad
for humans, even though we all try to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid it because it's just kind of
generally gross and poor aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it go for botrytis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, certainly it tastes bad and it
causes you to cough, but how does botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the human?
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing I've read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just allergenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen botrytis as being a health
hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone has any papers to show us
otherwise, we were all ears, but we have
[SPEAKER_01]: been searching for any evidence of that
and have opted to not have it be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: human pathogen panel as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The allergy part of it is certainly plenty
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that when I come across
some botrytis in a flower, when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, let's say, and I didn't know it
was coming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see it and I pick it up and it
hits something and it's under the light
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden it goes poof,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spores are everywhere and of
course I'm inhaling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh man, time to take a step
outside and get some fresh air because
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff's really gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that even though, you know,
it may not be bad for humans, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly unpleasant to my human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are fairly ubiquitous as well
in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it really comes down to are
they immunocompromised or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those cases, maybe the allergenic
reaction is probably more severe of a
[SPEAKER_01]: concern than what a healthy individual
might have from just environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure to spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now for a light infection of a
botrytis, you know, an advanced botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: infection on a flower, I mean,
the poor flower just melts and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing left in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some plants, they'll get just a little
bit of a botrytis and folks will set those
[SPEAKER_00]: aside to be processed either into a
topical or maybe they'll micro filter it
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn it into a tincture or something,
though that would be arguably sketchy as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is, is that when you process
it with ethanol or with hydrocarbons,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it kill the spore but leave the spore
plant material just like it does with
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question as to whether or not,
you know, which extraction techniques do
[SPEAKER_01]: what to the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would assume the spores are
the things that are probably the hardiest
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they may survive some of the
extraction techniques that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen any studies done on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that really is
a drag about about botrytis, especially up
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the in the northwest, is that down
in Oregon, where they have a very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and financially successful Riesling
harvest, they actually spray it outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: on dessert wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually call it noble rot because it
makes it makes dessert wines taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then the wind blows it up
here in the northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, as if we don't have
enough trouble with mold just because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so wet up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're, you know, it's it's
they're spraying in botrytis down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon and it blows up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly we've got their noble rot,
which we've got a lot of swear words for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in the wine industry, this
actually helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is used quite oftenly for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I should say I have heard of
some folks who have been working in indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grows where they've been chronically
exposed to high spore counts and feels if
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gotten some type of allergy or or
or lung infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't want to proclaim
that this stuff is all is all rosy for
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there can be cases, I imagine,
where you're if you're stuffed in a in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room that doesn't have the right
ventilation, you're constantly working
[SPEAKER_01]: around a high spore count.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably going to aggravate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so similarly to P.M.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're not big on the
prevention side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you believe in the prevention
side, but it's not really the focus of
[SPEAKER_00]: your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that an approach of spraying
labs foliarly would help against botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same ways that powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foliar sprays, whether they would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where a lot of this is
going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that once we have the genome sequence
of all of the pests that that have in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, well, then it's just a question
of finding the genomic Achilles heel and
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting these things with RNA or hitting
these things with other enzymes that might
[SPEAKER_01]: actually target the weakness that you can
see in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these foliar sprays ideally would be
for molecules that are ephemeral,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like enzymes biodegrade over time
and RNA molecules degrade over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these types of approaches,
I think, are showing a lot of promise in
[SPEAKER_01]: other in other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can work in a rapid opsis,
if you can find an economic monoflame to
[SPEAKER_01]: work in $2 a pound tomatoes, you can find
an economic monoflame to work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a great approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm at it, I want to plug the
Facebook group, the Probiotic Farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge- I love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got like 20,000 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn how to make labs
and lactobacilli and others that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: protect your plants, you can Google it
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that group, it's moderated really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of pros on that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Probiotic Farmers Alliance,
shout out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin, I know I'm catching you off
guard with this last question,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have got a lot of depth in both
powdery mildew and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, as an interviewer, I can only
really ask you questions on things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come across and know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in your head about either or both
of those that I haven't asked you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your head, you're like,
oh man, this would be a good thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw into the mix as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe Shango doesn't know to ask you
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I not asking you, and I should,
about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say that- So we've sequenced
a genome of one powdery mildew that
[SPEAKER_01]: infects cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm somewhat suspicious there may be a
second genome out there, only because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we've seen with wheat and rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is two different or three different
strains of bloomaria that are powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews that infect those grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants have evolved different
resistance to each one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're somewhat eager to see if there's
another powdery mildew out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: infects cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis having such a global spread,
it would surprise me if there were just
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we've tested a lot of material
from California and from the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a little bit in Canada,
but we haven't really gotten to any
[SPEAKER_01]: international markets with the test yet to
know whether the powdery mildew in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, or in Afghanistan is the
same species as what we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is there is a
tremendous amount of confusion in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature over the taxonomic class of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's a great book from Roger
T.
[SPEAKER_01]: A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cook, I would point people to,
on the taxonomic manual of powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a huge book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what will frustrate you about this
book is if you look at all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: species that are categorizing in here,
they all look the same by eye,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be a little bit overwhelming
when you realize there's this many powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews out there and they all look the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I actually dealing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So going forward, we're looking to expand
the testing venue from just botrytis and
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew onto anything that affects
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if folks have ideas and tests that we
should target, we have a long list of
[SPEAKER_01]: things we're going down and making assays
for from fusarium to pythium to brownie
[SPEAKER_01]: mildews, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in these books that we're
reading about, we're trying to make assays
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we always want to hear from growers as
to what they're actually running into.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the problems that are really
causing them economic harm so that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: make assays that detect them very early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we think early detection is the
key to finding both resistance genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to just preventing grows from
getting knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that there may be a novel PM
that's specific for cannabis is really an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably really like the other ones,
but it's just got a small difference that
[SPEAKER_00]: is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point would nature have developed
this novel version of PM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it go all the way back to the land
races or is this something that probably
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened once we all started
hybridizing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll link you guys another paper to the
Blumeria paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hypothesize that this is happening
during domestication of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That when you domesticate them,
you tend to take the plants out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding where they have a lot of other
species where there might be more hopping
[SPEAKER_01]: going on into more of a monoculture
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, these obligate
biotrophs tend to speciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's their thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it could be just that this dates
back to when mankind decided to take
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis under its wing and along with it,
its pathogens decided to evolve according
[SPEAKER_01]: to new agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and yet
more evidence against monocropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculturing and in favor of
permaculturing and companion plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
