[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there and welcome to the third Shaping
Fire Sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host from Shaping Fire Shango
Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first Shaping Fire Session was with
Kevin Jodry and our second was with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Russo and now our third one here
today starts with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Lowenfels is a big proponent of the
soil food web and using living soil when
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the author of the trilogy of books
which are kind of the cornerstone for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people of cannabis living soil
which is teeming with microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: teeming with nutrients, and teeming with
fungi and he also has got a new book
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out on October 22nd in 2019 this
year all on auto flowers and so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find links to all those books down in the
video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the next three weeks we're going to
be publishing a series of interviews that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did with Jeff Lowenfels on the soil
food web and what's going on inside your
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil when you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a handful of questions that I
didn't think were addressed properly
[SPEAKER_01]: enough in cannabis and so I asked Jeff if
I could ask him these very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that we could all use answers to
and he's like yeah and I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got together and we recorded this
series for you and we hope you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to give special thanks to Patrick
Smith and Green Bicycles who is the
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor for this series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry actually turned me on to Green
Bicycles one time when I was visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all like man this is the compost tea
we use on all my farms it's awesome we
[SPEAKER_01]: rely on it and I'm like hey that's good
enough for me so I picked up some and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been using it for a few years with great
results as well and Patrick Smith is a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice guy and so you know nice guy
good product so check it out and we
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate that his willingness to sponsor
this and make this happen.

[SPEAKER_01]: there that you won't find anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right here we go with the first video
Jeff Lowenfels shaping fire sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff thank you so much for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know one of the things I wanted to
start with is that you know mulching cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and top dressing are all very
popular for really good reasons but
[SPEAKER_00]: mulching sometimes we can run into some
problems because if we mulch soil that is
[SPEAKER_00]: already unbalanced sometimes the mulch can
add to that the lack of balance and make
[SPEAKER_00]: things even even worse and so what I'm
keeping by tying up nutrients and so my
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you is how can we best use
mulch with cannabis for for the best
[SPEAKER_00]: plants we can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay well first let me go back and correct
what I think is sort of a misstatement
[SPEAKER_02]: most people are really hung up on the idea
that if you have a mulch layer that the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil microbes will go into the mulch rob
the soil of all sorts of nutrients as they
[SPEAKER_02]: as they use the energy that they need to
work up that mulch that's that's you know
[SPEAKER_02]: ties up the nutrients in theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it does to a certain extent but
just at that layer the interface between
[SPEAKER_02]: the mulch and the soil so it's really not
sucking up all the nutrients out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and tying everything up it's just
that little layer it's it's sort of like
[SPEAKER_02]: pH if I can digress just a little bit
we're concerned about pH but the only area
[SPEAKER_02]: where pH really counts is right around the
rhizosphere right around the root up on
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface who cares what the pH is
within degrees and it's the same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the mulch if if you've got a layer of
mulch you're going to lose a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient just at that interface but down
where the roots are you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question then becomes what kind of
mulch is the right kind of mulch to use
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis and and I like to use a mulch
that that generates more bacteria than
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this conversation has been going on
for a while and I have been told although
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't spoken directly with her that
Dr. Elaine thinks a little bit more fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm suggesting makes sense and as I
think about it I'm still on the bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: side a green mulch would be bacterial.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fungal comes in for the plants that
take a long time to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking auto flowers those are
quick those are clearly bacterial to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something that's got a lot
of Afghani in it that got a lot of you
[SPEAKER_02]: know long-term growth it takes six months
you know then you might want to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more fungal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always need some fungal in the soil so
the mulch that I like is is a is a green
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch I'll use actual grass clippings and
straw and hay you know got to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds obviously if I'm going to be using
my soil again and just some leaves I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: throw in there but I definitely mulch all
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people don't want to use their
dead leaves from the cannabis plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil because they think oh it's necrotic
and there's something wrong with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm putting in my soil whereas others
are all like the cannabis plant already
[SPEAKER_00]: has the key nutrients is makes the best
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I believe in what's known as the law
of return.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason why we fertilize plants is
because we harvest the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to fall down from the plant decay
and regenerate the soil and you know so we
[SPEAKER_02]: take the flowers we take we take you know
the top sugar leaves I am a big believer
[SPEAKER_02]: in letting the rest of the plant including
the roots go into that soil and become
[SPEAKER_02]: part of your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that I guess that makes sense like
a tree right because you know without
[SPEAKER_00]: man's involvement or human involvement the
tree itself will just drop its leave and
[SPEAKER_00]: it provides its own mulch for the next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah I mean it really is called the
law of return and I'm trying to if I can
[SPEAKER_02]: remember the name of the oh gosh it'll
come to me sometime but but you know back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the day when when NPK was invented
artificial manures etc etc they realized
[SPEAKER_02]: that what was happening was we were
removing all of the great stuff from the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact this is why the United States
manifest destiny was really all about
[SPEAKER_02]: getting better soil because we were
removing all of the nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil not putting anything back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That only occurred when we came and
started taking stuff from the plants as
[SPEAKER_02]: they continue to drop stuff they feed
themselves they continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say nobody ever fertilizes the
redwoods and they get that thing so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: we digress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure thank you.
you
