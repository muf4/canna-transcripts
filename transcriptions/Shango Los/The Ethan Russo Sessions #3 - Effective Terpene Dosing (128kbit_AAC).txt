[SPEAKER_00]: So Ethan, you know, we're starting to see
terpenes added into everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For better, for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're just trying to make a
product taste a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're actually adding
terpenes, like, oh, we've added,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, citrine to this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make you happy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other folks are just straight up
adding terpenes to, you know, dabble oils
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different
implementations of terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that people ask me all the
time is, at what point does a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: become effective in the human body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a threshold point where you
haven't had enough of the terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't had enough of the terpene,
and then at some point you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is your threshold point where you
get the advantages of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somewhere up here, suddenly now
the terpene is doing less well for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about extensively,
but this area, to know when a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: added to a product is actually giving me
any benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would we weigh that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's difficult, but a good gauge
would be someone finds a chemivore for
[SPEAKER_01]: which they like the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that they're vaporizing a chemivore,
they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a good thing to extract to
make an edible product, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly an advantage for someone who
had a chronic condition where they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to dose effectively two or
three times a day as opposed to many times
[SPEAKER_01]: a day if they were vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the problem, and the reason this
has come about is there's been a big move,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in Washington State,
towards concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the state, 60% of sales now are
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But often these have developed an
imbalance, some particularly with the CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts to some degree as well with
butene extracts, which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting upwards of 70, even 90% THC
to the exclusion of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a situation where even an
experienced cannabis user might take one
[SPEAKER_01]: hit of a concentrate and pass out from
what's called orthostatic hypotension,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it's a slow down,
they're hard enough that they can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: blood flow to the brain and they hit the
deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that part's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But additionally, you've lost the
terpenoids because of the way that the
[SPEAKER_01]: material was concentrated and processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are ways around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrates rather should be made in a
way that preserves the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two common ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is with cold ethanol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this tends to get the terpenoids out
at the same time as the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tinctures, even though they're old
fashioned, remain a good way to extract
[SPEAKER_01]: and to store cannabis stably.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way is with CO2 extraction,
which is notorious for causing loss of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of doing one run that usually
will get the cannabinoids effectively,
[SPEAKER_01]: but lose a lot of the terpenoids,
is to do one run aimed at extracting each
[SPEAKER_01]: and then combining them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes longer, but would be a
better way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the amounts, everything is
relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one analysis of things that
tried to demonstrate how potent terpenoids
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It indicated that a concentration of 0.1%
can have a measurable effect, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: really didn't say how that was
administered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at how terpenoids are most
effective, certainly they are on
[SPEAKER_01]: inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think most people realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also effective when applied on the
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the basis of aromatherapy
massage.
[SPEAKER_01]: People shouldn't think that this is
witchcraft because you can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: measurable levels of the terpenoids in the
serum after application on the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are somewhat less effective orally,
but that's not to say that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people shouldn't shy away from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, we need to see higher
amounts of terpenoids in cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be easy to exceed the necessary
concentrations if they're added from an
[SPEAKER_01]: external source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that at the heart of
this is customer and patient education,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the market is providing these 70%,
80% THC oils because when people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: in, they want the most bang for their
buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they look for the highest THC
content, not realizing that as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your THC content, you're
lessening the space available for the
[SPEAKER_00]: minor cannabinoids and the terpenes and
especially CBD, which will help moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually make your THC high more
pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what would you recommend as far as
trying to, I don't know, backfill the
[SPEAKER_00]: market to perhaps reach patients so that
maybe the demand changes so that what's
[SPEAKER_00]: being brought to the market is changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this conversation with many bud
tenders and the average consumer goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis dispensary and usually asks for
the highest THC available.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good bud tender will try to disabuse
them of the notion that this is what they
[SPEAKER_01]: really want and try to explain that the
quality of their experience might be a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better with a more balanced chemivore.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD has somewhat of a reputation as a
buzzkill, but this really isn't accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the olden days, more often cannabis had
a balance between THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was still pleasurable for people
in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a tremendous amount of CBD,
usually given before THC, to totally
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate its ability to produce a high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, what it will do when they're used
in conjunction is it might blunt the peak
[SPEAKER_01]: high somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also delays the onset of the peak high
and most importantly prolongs the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: effect so that people don't need to dose
as often, whether they are using it
[SPEAKER_01]: recreationally or to treat a specific
disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, with the other terpenoids,
these very much modulate the high of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: can reduce short-term memory impairment,
can reduce anxiety and all the other side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that we associate with too much
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on what the consumer
is seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But education can help a lot in guiding
people towards what might be better for
[SPEAKER_00]: their overall health and reduce problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, Budtenders, it sounds like it's up
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're our front lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teach the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
