[SPEAKER_00]: This episode on veganics is about a year
in the making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last January, I was in Southern California
to speak at the Greenflower Media Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Entrepreneur Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the first day of the event,
there was this incredible VIP party at the
[SPEAKER_00]: home of Erin and Erica Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erin and Erica are the owners of Bud and
Rose's cannabis dispensary in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party in a gated community was packed
with like seriously major players in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis industry all across the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this amazing spread of food and
the view of the mountains off their lanai
[SPEAKER_00]: was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I mentioned this party is
because they had this cannabis bar there
[SPEAKER_00]: with an array of flowers grown and sold by
the Bud and Rose's dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could do dabs or the
bartender would pack you a bowl or roll
[SPEAKER_00]: you a joint or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all, you know, very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing though is that each of the jars
were filled with incredible specimens of
[SPEAKER_00]: each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like the strawberry cough I
had was like the best strawberry cough I
[SPEAKER_00]: had ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, the black lime was the best
lime I had ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I went down the line of jars,
the various flowers had exceptional
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles and the ones I went ahead
and toked had a flavor that came right
[SPEAKER_00]: through the smoke, even though I was
combusting and not vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I had my first veganically
grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I knew of some folks that had
experimented on and off with veganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had heard folks talk about how clean
the tastes were, but I was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressed and caught off guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided that I needed to do a show
about veganics, both so I could learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and because I figured other
people would be interested too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So off I went to find a guest for the show
on veganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously Kyle Cushman is at the
top of that list because he puts out his
[SPEAKER_00]: line of bottled veganic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really wanted to do a show more from
a do-it-yourself probiotic direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Kyle was on the show, there'd be so
many other cool things to talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: we might not even ever get to veganic
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I searched the internet for a while and
never really found the right person to
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone used to grow veganic,
but now they include worm castings at
[SPEAKER_00]: least and some much more, like even fish
guts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually I went to my favorite place
to learn about probiotic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I posted for guest suggestions on the
Probiotic Farmers Alliance group on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most everyone's comment was that veganics
was not a thing and that some animal
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs were absolutely a necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Alan Adkisson of Grokashi posted
that there's this one guy to talk to who
[SPEAKER_00]: is an old-school probiotic grower,
breeder, and high times writer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and his name was Nebu.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's N-E-B-U.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took me a few weeks to find Nebu in
the underground, but I did find him
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and working in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's my guest today on Shaping for
Vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and today we're
going to talk about veganic growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's still a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Nebu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad that you could make some time
to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we know that organic growing
or natural growing is how it always was
[SPEAKER_00]: before synthetic fertilizers came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the time of better
living through chemistry happened and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, organic natural growing got
usurped by synthetics and chemicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: petroleum in inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays we're starting to come back
around a probiotic growing and living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the reigning headspace when you
first started writing for high times?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty accurate
observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen some memes where they
show black and white pictures and they say
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was grown organic back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think the reigning kind of
space when I first started with high times
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot of synthetic you know,
salt-based fertilizers, be it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydro was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do organic in hydro,
but that wasn't, it's not very convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit difficult and
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the synthetics were kind of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like bypassing all the
symbiotic relationship that happens with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbiome and just giving them,
you know, straight injections of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already broken down and can,
you know, penetrate the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that breaking everything
down in its individuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you get the basic components,
but you don't get the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like force feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the symbiotic relationship
that happens naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can overfeed really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can burn and, you know, you're missing
something here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately it reflects on the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you see it at farmers
markets or wherever you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grocery store, there's a big push for
organics, not only because of the ethical
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations and how it impacts the
environment, but really the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product is superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you can't really argue against
all the years of evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think the quality is really
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically on the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a big fan of probiotic flour,
but what would you say are the data points
[SPEAKER_00]: of quality that sets probiotic flours
apart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's going to be a difficult
thing because I don't think it will
[SPEAKER_01]: reflect in a lot of the tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to have to be a big
paradigm shift because people are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: like at THC percent and they're thinking
about it as alcohol percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, this flour has 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get completely blotto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're not looking at is
terpenes and all the entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's another symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they all work together and you can't
test for sativa versus indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no test that really tells you the
effect that that's going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've found is, and what I've
always bred for and grown for is really
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor and the profile, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, because I've always been against
the kind of couch lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a time and place for it
for indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want that, if you want
that really sedative type of effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's definitely a place for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, during the daytime,
I like to have sativas and those are more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also yield less and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, I guess I'm getting kind of far
field here, but just to bring it back,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've noticed is just the,
I guess the flavor, I would say in a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutshell, if you had to boil it down to
one thing, it's just the flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: the taste and the overall profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned the negative
inflected term salts for bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in researching veganics for
this show, you know, a lot of people were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking, you know, the kind of people who
are into veganics and probiotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: they talk a lot of trash about bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, would you talk a little bit to
why bottled nutrients are something that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are turning away from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've talked about it being the
individuated parts, but why may not that
[SPEAKER_00]: be as successful as building probiotic
communities in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it just boils down to a simple
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probiotic, that means life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow the Latin roots,
that's what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's what it's all about when you
want to grow in a natural environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: is having those, you know, having that
symbiosis, having those bacteria and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the beneficial microorganisms that help
break down and work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycorrhizae, fungal, bacteria that
grow roots or even grow mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all work together in a symbiotic
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really get that in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's deprived of oxygen and it will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can bottle it and it will last
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, shelf life is very,
very short on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bacteria are sort of sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need that environment that nurtures
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's something that you can't really
get from a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a lot of food that you can
feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take the bacteria from a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you can get your guanos and everything
else from a bottle and feed that to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you can't really get the life from
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I was first starting to
learn about growing in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: all anybody wanted to talk to me about was
NPK, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, if you got those three,
pump that, you know, plant full of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as I've matured into my
understanding of cannabis, I've realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's this whole community of
inputs that need to be there and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: make each other more bio accessible to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can grow decently with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have produced, you know,
decent plants with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they talk about flushing,
which is something, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get the salt fertilizers out of
the plant before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not a necessary step when
you're growing organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to flush anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all that has come from that NPK,
that chemical salt based fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: centric paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, yeah, it's really just not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it, like if somebody
doesn't flush and you're burning,
[SPEAKER_01]: I vaporize, so you can't tell as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're burning a flower,
I actually had an old friend of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: convince me to trade him some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still regret it to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back when I was still combusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of it burning to ash,
it kind of just melted into this black
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of chunk of coal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was just all,
it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was all the salts just burning and
melting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so obviously not natural,
obviously a lot less healthy, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that we've given a little
context for folks about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the idea of veganics lives,
let's get right into the heart of the
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while I know you have some
reservations about veganic growing long
[SPEAKER_00]: term, let's set those aside for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about those a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, would you go ahead and make
the case for veganic growing as people see
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do people consider avoiding animal
inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and unfortunately for us,
I think that is an ethical concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of touchy because
everybody has to make their own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions, whether it's their diet or how
they grow their plant or anything else to
[SPEAKER_01]: that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where the incentive for
veganics lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they just don't want to use any
animal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you have to make some concessions
with that choice because microorganisms
[SPEAKER_01]: and protozoa and everything that go in
there that are beneficial are still
[SPEAKER_01]: considered part of veganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the ethical evaluation,
they're saying that they don't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a consciousness or they don't
have a nervous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to me, that's getting a little
tenuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you know, I'm making my own
personal decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have the optimal environment for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants can and will thrive without any
animal inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you look at the evolution of
our planet, you know, plants were first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're walking along your path in
Hawaii, for instance, and you see all
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants just doing lush and all of a
sudden you come across a place where a cow
[SPEAKER_01]: died years ago and it's all of a sudden
ten times as lush right there because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to argue against animal
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of take the ethical avenue of
looking more at mitigating waste and being
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of just throwing everything
away, like let's say all the compost or
[SPEAKER_01]: all the byproduct from your from your
organic dairy production is just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get pushed away or you have all this extra
fish left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually advocate more for using
those animal products, using vermiculture
[SPEAKER_01]: and using those because I believe that
that provides a more optimal environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can completely relate to the
incentive for veganics based on an ethical
[SPEAKER_01]: ethical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of the people that I talk to
who are into veganic growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not necessarily doing it for the
moral ethical reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they do it because they they
think they're getting a healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I must admit, I come to
this topic with a little bit of skepticism
[SPEAKER_00]: myself anyway, because I'm a big believer
in earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so what is the argument that
veganic folks make that that a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: be healthier and more thriving without
using animal products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is the is the idea that the animal
products in the in in those proponents
[SPEAKER_00]: mind somehow is a take from the plant or
make somehow some some sort of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: less available to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I haven't had a good argument with
somebody who is a real strong advocate of
[SPEAKER_01]: veganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I understand is they make the
argument that it's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's a pretty ambiguous statement
to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, you know, any statement that
you're making, especially now in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can do testing for for fungus and
everything else and don't have to stay,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we did in prohibition, kind of under
the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can bring it out and actually test
for these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to see those claims backed up
because I don't really see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the the the roots are going to
take in what they take.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're, you know,
coating the plant with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of well, actually you do if
you're if you're if you're doing foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants assimilate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's you know, that's the whole
probiotic approach is that the the foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding and the in the root feeding,
it's all feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, you know, breaks it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see veganics as being cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I don't see any scientific evidence
to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there could there could be I'm
sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be empirical evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe and I haven't seen a side by
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I tested I tested it myself and was
growing that way for a while just just to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how it worked, because I was I felt a
little responsibility since I was writing
[SPEAKER_01]: for High Times at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to, you know, test these
things to see how viable they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: although I wasn't necessarily advocating
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can also see it like if somebody is
immunocompromised, say, and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be around any animal products
because they don't want to risk having
[SPEAKER_01]: that bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of reasons that people
could make that individual choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see it the quality argument as
being valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I'm starting to get the idea
between the research I did in advance and
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting with you and others that that,
you know, a lot of the people who go to
[SPEAKER_00]: veganics, it may not it may be for for
outside reasons, either moral ethical or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe because they're immune compromised
and they don't want to have animal
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to work with them
themselves with their hands or or or
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm realizing that to a certain
degree, veganics may be kind of like its
[SPEAKER_00]: own response to not wanting to use bottled
nutrients like like it is a obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: veganics is a subset of probiotic growing,
but maybe it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more hardcore version, a hardcore
reaction against salt and synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be, you know, it's kind of
being defined as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I guess the the people who
are doing it and advocating it are
[SPEAKER_01]: defining it as as as they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I did when I wrote the higher organics
article in High Times in 2004,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just kind of putting a definition
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, these definitions can
involved the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the veganics isn't necessarily
probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't work without probiotics,
I would argue, but it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that adds living creatures,
which if you're a pure vegan, and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that they make exceptions for this
because, again, that they're saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: that these microflora do not have nervous
systems and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mentioned I've written an article
advocated about a book by Clay Clay
[SPEAKER_01]: Baxter, which is called Primary
Perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's tested plants, actually,
and found that they do have feelings,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably a kind of an in-depth
topic for another discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he tested them with a lie detector and
and found feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a nutshell, you can read more about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, perhaps there's
communication and feeling happen that that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not aware of even in vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creatures, you know, you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets a little fuzzy when you start
talking about the ethics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, we're late for our first break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has fine
tuned those strategies specifically for
[SPEAKER_00]: large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shore flies,
white fly and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is legendary
probiotic grower and high times writer
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nebu, before the break, we were talking
about veganics as an idea that some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have used and some people have used it as
a bridge towards probiotics as they move
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the bottle and this idea of
veganics that has lasted for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, when I was
researching the show trying to find an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert to bring on, pretty much the only
person that came up anywhere was Kyle
[SPEAKER_00]: Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I dug more and more and I asked my
compatriots there on the Probiotic Farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance group on Facebook about who they
would recommend, your name came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to hunt you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And find out where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is that veganics seems
like this thing that has just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: always been there maybe, but it hasn't
really gotten popular and there aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: very many people evangelizing it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question for you is, did veganics
ever become popular or has it always been
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of minor specialty ideology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's been pretty minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after I wrote about it in 2004,
I don't think anybody that I know of was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Kyle started his company around
it, but that was a decade later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't seen it be a really popular
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a good thing if it stays
true to all the other positive aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk about shipping soil and
things like that, in plastic bags and the
[SPEAKER_01]: trucking and all that, you reach the point
of diminishing returns on the benefit of
[SPEAKER_01]: it pretty quickly as opposed to if you can
do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to admit, the more we talk about
this, I think that my understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: veganics is evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we came to the show, I was kind of
expecting this show to be making a case
[SPEAKER_00]: for veganics that people could either take
or leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm starting to realize is that
veganics is almost like a straw man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, veganics is way better than using
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you might not have the best
thriving plants as if you used some animal
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it sounds like it's almost
like a straw man, a foil to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion around that it might not
actually be a cogent strategy in and of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, but more like an inroad to
probiotics and using nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can see it as being a stepping
stone, as it were, for some folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you introduce all the
creatures, again, it kind of goes against
[SPEAKER_01]: the veganic principles because now you're
dealing with animal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess my concept and my principles
are just I want to provide everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: can, obviously ethically, to nurture the
plant as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems counterproductive to me to
get away from all the creatures that have
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved around it, whether it's
vermiculture, using seabird guano,
[SPEAKER_01]: bat guanos, fish emulsion, all those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just tools that will really,
really provide life for your plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: really help them thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have the ethical concerns or
hangups or whatever you want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: that I need or the immune system that I'm
worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm very probiotic in my own
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't need to worry about any of
those things in my own personal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I can see how people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good thing if they're doing
it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're buying bags and bags of
fertilizer, having them shipped in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all dead, it's in plastic,
then I really don't see any ethical
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it could still be an immune
system concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have to have a real sterile
environment for yourself, that is
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunate because a sterile environment
is the perfect environment for pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even our own bodies, the ratio of bacteria
to human cells, we have more bacteria than
[SPEAKER_01]: human cells in our own bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you need to feed
and nurture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our health is dependent upon that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the plant, the phyllosphere,
the leaf surface is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you populate that with compost teas,
you will not have the diseases like
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew won't be able to start as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a good foliar feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with the rhizosphere,
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding that, you're getting the
symbiotic relationship of breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: all the nutrients and it's just giving the
plant everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm drawing on animal and vegetable,
I will really draw on everything that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like sacrificing animals or doing
anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a waste product, especially
that I'm taking advantage of, then I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: very good about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig into that bit about why the
plants are doing better with animal
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recognize that you're potentially
going to go over my head here since I
[SPEAKER_00]: still consider myself a novice grower
compared to somebody like you who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it for 30 years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
biochemistry behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're not using animal inputs,
what is being missed at the micro level
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is looking for that it can
get from worm castings and using extra
[SPEAKER_00]: fish guts and things like that that you
might throw into your hole?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the plant pulling from these
nutrient-wise that it's not going to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: from pure plant sources?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that goes to the symbiotic
relationship of the nitrogen-fixing
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, all the different bacteria or
the micro-resi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the fungi isn't considered a
creature, but I would have to consider the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and the nematodes and all those
things as creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the bacteria that goes with them,
all the life that goes with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: helps break down a lot of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are already bioavailable,
but it's all about bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those bacteria and all those
creatures add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the goal was to produce... We
were kind of throwing around the term
[SPEAKER_00]: clean product earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one wanted to use animal inputs and yet
they still wanted to try to respect
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a clean product like somebody
who had a veganic mindset was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: attain, what are some of the better animal
inputs that could be used that both have a
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship with the soil,
but also won't sludge up your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say... I would focus on your
community, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're on Vashon Island, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that you've got maybe a
relationship with an organic dairy there
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to start the vermiculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take all the droppings from the
cows and all the manure and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you feed that to your worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's done, it's going to be so
beneficial for your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say you have some relationships
established with fisheries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of them throwing away the fish
heads and the bones or whatever parts they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use, you can emulsify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could use that in your
compost teas as well as your other... It's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the biodynamic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use everything you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's going to be other
considerations, especially now since
[SPEAKER_01]: Fukushima happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be a little bit cautious about
using those fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want a little Geiger counter
there to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad to have to consider that,
but maybe that's another bonus for
[SPEAKER_01]: veganics because as the radioactive
particles become bioaccumulated in the
[SPEAKER_01]: food chain, that's going to be something
that people have to consider more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to bring that up, but there's been
studies and there were three total
[SPEAKER_01]: meltdowns that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're seeing the cesium
signature right on the shores here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see that stopping anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what I like to focus on is
using the waste products, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, it's crazy that there's
these berries harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They throw away the fruit and then they
bring them in hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they burn them at 400 to 500
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody drinks it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's acrylamides in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a toxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who am I to judge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody likes their stimulant and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could take all the coffee grounds
and use that in compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you just have to kind of think
outside the box and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the neat thing, I guess, that I would
like to see is people use their own
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions as opposed to getting some
store-bought thing that's shipped in
[SPEAKER_01]: that's completely dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, that's going to generate some
revenue for the producer and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also getting all that plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the shipping and all the rest
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could be establishing local ties
with your community and using all your
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have to look at it very
closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you could have veganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to stay away from GMO soy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to watch out for cottonseed
that's super contaminated with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to keep your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you decide, you have to
really investigate it thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damned if you do and damned if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_00]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today

[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is legendary
probiotic grower and high times writer
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, I really don't like
how I gave what you had to say negative
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said damned if you do, damned if you
don't after you were talking about making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that your inputs were clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I took the positive thing that
you were saying about building
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I spun it the wrong way
because in the end, you weren't talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about being suspicious about everybody's
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking more about being an
active learner and getting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with your community,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, and I can understand,
I can empathize with your perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot out there that's
pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to get frustrated and just,
it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's poisonous or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's challenging living in our highly
toxic environment of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you evaluate everything,
I still think there's paths that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to look on the positive side of it,
yes, I think that one of the great paths
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can take is developing those
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used your island as an example,
and I think that's a neat community to
[SPEAKER_01]: draw from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really personalize your
approach by using all these philosophies
[SPEAKER_01]: or principles and just applying them to
your own situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really not one right way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of times people want to
just tell me the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many ways and you can
personalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's good for people to always
be learning, always be inspecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally, you will develop those
relationships and mitigate some waste in
[SPEAKER_01]: your community and optimize and build
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it can be a really positive
thing, even though, again, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good time to point
out bioregionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of wild-crafted nutrient
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do this show, I always get
emails from people like, oh, the comfrey
[SPEAKER_00]: that you talked about with your guest,
it doesn't grow wild where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to recommend that's where
I live in Kansas or wherever it may be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of a good point to
make is that if you live here on Vashon
[SPEAKER_00]: Island, you're working with rabbit
pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, man, we've got a tofu factory on
the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get tons of locara.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get lots of locara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas wherever any particular grower
lives, they've got to find out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: inexpensive, healthy, waste products are
around them to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that adds a little exclamation
point to what you were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really is about where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your homework on what kind of probiotic
inputs you can have and find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting into their products so you
know that you're clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get in a relationship with your local
business folk and find out what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you're talking the
soil medium, because that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought it up, because what
you're talking about is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nativist argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can take that to an extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to draw, I'm a citizen
of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a beekeeper too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get a lot of, I've seen a lot of
people talk about this is native,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are really behind honey bees,
even though they're not native to North
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would be kind of lost without them
in our current agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to kind of evaluate these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything's so cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bulk stuff, if you're talking the
soils and things that are just really cost
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitive and silly to have shipped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're doing a 10,000 square
foot grower acres, you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want to be working with what
you've got and amending it with different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I like to draw on the entire world,
because I want to grow the absolute best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure, I'm using soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a lot of local ingredients,
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm getting some fossilized seabird
guano from Peru, boom, I'll use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I'm getting something, some fulvic
mineral from Kentucky, because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: great organic source there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or diatomaceous earth from a mine in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is, neem doesn't grow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a lot of neem, whether it's neem
meal or neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm drawing on all these resources to
produce the most optimum thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that benefits the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fair trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair market type of situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's benefiting people that just
aren't, not just in my local community,
[SPEAKER_01]: but again, those relationships in the
local community too, you can bind it all
[SPEAKER_01]: together and create kind of the best
environment, the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we wrap up, because we're almost
done here, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, before we wrap up not having a
show making a case for veganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was trying to find you through a
few different online forums and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks knew about your high times articles,
but all anybody wanted to talk about were
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains that you had put out as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's all like, have him talk
about his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't you take a couple minutes
and just tell us about some of the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that you put out there and just a little
bit about you as a breeder, because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get emails about like, why didn't you
ask him?
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you just share a little bit
before we wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a whole nother podcast,
but yeah, the, so I was involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: geez, I guess, you know, since 97,
I've been breeding and developing
[SPEAKER_01]: different hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the ones that are out there are
that Jackie O, which is a Jacqueline
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange, and there's Cherry Melon or Cherry
Lime Ricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Black Russian, that was the original
developer of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other people developed it into
F2, but kind of sold it as a F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of hybrids developed
from mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when Overgrow kind of got busted
by the Canadian Mounties, I decided it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be probably best to go underground
again with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never stopped breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on some CBD varieties
now and still working on a lot that
[SPEAKER_01]: express purple and always with a focus on
the sativas, the real functional high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been kind of opposed to the
couch lock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I really need, you know,
the euphoric in the working head space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been my forte.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CBDs are really interesting too
because of the legal aspects of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: also the physiological aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's been pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm working on presently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I'm able to still make some
progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with recreational happening more and
more, I may actually be able to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of the basement and do some
really big time selection with really big
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, because again, all this stuff
that I've developed has been kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: during the prohibitionist era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it difficult, you know,
to be quite frank, because you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers that you could normally draw
on, but I've still made some good
[SPEAKER_01]: progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy that there's folks out there
that remember me or are still enjoying the
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids that I've released over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the cherry lime and the black Russian
got a lot of love when I was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were saying specifically about the
black Russian, about how unique it was and
[SPEAKER_00]: then how they had used it in their own
breeding programs, because it was such a
[SPEAKER_00]: great place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they were like, you know,
speaking of you and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverent tones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice coming across those folks on
my way to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're set for today, Nebu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for taking time to be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you obviously have got so
much more information in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming to talk about this
small area of veganics, and we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: about having you on the show again down
the line about one of the other areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are also an expert in.
