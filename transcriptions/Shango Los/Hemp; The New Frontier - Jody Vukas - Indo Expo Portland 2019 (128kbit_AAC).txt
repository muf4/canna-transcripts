[SPEAKER_05]: Hey there, good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the 10-30 presentation by Jody
Bukas on Hemp the New Frontier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Shango Lowe's host of the Shaping
Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like listening to smart interviews
with the top minds in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: I invite you to check out Shaping Fire at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a killer YouTube channel with
over 150 videos that I record at events
[SPEAKER_05]: just like this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we've got a great video with our
next speaker, Jody Bukas, on designing
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient cultivation operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can check all that out at
shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just search for Shaping Fire on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jody Bukas has been on the forefront of
highly efficient, state-of-the-art
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis growth facilities for the last
nine years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jody has designed, built, and retrofitted
well over a million square feet of some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the biggest licensed producers in the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today you're going to be in a treat as he
presents his new talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today he'll be presenting Hemp the New
Frontier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for Jody Bukas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too generous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, my name is Jody Bukas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart Grow Pros is a company that I
founded about five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: A brief description of what we do as we
were just told.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of design builds of greenhouse
as well as indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some touch points on outdoor,
specifically going into the hemp industry
[SPEAKER_02]: for the last couple of years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our primary focus over the last decade
has been building high efficient grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with companies such as Canobie
Grow Both, Aurora.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some consulting for Tilray.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff in the US, but those are
our biggest clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've worked on multiple continents to
date as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: South America, we're doing some land
development projects, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move forward into Hemp the New
Frontier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know Hemp has been around for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the title of the talk, New Frontier,
is really in regards to the explosion of
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp goes back thousands and thousands of
years, longer than we even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that industrial hemp has been
in the game for a very, very long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is slowly starting to ramp up more
in the US market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, now that we have the farm
bill, that's going to allow us to really
[SPEAKER_02]: push into that both CBD and for fiber
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I've seen in the market the last
couple of years that since we've been in
[SPEAKER_02]: full involved doing consulting and setting
up farms, I myself do have some farm land
[SPEAKER_02]: down in southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out some variations of hemp
irrigation, greenhouses, doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: data capture over the last couple of years
with the plans to scale tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting ready to launch a farm in
southern Texas, about 2,000 acres,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at about another 2,000 or 3,000
acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people looking from the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting into hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of you, if you do come from the
cannabis space, you know that over the
[SPEAKER_02]: last 10 years, 12 years, as we pushed into
a regulatory environment, there was a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of ramping up and learning curves to
understand growing commercially from
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in your closet, your basement,
garage, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we've kind of seen some of that
market stabilize a little bit across the
[SPEAKER_02]: US market, now we're in the second boom of
hemp and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the US market is starting to lead the
CBD markets on the planet, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: although there are some countries that
have been doing CBD for quite some time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we know that some of that has been
being imported into the US market for
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons of lack of availability in the
market and consistency in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pushing it from cannabis into hemp is
a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of variables mixed into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a home run if you're coming
from cannabis commercial cultivation to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it does put some people ahead of the
curve because you have an understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant itself as it's not a standard
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have some special requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition being a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water, which we'll get a little bit more
into later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this crossover can put some people a
little ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself am using what we've learned over
the last decade in a regulatory commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, and we're applying that into
the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fortunately, hemp is going to be a
little less restrictive, although
[SPEAKER_02]: currently, the FDA is meeting to work on
regulations with the USDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some insights of what is going
on in those regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with a couple scientists that have
been asked to be on the advisory board for
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation, which does help us get an
understanding when we actually go and
[SPEAKER_02]: consult with clients to say, hey,
this is how things are moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's actually being written
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things that they're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, touch a little bit more base on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that big pharma is lobbying
heavily and hard against the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw this happen two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there was a major pullback from the
FDA on hemp companies that were putting up
[SPEAKER_02]: products in the market, and they were
labeled improperly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you've interviewed,
been paying attention to what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: in the news or what's going on in the
business industry on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wiped out six or seven of the
largest hemp companies two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that big pharma is against it,
but we know they are waiting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: sidelines, waiting for regulations to be
put in place so they can also step in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've got companies like Amazon,
they released eight products, I believe,
[SPEAKER_02]: about three or four months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBS is coming to the marketplace,
Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tread very lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these companies are very
conservative, like CBS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're stepping into it because they
know that it's going to be a very big
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But without the regulations in place,
everyone's still being very cautious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that has to be paid attention
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's not going to be as tight
of a loophole that we see in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially on the value-added product
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you're going to see a lot of
the strangleholds being put in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting into any new industry,
cannabis was a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving targets, hemp is as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some fundamentals that you need
to be aware of, and you need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: educated before you just say, hey,
let's grab some seeds and let's throw them
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ground or get some starters,
get some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do that, you're going to
find yourself in a world of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research is massive when it comes to
getting involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything from the farm operator,
even if you're just trying to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt for yourself, outside of an operating
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's some advantages to working
with farms, because there's traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: farms that five, six, seven generations
that have been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these people are struggling,
and it's sad to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hemp can also be a big help to turn
some of these farms around and save big ag
[SPEAKER_02]: as we see it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you are able to do some research and
you find yourself a farm or find some dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with, you want to create a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And strategy is at multiple levels to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything from business plan,
compliance, how are you going to
[SPEAKER_02]: distribute?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do it, or are you going
to do genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put a plan in place and be
able to follow that plan and push through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a business just like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of money to be made,
and that's without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of risk as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And research and educating yourself is
going to be the best way to pay attention
[SPEAKER_02]: to risk assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because any time you start a business,
you have to pay attention on both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's profitability, and there's risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always want to try to slide that
scale on the risk assessment side as low
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible, especially if you're using
your own money, or even more so if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: raising money and capital to invest into
your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compliance, I know we're a little kind
of in the gray area with that
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more states are coming online.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Texas just passed their hemp
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it is federally legal,
not all states have gotten on board with
[SPEAKER_02]: what hemp's going to look like for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is one thing you need to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact the agricultural department.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several divisions within state
government as well as local municipalities
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to want to weigh in,
or they're going to have some comments to
[SPEAKER_02]: make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go and ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are very helpful in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been in quite a few states where
it was an open door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were just in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very, very helpful and very open
about what their position was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were willing to help to make sure
that you were going to be set up properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find out what's going on, where you want
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business planning is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of businesses try to start
a business without one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to be next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have an MBA from Harvard
or a genius in the business world to put a
[SPEAKER_02]: business plan together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do some research if you don't know what's
entailed in business plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are going to help steer you in
the right direction from a business
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two sides of the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always recommend, or myself
specifically recommends, if you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation side, don't try to learn the
business side if you don't know much about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get someone involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
the operations can do what it can to its
[SPEAKER_02]: best ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a good financial plane
and a business model, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: in a world of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move on to the better parts of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, most of these crops are grown
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people think you just drop
some seeds in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I get a lot of calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke with a woman the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was told, oh, yeah, we're going to buy
40 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pre-existing farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some structures on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's barns, some silos, no equipment,
no irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't even know if there's water
rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's told, you can just go and get
some genetics and drop them in the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started asking questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question, well, how much capital do
you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have about $200,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, ma'am, what are you
going to do with $200,000?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done any research whatsoever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend told me that it's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just get some seeds, put them in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, do you know what seeds cost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any concept of labor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to take care of the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to feed them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to water them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to be trimmed?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to harvest them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: None.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just because people are telling her,
hey, this is easy, doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all these different components
that are involved in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing we always like to do is we
look at weather studies as one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: first components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to take a look at the last 10,
15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, for example, has possible
hailstorms, especially down south,
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything that's close to the range,
mountain ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can access this information pretty
much online.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are things you want to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature spikes over a 10-year period.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hot is it getting?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the hottest point?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the driest point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity, rain levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And weather is a big component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you're growing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming is an outside agricultural
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hemp is a little different than other
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farm that we're working with,
like I said, fifth generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been growing watermelon,
pumpkins, and cabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they do water applications a little
bit different than we require for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're watering every 12 to 13 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp won't survive that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gentleman ran hemp for the last four
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was not even able to hit a pound
per plant, even planting by May 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reason why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weather and having knowledge of what's
going on is a big part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, soil, water, those two are major
components in growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much water or too little water?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too little water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what started happening is the ground
starts drying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's cracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cracks then expose the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing you know, the plants shut down
or die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, literally, they will dry from the
roots up into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So soil, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two components itself are bigger
than most people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what's in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these farms and a lot of
applications coming from water irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're coming from wells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wells can be very high in iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iron will kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we've seen arsenic as well in well
water to go along with iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are things you need to be aware
of and understand what's in the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those are your two biggest
components outside of weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weather you have no control over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil and the water, you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to take samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to understand what's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can actually build a strategic
nutrition application for your plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: your harvest and your crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've come across a lot of hemp farms that
we've seen general applications of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything from Simplot to CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of just the major manufacturers of
nutrition or fertilizers for other crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: for vegetables, fruits, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say they don't work, but there's no
micro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no calcium supplementation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some certain things or specific
things that are missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, NPK can get you there,
but NPK is not going to increase CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to increase yields,
especially if it's not given in the right
[SPEAKER_02]: doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So general farming, these guys are great
at what they do in those crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, hemp has special requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you could get away with it,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you put a proper program
together, you're going to see better
[SPEAKER_02]: yields, and you're going to see higher CBD
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're seeing outdoor on the top of
the chart is, depending on genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: is anywhere from 14% to 16% on CBD levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, depending on how that gets processed
after, harvest, dried, those conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can drop that CBD level by anywhere
from 4% to 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next thing you know, you're harvesting
at 15%, 14%, by the time you get it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: processor to come and look at it,
or to sell it, you're already down to 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these things matter in how you're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the higher the CBD percentage,
the more valuable the crop is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, what we're seeing is
there's a lot of pillaging going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Colorado doesn't have a lot
of processing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got guys coming from other states
and bonking everybody on the head and
[SPEAKER_02]: beating them down for the biomass,
kind of to the degree of, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll buy for $25 a pound biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you don't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's unfortunate, because people work
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys are putting in very long days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got guys strong arming
because they can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having the highest CBD level content
that you can is also very important,
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of falls back in, starts
falling into the genetic aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between nutrition, with your soil and
water, again, like I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will increase your CBD levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, if you start building
greenhouses, which is something we're
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to do for a different type of
supply chain, you're going to grow year
[SPEAKER_02]: round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see higher CBD levels,
because you're able to control the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment a whole lot more than just
growing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen greenhouse hit numbers as high
as 22%, 23%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the capital venture there is a
bit more costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can harvest five times a year in a
single structure, depending on how you set
[SPEAKER_02]: up your harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics is a big component in this hemp
game, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people claiming feminized
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, what's being sold on
the market is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are breeding or trying to breed
feminized genetics outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently, as we see right now,
we know about seven or eight major
[SPEAKER_02]: lawsuits for hundreds of millions of
dollars, because they were buying genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that were being labeled as feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they kick out after the fact as
part of their defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as truly feminized
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a 4% to 7% chance of males.
[SPEAKER_02]: That study that's actually in the
marketplace that's been published was also
[SPEAKER_02]: attached to a case study that was done of
breeding feminized seeds outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that in itself is problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's companies that have bought and
spent millions of dollars on seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: have spent more money on actual their
farms than getting things set up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then their crops got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've lost millions and millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes back to research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching what you're getting,
especially in the genetic side,
[SPEAKER_02]: is extremely important, because you don't
want to be caught in that situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you get almost to the end,
and you're not even realizing your crops
[SPEAKER_02]: have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing you know, you're looking in
September, and you go, wait a second,
[SPEAKER_02]: why am I seeing seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that you just need to be aware
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some great genetics on the market,
some fantastic genetics, but you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be aware of what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some guys that have been selling
industrial hemp as CBD, and guys have run
[SPEAKER_02]: them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing you know, they're getting 2%,
3% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also lawsuits happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So circling back to the first comment I
was making, research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask, talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are very open about even
what they're doing to a degree of,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, where are you getting your genetics
from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, we get it from HGH seeds,
or we're getting it from blossom seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention, and know what you're
buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, if it sounds too
good to be true, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you right now, the average cost
of a, quote, feminized seed is about a
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see that shift,
because the seed industry is a booming
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity in the hemp market as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's not enough genetics,
and people are scrambling to try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to market, or get them to operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's people that are jumping in
that bandwagon, and they're throwing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of nonsense, and fake things into the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we will see that price on genetics
start to slide down within the next two to
[SPEAKER_02]: three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next three to five years is going to
be interesting to see, because even though
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people getting involved
right now, last year we saw probably about
[SPEAKER_02]: 60% crop failures in what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even here in Oregon, Oregon struggled
because of early rains, and high humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of, you know,
botrytis and busarium, a lot of bud
[SPEAKER_02]: removal that was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get larger yields here in Oregon,
but that becomes a problem if there's too
[SPEAKER_02]: much humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of crop failures here
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting back to the genetic side of
things, there's several options.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's seeds, there's clones,
there's starters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The starters aren't going to always
guarantee you, even if they're called
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized as well, they're not guaranteed
to be feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've suggested is to our clients
that have bought some of these starters,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to have to walk through all
their crops, and eyeball every single
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, to make sure they're not going to
get a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you better know what you're looking
at, because if you skip past one or two,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could wipe out a fair amount of
your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen goes very far, and it doesn't take
much to push it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of breeze will get it where it
needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones, that's another marketplace that
we're seeing pop up a lot last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: or going into this season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones are great, but you need to know
what you're dealing with when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: generational cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are the mothers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do they come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they being taken care of?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of components with
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you have to educate yourself and
know what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to go buy clones,
go to the farm and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the biggest problems that
I've seen with farms offering or nurseries
[SPEAKER_02]: offering clones is the mothers are root
bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you a little thing about
root bound mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will cut production down by 50% to
75%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen this in the Canada space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those mothers are sitting in containers
too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get stressed,
and the offspring are going to give you
[SPEAKER_02]: literally 50% to 75% less of the yield
that they should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen this myself about seven or
eight years ago at my own facility back in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crew wasn't changing the mothers in
Tommy fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to rotate them every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every two, three months, depending on how
many cuttings we're taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran out of harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I walked past the room,
and I looked in, and I go, what are we
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was Dark Star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Star is a large yielder, very large
yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked in the room, and it would
literally look like OG, look like golf
[SPEAKER_02]: ball sized nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we weighed it out, it was almost
70% lower from that harvest to the prior,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the mothers were root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM, pressures are a big deal in outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get into green door, you can control a
bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naturally, indoor is always going to be
your best option.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also know what your pressures are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what other farms are growing around
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what the wind patterns are like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know if it is an outdoor farm,
how are they spraying, and who's spraying,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's all aerial application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the things you need to pay
attention to as well, because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be too close to a farm or
downwind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're coming, and they're spraying
traditional crops, which they can pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much spray whatever they want,
including Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be aware of applications of
fungicides, pesticides, surrounding you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other abortion is the pressures
as far as pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are the wind patterns?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is someone growing grapes upstream from
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because grapes have a large tendency to
produce a lot of powdery melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in a wind pattern,
that's going to be pushed your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to deal with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Integrated pest management is a very big
deal as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bug control, there's a lot of ways that
you can handle that with outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it all circles back to
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding, educating what you're
getting yourself into.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're able to spend some time and do
your due diligence, and honestly,
[SPEAKER_02]: due diligence should take you a couple
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, three months on average is what we've
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get a good idea of where you want to
grow, what you want to grow, how you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow it, the marketplace, genetics,
all these components.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be in a much better spot to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reward is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for the next three, four,
or five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because supply in the US market is not
consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all over the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, Revlon, a colleague of mine,
brokered a deal for 250,000 kilos for one
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase with Revlon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wiped out 60% or 70% of what was
available in the US market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now imagine when you got companies like
the Amazons coming in, and the CVSs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and dog food companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these other companies are wanting to
get into the industry and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: researching value products right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The supply is at the bottom rung compared
to the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of room to get in now,
and set up, and get through the next few
[SPEAKER_02]: years before you see a major push back in
the market, or we'll start to see that
[SPEAKER_02]: price volatility start to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just from what I've seen, and
traveling across the country, and talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to new farms coming online, it seems to be
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, four years is a good time to get
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to be smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do it right and execute,
that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to execute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no fast solution to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do it right, you're going to
look anywhere from $40,000 per acre on the
[SPEAKER_02]: low side up to $120,000, $130,000 as a
gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are real numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my job here is to give you guys some
education on what I've learned,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've seen, and give you enough for
you to stop if you're ready to jump in,
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to ask some questions,
and at least adjust where you're going,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe steer your ship a little bit
different so that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the reason for all these
seminars, is for everyone to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about all I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have some questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were saying the indoor CBD was
getting 22%, 23%, what was the THC
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were still 0.03 or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Total THC or total?
[SPEAKER_02]: Total.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA?
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So test result based on federal mandates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the touch base on that a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'm giving up a little too much,
and my business manager probably would
[SPEAKER_02]: agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'm just Mr. Talkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are ways to monitor your crops and
testing early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that we did on
cannabis about five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe actually about six or seven years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started harvesting or taking cuttings
from plants and getting them tested prior
[SPEAKER_02]: to maturity dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we started discovering was,
and quite a few genetics, CBD profiles and
[SPEAKER_02]: THC cannabis were higher three weeks out
from maturity or harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as they got closer, the THC rose
and the cannabinoids dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing that we've started doing last
season is the same kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: even on outdoor crops and greenhouses as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start taking samples and see what
your profiles look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is a point that they're
going to be at their widest, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to start to close and
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the physiological aspect of the plant
changes as it goes closer to maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were more in relationship
the entire time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize they were apart and then
came together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every genetic's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But greenhouse, you're going to see a
higher level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason being is because it's
consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting the same amount of par
value every day because you can control
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're light-depping in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're removing a lot of the variables you
have no control over by going in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the great thing about greenhouses too
is when it comes to processing,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot faster to get processed because
there's no dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that stuff can be processed a lot
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the degree of a processing facility
that can do 15,000 or 20,000 pounds a day
[SPEAKER_02]: can hit the top end of that market or the
top end number if it's greenhouse product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's outdoor, depending on location,
it might hit 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there comes a point in time
they're going to have to stop,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean, break down, clean, break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some advantages, big
advantages to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why you're going to see the
higher CBN numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what genetics do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of cherry wine is what we like
just because of the dynamic range it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: The HE1 is something else we use a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this day and day and age,
it's really going to be about end game and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you want to offer to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some guys who are pushing more CBN
or CBG genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is part of the research is
where do you want to be in that cog?
[SPEAKER_02]: That cog in the wheel, where do you want
to find your niche?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you educate yourself and have an
understanding of that and seeing what's
[SPEAKER_02]: there and what's missing, you fill those
gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then it gives you a better chance
of being successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Jody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a reference point to hemp and
industrial ag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a commercial greenhouse researcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of my effort is aimed at helping
small to medium size operations in
[SPEAKER_06]: hydroponic food, edible crop production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So could you speak a bit to the potential
of hemp?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that we're aiming toward
the big growers and it's the traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis crop that small and medium size
operations should focus on?
[SPEAKER_02]: So hemp as a whole, and see that it's
going to go across the board to industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD is exploding right now naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're also seeing is a large
increase in just even fiber hemp being
[SPEAKER_02]: grown as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is all very large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on the greenhouse side,
we're working on North Carolina right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing about five acres of greenhouse
for CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other projects that we're talking to
potential clients, that's small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have some clients who are
talking three, 400 acres of glass for
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD is specifically for medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis seems like it's going to be on
the smaller side because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've done some very large
projects in Leamington, Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a 35 acre conversion from bell
peppers and strawberries to all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very unique situation, but we rarely see
large greenhouse applications for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing acres, handfuls, but not 100,
30, 50, not very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that answers your
question at all, but maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you involved with, I've heard of a
couple of the Van Wigert in operations
[SPEAKER_06]: switching over to hemp in North Carolina?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, this is the group in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Carolina is actually based out of
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you could tell me about
what you are spending per square foot on
[SPEAKER_00]: your greenhouses about, you know,
where does that lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, could you speak to the
strains that have CBN as well as CBD hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: for hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as the genetics,
off the top of my head, I actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't have it in front of me,
it's on my laptop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I can give you my contact
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a list that came out of Kentucky
specifically of approved genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, from a federal perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gives some of those ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a fairly long list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's like 50 or 60 at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it does classify, you know,
broad CBD or CBN CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's something I can get some
information to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, greenhouses, that's kind of a moving
target, or I even call it a loaded
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's really about, you know,
what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many variations of
glazing alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything from plastic poly to
polycarbonate to acrylic glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things affect price,
whether you're going to pour a pad or
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just going to do gravel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so it could range anywhere from,
you know, $40, $50 a square foot on the
[SPEAKER_02]: very low end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will probably give you like sheet
metal siding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a very basic greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all the way up to $120 or $130 a
square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and actually get to the higher
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking, you know, full light depth
glass, concrete, you know, doing
[SPEAKER_02]: underground as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, CO2 generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some applications, if it's possible,
that demographic geotherm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of components with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the higher end greenhouses,
you know, are going to give you a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: control, very close to indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the same, but still going to give you
a very close, you know, a close one,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned briefly about Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of the Canada market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you say we have to just stick
with industrial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to hemp, we're talking about
hemp specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada is still kind of trying to find
itself in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some companies that are
dabbling on the hemp side for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was just a, you know,
Kronos just released their, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: did a report on their drop in $300 million
into the hemp industry, but in the U.S.
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with Canada is where it's
located in the hemisphere, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: run a lot of outdoor crops because they
just don't have enough summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Edmonton, for example,
we're doing a large indoor project there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have three months of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of it, it's, you know,
coming out of the cold or going into the
[SPEAKER_02]: cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the hemp, there are some
hemp farms, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging for them because they just
don't have the weather for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they can build greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can do just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it comes down to a play of
capital, how much capital they have to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, circling back to your last
question, you know, industrial hemp versus
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, there's avenues for both,
you know, and they're both very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, the industrial hemp is
exciting just in the fact of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get rid of the plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get rid of all these things that
are killing our planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hemp in itself can, you know,
and I don't know if you've, if anyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: done any research, like Chernobyl right
now, they're working on trying to start
[SPEAKER_02]: remediating the radiation and hemp has
that ability to clean land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's a lot of exciting
things and there's, there's paths in both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's ways to travel down both
and make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, without question, it really boils
down to, you know, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what interests you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you feel passionate
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always, for me, the best route to
take.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm extremely passionate about this and
not that, I'm always going to go down the
[SPEAKER_02]: path that it's something that excites me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, maybe that's a good way for
you to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: To finish off, Jody, I've got a question
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: What form of CBD are you encouraging your
clients to have produced on the end,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: On one side, you've got people producing
CBD isolate, which the genetics may be
[SPEAKER_05]: more available because you're not looking
for the, as large of a terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_05]: but isolate doesn't have the scientific
health support, but people are still
[SPEAKER_05]: buying it and crazy to put it in
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the other side, you've got people
having a finished product that is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a full spectrum or full-ish spectrum
oil with medical applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people generally are like a little
gross CBD, but that end product is really
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you recommend for folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you need to figure out what your
end game is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you like, from my
perspective, ultimately what I want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: is be a supplier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be able to supply medical
grade CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want us to be able to supply CBD that's
available for value add products like
[SPEAKER_02]: lotions and creams and, you know,
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about what do you,
where do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it's still so wide open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: market right now, it's becoming,
you know, a huge thing that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at and throwing hundreds of
millions of dollars at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_02]: 7, 8 years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just really, you got to make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of the clients that we talk
to, they already have in their mind what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, an isolate is generally
what we're seeing 70 to 80% of the market
[SPEAKER_02]: going towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of guys, we just want to do the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to have someone pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they process it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great model.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's simple, you know,
and keeps it easy from a business
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I can't speak for people,
you know, clients generally already have
[SPEAKER_02]: an idea or concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for Jody Lucas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
