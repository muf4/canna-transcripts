[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I can tell you for sure is that
we're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our state governments are allowing some
normalization of cannabis so tax revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: can be raised to feed their bursting
budgets, but it's a little more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, regulation at the state level is
being implemented mostly by folks who have
[SPEAKER_00]: little understanding of cannabis markets,
cannabis culture, and they certainly don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, nearly every state to allow and
tax cannabis has done very little to
[SPEAKER_00]: embrace and include the prior prohibition
era producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think happens when you allow
cannabis culture to flourish and yet
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict participation by the heritage
growers who produce during prohibition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, they just keep on
producing for the unregulated market like
[SPEAKER_00]: they always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could potentially be a huge mess for
the future of true nationwide
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this mean a new drug war 2.0 where
law enforcement officers could bust
[SPEAKER_00]: growers not because cannabis is illegal,
but because they don't have their tax
[SPEAKER_00]: stamp?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Boston Tea Party shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The states give lip service to decreasing
diversion to other states, but when state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators try to dominate a state
cannabis market without including the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market, they are directly causing
the diversion of product to other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who choose not to start
shipping out of state, their family
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business must be dismantled,
even though they were the ones helping
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and keeping the flame alive
during the dark days of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This mess of diversion, neglected
patients, and unstated table markets will
[SPEAKER_00]: be blamed on cannabis companies instead of
where the blame belongs with the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators who devise the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing this wrong, this thing being
called legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are experiencing is
industrialization of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: demise of artisan heritage cannabis
farming in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am not down.

[SPEAKER_00]: My guest this week is Dr. Dominic Korva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominic is executive director of the
Center for the Study of Cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a political geographer and public
policy scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an affiliate researcher for the
Humboldt Institute for Interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Research at Humboldt State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Korva's work has been published in the
International Journal of Drug Policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Political Geography, the Annals of the
Association of American Geographers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ACME, a Journal of Radical Geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: His dissertation research examined the
political economy of international drug
[SPEAKER_00]: policy in the Western Hemisphere and his
post-doctoral research has focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: political economy of cannabis agriculture
in the southern Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be talking about how
the licensed and unlicensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: markets interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Dominic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's been a long time since
last time we talked during the very first
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for making the time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your time is valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm super stoked to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've really done some amazing work on
this podcast since that first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, the history of cannabis in
America is mostly told through its black
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, which is why we're talking about
it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there are certainly new markets
being created all around the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these informal markets have
lasted generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it's unrealistic to
think that black markets will disappear
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because a new licensed and taxable
market suddenly comes into existence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the short answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually want to commend you on your
use of the plural when you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about these things and also how you're
actually using several different concepts,
[SPEAKER_01]: black markets, informal markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of wanted to start by just
reframing things conceptually a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is to say that the black market
singular is a super problematic concept in
[SPEAKER_01]: so many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black markets help us get somewhere by
describing the heterogenous nature of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of illicit, informal
markets that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In another related note, I've been
encountering and I have encountered over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years a certain amount of resistance
to the term black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come from an anti-black market
point of view, but one that is concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about concepts of race and racial justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of folks these days are a
little concerned because they feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a racist term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain that it's not, but I do want to
kind of respect the fact that folks are
[SPEAKER_01]: actively working on the stigma aspect of
things when they talk about the black
[SPEAKER_01]: markets or informal markets or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will also be using the terms a little
interchangeably, black market,
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one for you, legible and
illegible markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that gets it more like what the
meaning of a black market is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that is very difficult to
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: In no small part, obviously, because what
we know about it comes through stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: comes through anecdotes, comes through
things that kind of trickle into our
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousnesses, either in face-to-face
conversations or media headlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a whole range of values
attached to discussions about illicit,
[SPEAKER_01]: illegible, informal black markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of hard to do that work and
still talk about it with any sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: clarity, but it's very important to note
that what we know about illegible markets
[SPEAKER_01]: are stories, and those stories are framed
by interests, and those interests have
[SPEAKER_01]: certain goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, broadly speaking,
legal cannabis has as one of its goals the
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigation of the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that's one of the problems
is that when their story happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very singular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're talking about the black
markets, what are policymakers thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually thinking about organized
crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually not thinking about the
reality of informal markets that are
[SPEAKER_01]: highly decentralized, livelihood
strategies for many people in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that when the legal market is
talking about getting rid of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, let's give them a little bit of
credit because what they're thinking of is
[SPEAKER_01]: not actually the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that we should acknowledge as
well, that organized crime certainly is
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that ecology of illegible markets
that we want to be able to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is also the one that I think
there's a public interest in mitigating
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly strongly, at the very least with
respect to, for example, very large grows
[SPEAKER_01]: on public lands that do environmental
damage and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's an interesting
economic justice concept lurking behind
[SPEAKER_01]: this legal cannabis desire to get rid of
black markets because they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: frame the issue of cannabis, unlike with
the rest of society as one in which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually kind of concerned about the
commercialization of our economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's kind of a,
I think that there's a channeling going
[SPEAKER_01]: on, the frustration with how our economy
works and how we'd like it to work into
[SPEAKER_01]: this debate about getting rid of black
markets and not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with respect to the legal cannabis
policymaker's goal of especially
[SPEAKER_01]: diminishing the structural violence
associated with organized crime and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, and particularly highly commercial
informal markets, I think that the
[SPEAKER_01]: response that has to say, well,
you know what, actually the other informal
[SPEAKER_01]: markets have been doing that work for you
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the problem here is that
you're not enlisting them in your project
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually reduce the harm of highly
commercial, barely different from
[SPEAKER_01]: exploitative capitalism, cannabis
industry, which does exist and also looms
[SPEAKER_01]: very large in legal markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it unrealistic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's unrealistic, especially because
they're using the term black market in a
[SPEAKER_01]: singular fashion and they're referring to
organized crime when in fact medical
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, informal markets that are highly
decentralized, the ones that actually over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 20 years have made US cannabis
consumption a mostly local issue as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to an imported issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been getting rid of organized
crime by overgrowing it in the same way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you overgrow essentially prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting, I think,
framing issue that policymakers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just simply don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get the pluralism of illicit
and informal markets and how many of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually quite socially beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this range is not just to the small
little home grower with a few plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: the backyard, but to me, it also applies
to, for example, in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the unlicensed dispensary system that
certainly they've been encountering,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Southern California,
in the LA area in particular, over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my argument has always been actually
that kind of black market transformation
[SPEAKER_01]: has been quite helpful because it gets
cannabis off the streets and at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: least gets it into a situation where
people are not doing this on the streets
[SPEAKER_01]: and in public and so forth, but there's a
place to go to to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the range of the concern we have about
organized crime and public safety should
[SPEAKER_01]: also recognize the ways in which black
markets have been actually dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, especially because of the
medical cannabis or gray market,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is still kind of an informal market,
but a little more legible, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: action that's been going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: A final note on the black market situation
is that policymakers are attaching a
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma, usually unconsciously,
to organized crime and it usually is about
[SPEAKER_01]: actually brown people, not black people,
because they use this term, cartels,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mexican cartels usually is the stand
in for all organized crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's rare that you hear like a
policymaker talk about the problem of
[SPEAKER_01]: gangs opening dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, again, whether you view that as
a problem or not really depends on whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you understand that, you know what,
this actually gets cannabis off the
[SPEAKER_01]: streets and generally detaches it from
other illicit drugs and drug markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's a really good
point that you make that the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I both know are artisan growers,
are family growers, are small
[SPEAKER_00]: undercapitalized producers who we think
are the backbone of the American heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: grower movement, that because legislators
are not really aware of them and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily spend time with them and their
interaction with those folks are,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, actually, they think that those
folks are all black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think unlicensed people are cartels
and mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they put everybody who's not
licensed in one big basket, similar to how
[SPEAKER_00]: all of we cannabis activists put all of
our legislators in one basket as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: not understanding and trying to limit our
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems like we've got a classic
negotiation where each side doesn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: each other very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are the stakes of one not knowing
the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: The stakes are much higher for
policymakers because they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, entrusted by the public to
actually create policy that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, their lack of understanding
is, you know, what's driving, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's let's look at Oregon, for example,
which already produced way more than it
[SPEAKER_01]: consumes, you know, years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with legal cannabis coming in,
you know, they licensed a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: more, you know, new people and new grows,
new license grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, they instead of,
you know, integrating the existing
[SPEAKER_01]: producers in Oregon, you know,
they they doubled their problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're calling, you know,
they're blaming essentially a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: that had developed a long time ago and is
not new for exacerbating their oversupply
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in fact, the proper thing would have
been to do would have been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, don't issue like new licenses,
take the people who are already especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in the medical programs and and and and
integrate them, which they did it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really did it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was they they said, you know, adults over
the age 21 may now just purchase at
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and we can tax that right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of got off on the right foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, through their
accommodation of, you know, well
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalized interests, who also didn't
understand that they were going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: big problem actually making any money in a
system is incredibly saturated as it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've created a problem that now they
want to respond to with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more policing, which, you know,
has always been more of a price support
[SPEAKER_01]: for the black market than for black
markets in general than a something that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, you know, controls or or
diminishes the informal market activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that the only way to combat
air quotes a black market is either to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it smaller by brute force like,
you know, Duarte is doing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Philippines or by embracing it and
becoming one with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the way that the market
is progressing, you know, neither is
[SPEAKER_00]: really happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war on drugs didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legislators generally get that now and
they're embracing it more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, you already see people
who have already received their license in
[SPEAKER_00]: California snitching on other people who
have not yet gotten their license because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like, now that we have our
monopoly, we want to keep all the
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed sellers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you were saying, them not
necessarily allowing the heritage growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's certainly what happened in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 18 years of medical marijuana that,
yeah, it could use some regular regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and people should have been doing more,
you know, lab testing once they got access
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by taking that entire market and
saying you can't play in licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, our Washington 502 market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're seeing it happen in Oregon
and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is structurally creating a black market
by not letting everyone play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that they're realizing
that they're doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the fact that,
oh, my gosh, the black market is
[SPEAKER_00]: sustaining, even though we're,
air quotes, letting them have their weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they know they're
creating this black market or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are just this ignorant to how
social policy is going to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the economic policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think that they just lack
knowledge whatsoever of the dynamics of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's probably the biggest
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to kind of point out
something else, which is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The licensed cannabis markets is being set
up so that you have to be highly
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial, because if you are not highly
commercial and efficient and able to
[SPEAKER_01]: generate volume at scale, you will not be
able to stay open because you will not be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to pay your taxes, which are all
extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you will not be able to pay your
license fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not be able to bribe your local
city council to not have a ban.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which is how it works,
especially in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what they're doing is actually
taking a critique of informal markets that
[SPEAKER_01]: is founded in, like, basically,
I think, a well-grounded fear of,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what commercial markets do,
which is they don't have any regard
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever for social or public benefits
or positive things for society other than
[SPEAKER_01]: generating money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're creating a system that is just
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just for commercial, highly
industrialized, exploitative, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for-profit, no room to do any good in
society, you know, actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know... And I don't know what to
say about that other than, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you have a fear of, you know,
unbridled capitalism, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your response is to create
unbridled capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's highly
counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, once you're talking about the
license market, now you assume that all
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensed actors are all, you know,
good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stigma attached to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if they've got a whole
bunch of investment money behind them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from the financial sector,
which has been wrecking our economy for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last, you know, who knows how long,
30 years, roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a lot to chew on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the idea that the regulators,
you know, they're essentially driving
[SPEAKER_00]: without a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's scary in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that, you know, by the wave
of their pen, they are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying small family income and no
longer holding a place for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awful lot of power for people who
don't know what the hell is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to, I mean, maybe I'm too
idealistic to think that to the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are making policy would at the very least
get consultants who understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is no one speaking to them and giving them
the truth that they can make policy based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the reality of how cannabis markets
work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two sides to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in a very highly uneven and
localized fashion, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities that are more sensitive to
that than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at, you know, the Bay Area's
equity programs and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: their criminal, the criminal record
expungement part of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at LA's appointment of Kat
Packer to be in charge of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's someone with a civil liberties
and social justice background.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's happening, but it's highly
uneven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to some extent,
it's not just sort of an issue with the
[SPEAKER_01]: policymakers, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislators who are making the laws,
but it's the bureaucrats making the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bureaucrats making the rules are
not that concerned, you know, about the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality of markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much more concerned about the
reality of politics and in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: federal politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's an element to
which you can argue that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Washington system, it really was not
rolled out with any real concern over,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, justice in the markets or
economic justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just wanted to, you know,
get that system going and do it in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that modeled deference to federal
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, like, there's nothing
controversial about that statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite clear, I think, you know,
from the LCB director, from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the folks who are particularly well
associated with how our system has gone,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they're doing is advertising
to the feds that the feds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't come get us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, go get somebody else,
but don't come get us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll take, you know, confusion with
the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take a complete breakdown of the
traceability system that's supposed to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the cornerstone of why it is the
feds aren't supposed to come get us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take that all day long,
you know, as long as the appearance of
[SPEAKER_01]: deference to, you know, the federal
Department of Justice is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's becoming a little
more generalized as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the way it's evolved towards
deference to the feds is a reflection of
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensed industry's desires not to get
cracked down by the feds, not just the
[SPEAKER_01]: policymakers desire not to have public
employees get arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that as the licensed, you know,
the licensed market grows, those people
[SPEAKER_01]: are managing risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they manage risk is,
you know, well, who could come get us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a lot of investment
money, you know, your concern is with the
[SPEAKER_01]: feds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not with local police, it's not with
traceability breakdowns, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are, you know, millions of
dollars in, you know, financial system
[SPEAKER_01]: cash, you know, propping up your
operation, yes, you want to actually crack
[SPEAKER_01]: down on anybody who's not licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just to protect your own competition,
but to, you know, protect your place in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's certainly,
you know, a greedy aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also just sort of a risk
management and financial risk management
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cold-blooded, calculated,
you know, no concern for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects the rest of society,
and particularly people who are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get by because they participate in this
particular informal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what is making the policy is the folks
who are bringing the fresh capital into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis market, and their primary
role is to decrease the risk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, the idea of decreasing the risk
for the capital does not leave a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of room for patients and small artisan
folks and the lack of the need of like
[SPEAKER_00]: huge security systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is Dominic Korva of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for the Study of Cannabis and
Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I certainly still enjoy smoking
joints, I moved over to using vaporizers
[SPEAKER_00]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high was a little different than
burning the flour, and in the end I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided I preferred it for daily use,
especially because I have asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, though, I could taste my
flour so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to express to you how
significantly different cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good terpene profile tastes when vaped
instead of burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have brought my vape with me to visit
growers, and they are astonished by the
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity of taste, and they say they feel
like they're tasting their flour for the
[SPEAKER_00]: very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AirVape Vaporizer from AirVapeUSA.com
is a great device to use on the go or at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pick it up, it feels satisfying
like a medical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't flimsy like many vapes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how the flour is inserted in the
top instead of the bottom, so it travels a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter path to my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the cannabis at the top, I get a hit
that feels more substantial, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just inhaling vapor and not
full-bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I use this vape for flour,
hash, and concentrates, I really like that
[SPEAKER_00]: the digital control for the temperature is
right there on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three clicks of the button and it fires up
to the temperature I specify really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vape concentrates are a milder experience
than dabbing, but you still get the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency in your hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the taste is great, as would be
expected with a low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that this vape gives quick little
vibrations when it gets to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if I'm chatting or distracted
while it's heating up, it lets me know
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ready for a nice pocket-sized
vaporizer, consider the Airvape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new Airvape X has just come out and
it's gorgeous and includes many updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more about the Airvape
vaporizer at airvapeusa.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you own a cannabis company,
you know that finding good business
[SPEAKER_00]: partners, vendors, and allies is an
essential part of your role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building your business in a new
industry like cannabis doesn't always make
[SPEAKER_00]: that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaCon is coming to Boston and Detroit
this summer and the halls will be filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with every kind of ally you need for a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology, horticulture, packaging,
marketing, legal human resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: media, everything you need for your
business will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your customers will be there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because CannaCon is a premier cannabis
business and networking event with
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally recognized speakers and the
opportunity to have serious conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: with your business peers and investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reserving yourself a booth at CannaCon can
unlock a lot of doors for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do you get to network with all
the people who pass your booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not uncommon for CannaCon
vendors to do a million dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: business during the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: CannaCon's Seattle event in February sold
out well in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reserve your booths now for Detroit,
June 1st and 2nd, and Boston, July 27th
[SPEAKER_00]: and 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendee tickets are still available for
both events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you reserve a booth or attend just
for a day, do not miss the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a serious player in your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit CannaCon.org for tickets,
booth reservations and more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CannaCon.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shane Golos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is Dominic Korva,
Executive Director of the Center for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Study of Cannabis and Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, before the break,
we were talking a lot about a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: the misunderstandings that legislators
have about the cannabis market as a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: and why they're acting on this through
regulation is tending to both kind of make
[SPEAKER_00]: a mess of the situation, but more
importantly, sustaining the informal
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely licensed market that they're
trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all understand that many
regulators, even though more of them
[SPEAKER_00]: understand cannabis than there used to be,
so many of the regulators just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that A, cannabis is not an
unhealthy bad thing, but then also B,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know that they want to get their
money from the cannabis because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, wow, we've got new money to make
our budget bigger so that we can take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of our pet programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me, as someone who thinks cannabis is
a positive thing, I'm not really all that
[SPEAKER_00]: into the state adding a SIN tax,
you know, S-I-N, like they do with alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: or using of gasoline where they are,
a tax kind of discourages use or says,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to use this product,
you have to pay extra because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand where the government
gets its right to tax cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that go work historically,
Dominic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are a number of things going
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first, let me say that, you know,
I'm not sure the sort of right to tax
[SPEAKER_01]: frame is, I mean, it definitely gets us
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just roll with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, the government as a
term refers to a whole huge ecology of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, public sector, bureaucracies,
you know, from the federal down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: very local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in each state, there are
different powers to tax that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, permitted or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, in the state of Washington,
we are not allowed to have an income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it very, very important for the
legislature to be able to fund public
[SPEAKER_01]: programs, many of which are absolutely
essential, such as public education.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to find that money somewhere
and they can't tax income.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tax property, and they do sales
taxes, and they have B&O taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are the business taxes and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those business taxes, you know,
also disproportionately punish small
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses, as opposed to large
corporations that can achieve efficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: of scale and manage departments that,
you know, you know, pay people to avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes and, you know, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole thing is already the tax
regime in the state of Washington is set
[SPEAKER_01]: up to really, you know, it's there because
we need the money for public programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which, you know, we may like,
some of which we may not, but we can't tax
[SPEAKER_01]: income, which means that, you know,
this five-year boom in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in King County, Seattle,
around Amazon, is the state has not really
[SPEAKER_01]: benefited from that much at all,
because they have not been able to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: money from income.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have been raising, you know,
property taxes, which raises rents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've been, you know,
increasing their capacity to find and
[SPEAKER_01]: collect fines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so what's happening with the
cannabis industry actually has a parallel
[SPEAKER_01]: in what's going on in the rest of the
state in terms of the relationship between
[SPEAKER_01]: taxation and the public good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's one thing to like, sort of like
put that into perspective and say that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the cannabis industry's best move
would be to lobby for a state income tax
[SPEAKER_01]: to replace sales taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be, I think, one of the
smartest things the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: could do because the state is raking it in
at 35% excise tax, and they don't want a
[SPEAKER_01]: penny less of that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to replace that, you would essentially
have to find a way to replace that
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most obvious place to replace that
revenue would be to tax all these higher
[SPEAKER_01]: incomes that have been created in Seattle
around Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, then there's the level of
taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I actually just stay on
Washington for now, like we can get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other states in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to actually take a moment to praise
Mark Kleiman really weirdly enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: who at the very beginning of this,
one of the things that he did point out
[SPEAKER_01]: was that the state is going to face a
challenge not to get addicted to taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that he did point
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, no money to really deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We remain completely in the hole in public
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spending our infrastructure is decaying,
as in the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do think that collecting taxes on
cannabis isn't necessarily a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the problem is at what rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the justice for that rate's going to
depend on, well, what kinds of business
[SPEAKER_01]: are being taxed?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's small businesses, then really high
honors taxes is going to put them out of
[SPEAKER_01]: business and centralize the actual legal
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, what that is going to
encourage on many fronts is the folks who
[SPEAKER_01]: are barely able to hang in the legal
market because of the taxes are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create new avenues of the black
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So diversion, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That this is not just simply a function of
criminality, it's a function of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity and also what is that business
owner facing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they able to pay the rent on
facilities that have a six month delay in
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing because the city hasn't gotten
to it yet or the LCB hasn't gotten to it
[SPEAKER_01]: yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're almost forced to operate,
the ones who come from the illicit market,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that floats the boat until you
can actually get revenue coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the high taxes, whether or not they're
just or not, they certainly seem
[SPEAKER_01]: counterproductive with respect to
incentivizing diversion in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at every level.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the other end of it, really,
it's because in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_01]: we handed it to the Liquor Control Board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Liquor Control Board took a look at
their own history of emerging from alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition and has attempted to sort of
copy that, even though cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition, alcohol prohibition are not
very much alike and neither are cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and alcohol, broadly speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk about cannabis and wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk about even cannabis and
liquor when it comes to concentrates and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, you have this
tax on cannabis products that actually is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really takes a bite out of the
botanical products at the same level that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes the bite out of these highly
processed edibles, concentrates and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tax regime is kind of just screwed
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a right to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, what's the driving force behind
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the driving force is that in the
beginning of the 21st century,
[SPEAKER_01]: our public budgets are broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're broke because of a 30,
40 year long process that is seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially the privatization of gains in
society way beyond the ability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: states and legitimacy state to actually
collect attacks on the wealth that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by the society that we're
creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a long term bigger problem
here, and that is economic inequality in
[SPEAKER_01]: this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high taxes here and there have
everything to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, well, what do we do
about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we fund public spending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, you have to actually agree on
the idea that public spending is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea versus a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that like I think in this
country, like we've gone to a place where
[SPEAKER_01]: really like because we don't see much
return for what are what little pittance
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually provide for public servants to
actually create infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_01]: create social safety nets and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't spend money on things that
actually help the people who need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a legitimate kind of
revulsion at funding the stuff that we
[SPEAKER_01]: fund, the 280 taxes that are actually a
large source of revenue for the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes straight into a budget,
which is like 56 percent defense and an
[SPEAKER_01]: ever shrinking percentage of actual social
safety nets, spending and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds to me that that actually in
how I asked the question, I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looking at the perspective large
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, maybe a syntax on
cannabis is not really justified or
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate based on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one's looking at it from that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at it as, oh, my God,
we've got this underfunded budget and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we do state budgets is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we just need to pour money
on the beast to buy us through another
[SPEAKER_00]: budgetary cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we're going to have massive
taxes on cannabis because there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really anybody pushing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though you've been
yes, Washington is your examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like this is the same way it's
playing out in every state and is about to
[SPEAKER_00]: play out in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's absolutely,
absolutely the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, that certainly is saddening,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was kind of hoping we'd come out
of this with some kind of of path to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to undo cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds like it's wildly naive of
me because before we can get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tax, even though they just got
it, we would have to both fix how the
[SPEAKER_00]: budget is even made, which is a monumental
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're saying that we would have
to replace the money as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are both a lot bigger than just
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you an example of a
contradiction, which is the founder of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington Cannabis Association,
Martin Tobias, who certainly doesn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: that 37% tax and he certainly doesn't like
the 280E tax is also one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: funders of the folks who keep Washington
State from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having an income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, he gets to have his cake and
eat it too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that like, yeah, there's high
taxes, but it's driving out the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and the bigger businesses can
consolidate and take over the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of those high taxes in the short
term is unpleasant, but really like there
[SPEAKER_01]: is no alternative because he's standing in
the way of there being an income tax,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like him include, again,
every highly capitalized investment fund
[SPEAKER_01]: investing in marijuana, because those
people also work against actually a just
[SPEAKER_01]: and equitable taxation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go with really, you know,
one of the issues in legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: besides people snitching, which is that
the legal cannabis people are not
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in creating a fair or just
economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no interest in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the way that they're
able to both complain about the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, taxes, but at the same time do
absolutely nothing on their part to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, create a society that actually
could, in which we could afford to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: those taxes is to me something worth
keeping in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me that going forward with
everybody looking out for themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're probably going to get more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients are looking out for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislators are looking for their own
re-elections and their ability to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: budget so they're not embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis business owners that are
on of a, you know, a more capitalized
[SPEAKER_00]: size, they're looking to protect their
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got not very much coming
together in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take another short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Dominic Korva of the Center
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Study of Cannabis and Social
Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they are extracted from real
plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind used
during the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you stack those terpenes to make a
blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes also has strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset Sherbet
and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terps before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some alpha-pinene so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
true terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terps you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose true terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is Dominic Korva,
executive director of the Center for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Study of Cannabis and Social Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked about
why the informal market, the unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: market still exists, even in states that
have got a regulated licensed market and
[SPEAKER_00]: why they're probably going to continue to
exist for the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the second set, we focused very
much on the idea of taxation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the damage it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this third set, I'd like to talk about
the kind of market we are creating in the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed market, because the personality
of any market is created both by the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are in it and the regulatory
structures that guide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got real concerns about the
corporatization of cannabis, which
[SPEAKER_00]: historically has been this healing,
patient-centric, even for fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're going to get high and go
out in the forest, you are out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest being high and hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no regulatory structure,
but this new regulatory structure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are coming to the market,
I'm not so confident that the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are creating is all that healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're creating an industrial market,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So corporate and industrial are kind of
two terms that I want to tie together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but industrial largely means that it's
highly centralized, it's attempting to use
[SPEAKER_01]: economies of scale and branding and
marketing to create value for shareholders
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, not necessarily for
low-wage minimum wage workers,
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmers, bud tenders and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all getting paid $12, $15 an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference between that model,
which is corporatist industrial,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we're talking about, we're
talking about what was good about the
[SPEAKER_01]: other kind of black market, which was the
decentralized craft version, which sprung
[SPEAKER_01]: up in many ways is the one that has been
turning back the tide of industrial,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis imports from Mexico by what are
essentially black market capitalists,
[SPEAKER_01]: drug trafficking organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it's unfortunate we've
gotten to the point where the legal market
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to create this industrial corporates
model of what a legal cannabis market is
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their main enemy seems to be craft
producers who really aren't even in direct
[SPEAKER_01]: competition usually with the new legal
cannabis industry, which is heavy on the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles and the concentrates and the vape
pens and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly there's flour, but that
flour is not really, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening at scale, it's hard for the
consumer to purchase it based on anything
[SPEAKER_01]: other than what's on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the cannabis itself that matters,
it's the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're allowing for the continuity
of what to me is an economically
[SPEAKER_01]: destructive model, the corporatist
industrial model, from that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of black market, and we're pitting it
against, as though it could possibly be
[SPEAKER_01]: against craft cannabis, which by the way
isn't suffering from a problem over
[SPEAKER_01]: supply, is not having issues with
pesticides and so forth, and is in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to people who do not have the
financial means to purchase legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because the taxes are too high and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a limited extent to which those
markets are really competing with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, and to me it's more of the legal
cannabis is creating these new cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are aimed towards new
cannabis consumers and older people and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, and that's great, that's one of the
positive things that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's plenty of room for development
on the edible side and the concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: side and the vape pen side for new users,
but for cannabis culture enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_01]: who prefer flower, they don't want to buy
cannabis based on what's in the package,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a direct experience of the
product itself, they want it to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: great, taste great, and even to know the
person who's growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that the way the markets work
right now is that you can't go in and open
[SPEAKER_00]: up a mason jar and get a good whiff of it,
and instead you're buying it based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: copywriting on the package is just absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we all know from using the medicine
that reacts to a terpene profile that your
[SPEAKER_00]: body knows it needs, and so that's what
we're used to going towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, without even going into the
sustainability of adding so much plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: to a one gram, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of that, the black market will
continue to have this power because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can smell the cannabis in advance,
there's a social experience of interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with your neighborhood provider,
and there's more fun too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market can still use copyrighted
names, for example, like all the malarkey
[SPEAKER_00]: going on around the strange Gorilla Glue
and the Gorilla Glue company suing
[SPEAKER_00]: individual retailers for carrying a
product called Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all those crazy names are going to
continue to happen in the informal
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed market, which just increases
the underground's prestige.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean to some extent, what you're
referring to really is a branding
[SPEAKER_01]: development in the unlicensed market that
people are trying to carry over into the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think about black markets,
we usually think about production and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, but actually there's been branding
in the informal markets, and in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: strains are kind of brands now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's helpful to some extent because
there's some vague correlation generally
[SPEAKER_01]: between that brand name and what it
actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not that effective, and I don't
really mourn the issues that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: having with using branding from the black
market on the white market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it actually was one of the
problems with the black market is the
[SPEAKER_01]: extent to which these branding of
cultivars has not really matched the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you look at the Philos
Bioscience work that they've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: it at least shows you the fairly large,
often very large distance between what the
[SPEAKER_01]: brand name is on even the black market and
what the product actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fun to do that, and also those
brand names usually have something to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cross that the cultivar came out
of, so the names that end up happening are
[SPEAKER_01]: not that random and often contain a little
bit of genealogy in them, which helps
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers get educated about what's a
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second, there's been innovation and
we can kind of track it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's also important to
understand too that for especially folks
[SPEAKER_01]: on the East Coast and so forth,
I think that our variation of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market that is craft and you can smell it
and everything and you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice isn't that well reflected on the
East Coast necessarily where stuff goes
[SPEAKER_01]: out in bulk and it may or may not be of
the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't developed the small scale
cultivation system that we have out West
[SPEAKER_01]: as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not necessarily sure where I'm
going with that because I try to emphasize
[SPEAKER_01]: continuity, and I also want to emphasize
heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to celebrate the craft and
creativeness that's allowed when you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have intellectual property lawyers
breathing down your neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to say that that's not
necessarily new either.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there's been a little bit of
inconsistency that now has carried over
[SPEAKER_01]: into the white market probably because of
the leafy periodic table, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: completely absurd.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to circle back around before we
close here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I drifted you off down the branding
path, you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization of cannabis versus
social policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you probably have
something more to say on that because what
[SPEAKER_00]: do you really think is the future of
cannabis based on how the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: structures are presently evolving?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the future of legal cannabis,
I think that there's definitely room for
[SPEAKER_01]: well-made, well-crafted, you know,
cannabis a la the microbrew part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a very large part of the overall
industry, but we are definitely moving
[SPEAKER_01]: towards, you know, a system in which you
have, you know, the cores and the buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of dominating the volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's where we're headed to
with the current situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the craft aspect to it
and the innovative, you know, differences
[SPEAKER_01]: in the terpene profiles and so forth,
the non-standardized, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: product that results from non-standardized
production systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some of it in there,
but like we're definitely, it favors the
[SPEAKER_01]: very large sort of industrial corporate
commercial products that I'm not that
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in for anything else either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'm a no logo guy,
you know, like I'm not into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: standardized, you know, products made by,
you know, sweatshop workers in China,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, that's kind of
where we're headed towards is the
[SPEAKER_01]: sweatshop workers in China model,
which is a return to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the organized crime model really,
which was, you know, didn't benefit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the laborers who worked in the
fields as much as it benefited the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the DTO chiefs and the
government officials, they paid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've decided that the legal model is
going to be the cartel model of
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do feel like that's kind of where
we're headed right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California is a place where this is
getting played out in a way with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have very, very large trade
groups there that are, that have been on
[SPEAKER_01]: this since the beginning, a concern about
commercial, you know, capitalist cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by capitalist actually, I don't mean
necessarily anything other than financial
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalists, you know, because I do
believe that, you know, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of capitalism and
certainly small business capitalism is
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful and worthwhile as opposed to the
kind of capitalism that devours small
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses, which is financial capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me really hope for how
California plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you and I both spend a lot
of time down there, both with the heritage
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and with the transitioning
retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I spend a little time with
legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly spend a lot more time down
there with those folks than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But California being as big of a market as
it is and having so many forthright people
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and having so many, you know,
really top notch cannabis trade
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations in the state, hopefully they
will be able to push back against things
[SPEAKER_00]: like the removal of the one acre cap and,
you know, the local moratoriums and a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of other things that could make or
break California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you in California who are
listening, our hearts and minds are with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really hope that you really do us
all right, because, you know, the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: California goal goes is probably the way
that the rest of the country is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those of us states like us in
Washington who have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: been the first to, you know, normalize if
not legalize, we were more test states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But California is like the big leagues
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can pull it together and push
back against some of these policies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are a mess in the early to regulate
states, I think it'll have a lot of impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I share those sentiments completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're here pulling for you,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, if things are going to change,
it's going to be because of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because of what happens here in
Washington.
