[SPEAKER_00]: Check, check, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, who's life here is better because of
marijuana, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely!
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so who else here knows a patient
or a friend who's getting relief from an
[SPEAKER_00]: ailment because of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is healing humans, and that is
the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, is last spring,
House Bill 5052 passed which dismantled
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana in our state,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have to shop at the recreational
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got friends and family who we love
who are not able to access the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: medical kind of marijuana that they need
at the recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all love to smoke weed,
and they've got that at their recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: stores, but they don't necessarily have
the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get high CBD tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the Shaping Fire podcast,
and I also represent the trade
[SPEAKER_00]: organization Vashon Island Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing for us to remember
here is that just because the legislators
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the law and the regulators have
told us that, hey man, I know that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that your loved ones have got
ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stop providing from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegitimate laws are meant, unjust laws
are meant to be ignored, and that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm suggesting that you do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore the new laws that set patient
limits to only four plants per person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any patient that can survive
on four plants a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means one of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you either have to move
your grow indoors, and not grow under the
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful sun, or you have to grow
outdoors only and only have four plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to take care of yourself
for an entire year on four plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that even if you're just
rolling joints, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: God help me if you have to make your own
RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need pounds to be able to extract it
down and concentrate it to make your RSO,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep your rheumatoid arthritis at bay,
to try to solve your cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do this with four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frustrating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as patients, we're constantly
reaching out to our legislators to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we know, I mean the cat's out of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know now that cannabis is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hurting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't lead to all these bad reefer
madness things we're concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you going to take the plants
back out of the patient's hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore the new rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore the fact that you're only supposed
to allow to have four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we used to be able to have 15,
and many patients needed 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, our state will get in line,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other states allow a realistic
home grow as start, and they will expand
[SPEAKER_00]: from their six plus plants from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington is a good place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the head of the medical cannabis
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should expect that to continue forward,
but we need to give them a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all right, we're going to give them
a little bit of time to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, but that does not mean that
we need to stop growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four plants, keep growing 15 if that's
what you need to provide for yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: your family and your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need 30, do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing here is to realize
that cannabis is a human right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the government own the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the LCB own the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sure as hell is not owned by the
502 stores that are selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are presently a patient,
if you are presently a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you presently have family and loved
ones that are growing for each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to continue to grow,
ignore the law, give the law some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, but until then, just ignore it and
go your own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If enough of us do that, we will be secure
because they cannot bust us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they try to bust one after
another, you know that that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up in the press and the press is
going to say, what the hell is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say we have legalization in our
state, but we do not have legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have corporatization and
commercialization of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have given us just enough liberty,
just enough liberty so that they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: their taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana, cannabis is about healing
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I encourage you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore the new laws, grow your plants,
and hold out until the laws evolve to
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are.
