[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, thank you for being here this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are other things that you
could be doing, so I'm glad that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Dave for the kind introduction,
and thanks also to Eric Norton and his
[SPEAKER_00]: team from Imperious Expo, not only for
creating this opportunity for us all to
[SPEAKER_00]: get together and strengthen our scene,
but also for this opportunity to speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: you this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no doubt that cannabis is an
exceptionally high risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: business for entrepreneurs, and yet we've
all been attracted to this industry like a
[SPEAKER_00]: moth to light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're all here and we're feeling
passionate about it, and we pride
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves on participating in this
industry that is one part patient care,
[SPEAKER_00]: one part booming green rush, and let's
face it, one part taboo and sticking it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the man, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our industry is a tornado, and yet here
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's filled with risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets messier every day, and here we are
feeling passionate about it and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: those risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during my short keynote today,
we're going to consider this dichotomy of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mess and the risk, and also why we
feel so driven to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For newcomers to the industry,
it'll be consideration of the risks and
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of participating in this new
cannabis industry, and perhaps a warning
[SPEAKER_00]: of some new surprises that may come along
when Arizona legalizes adult use in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for others who have been in the
industry a bit longer, it will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some laughs about our shared struggle up
to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, let's start with the risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at what we're really talking
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first and foremost, and what we hear
from people all through the expo this
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend is people are afraid of running
out of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that we hear on and
on in the panels is that people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got raised this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do everything I need to do for
that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of money, and yet the
numbers often don't pencil out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very significant risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've put it all on the line,
and your money is quickly draining away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another risk, though, is that you can have
an otherwise solid business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be an entrepreneur who's practiced
in business and coming from another
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and do everything right,
and yet your state and local taxes can eat
[SPEAKER_00]: up the profit that you have and what
you're used to excluding with your taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the 280 issues eats into your
profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do everything right and still
lose because you're not generating the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but cannabis business
partners make strange bedfellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly common across the country
for people to get together, decide over
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and a bowl that they're going to
start a business together, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything goes awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you're good toking partners,
just because you're neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you like to serve together,
just because you like to hike together
[SPEAKER_00]: does not make for good business partners,
especially when it's very likely that one
[SPEAKER_00]: or neither of the business partners has
any business experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just think they know weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very real risks, and these are
not risks that we generally run into in
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries because in other
industries, there's usually some sort of
journeyman capacity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you've started as a newbie or an
intern, and you become an admin assistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you work your way up,
and then you get some middle management
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, and then you break off and you
start your own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody who was doing that was
Prohibition Era, and most of the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition Era may or may not have much
experience with the sales cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: with HR, handling the finances,
and so what we've got is a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are starting businesses on
passion, personal faith, and quite
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly the money of their neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also be aware of the high risk there
is that a landlord changed their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all experience the pressure,
right, from our friends and family,
[SPEAKER_00]: to some degree, about going into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I've heard
this story from cannabis entrepreneurs who
[SPEAKER_00]: are talking to me, and they said,
you know, I knew that cannabis was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I knew that I had to give it my
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was signing up for seven-day work
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was signing up for seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this is a startup,
but I did not expect the parents of my
[SPEAKER_00]: children's friends to no longer let their
kids come over to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not expect that the pastor at my
church was going to take me aside and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing to the children of our
parish?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not expect that, you know,
the local shopkeeper that I normally work
[SPEAKER_00]: with every day would just like start
making these uncool comments about the
[SPEAKER_00]: business that we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we, as cannabis entrepreneurs,
we experience this regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you come out, which
essentially means the more success you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, the more likely that this is going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that delineates the last risk in
this section, which is divorce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly common for any new
startup to put an insane amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure on a marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if both people in the marriage
are part of the cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe sometimes even more if they are,
it puts pressure on all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our time with our kids go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our time with our spouse can sometimes go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you work with your spouse,
your off time, you're often talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to have the cannabis company not
crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is astonishing as I travel the country
to talk to them in the different rest
[SPEAKER_00]: states to hear people say, yeah,
well, I have a lot more time now to invest
[SPEAKER_00]: in my company because I'm separated from
my significant other.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all very significant risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet all of the risks that I've given
you so far are things that can happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: any startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just turned up to 11 when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let's talk about the cannabis
specific risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common is that you have
put together this fantastic plan for a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana grow and you have got your
strains all figured out and you know where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting your genetics and you are
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's a hitch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changes from state to state,
but it kind of smells like you didn't win
[SPEAKER_00]: the lottery to get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps you didn't get approved for
some crazy reason that they may not even
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you because most of these decisions
are made in a black box of bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, also maybe they have
maybe you're misreading a felony that you
used to have.
Maybe it's for producing cannabis.
And now you're trying to go legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to leave your black market
days behind you and bring your excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: skills to the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, eh, you know,
we know that the laws say that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to look at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're still going to put
somebody else in line in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are risks that affect us every
day and are become a part of our lives
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're choosing in to this high
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another specific risk that comes along
with cannabis is the guy or the gal who
[SPEAKER_00]: had all this money and was going to fund
your program suddenly does not have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the money that was going to fund your
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know, right, we're certainly
not getting bank loans to start our
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means, okay, where's your money
going to come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either somehow you are magically
independently wealthy and you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a big bet on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps you've got some friends that
you, you know, play sports with or your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors or they're at your church or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk to them and they're all like,
they see dollar signs of a magical green
[SPEAKER_00]: rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I don't want to be left
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I missed Google,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to prove the world right
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to show that they smelled the
money when it was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they tell you, I've got this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling this other business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling this painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tell you, you can have all of it
for your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go ahead and you start making all
of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start putting in seven days a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to make promises to your
allies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start reaching out and making new
networking friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All on the idea that you're creating this
inertia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when that check is received and
transferred to you, you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the day comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got everything all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're calling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready to build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready to put the order in for the
parts from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready to sign a lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't get back to you for three
days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that the person that you
were depending on for the linchpin of your
[SPEAKER_00]: business plan has evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really doesn't matter at this point
what their excuse is or what their reason
[SPEAKER_00]: is because it's already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the work that you put in your
seven days a week is flushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is depressing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that we see it all around
us in this scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more companies that are
vaporware than there are actual companies
[SPEAKER_00]: in our industry at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all really hope that we're not
going to be the one but we also happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that it can happen to anybody because
we've seen it happen to good folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even outside of maybe things in your
business plan, all over the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: as cannabis legalization is getting more
real and more tangible, a lot of counties
[SPEAKER_00]: are just freaking out and establishing
moratoriums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suddenly out of nowhere, where you live
is no longer allowing cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies, cannabis retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nine people on your local county board
suddenly makes the change like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not perfectly clear how in the
world a state can legalize marijuana and a
[SPEAKER_00]: county can then say, except here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems wrong to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, Washington, California,
and I'm assuming it's happening here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not, as you move towards
recreational and people start to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between medical and
recreational, they just start to smell a
[SPEAKER_00]: different vibe, I'd say that you can
expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also be expected that neighbors of
Gro's will start doing whatever they can
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of push your buttons and push you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the city, it's challenging
and important to make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust doesn't smell like cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha and beta pining has got to smell to
it that not a lot of people are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they are, they're familiar with it
and they either, well, probably like most
[SPEAKER_00]: of us, are like, who's smoking the day,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for us, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of people, they smell that
and it smells like the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like the criminals and they
don't want that smell anywhere near their
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you live in the city and you're
growing indoors in a warehouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be darn sure that your
scrubbers are intact so that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling up the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similarly, where I live on Bashaw,
on an island, you know, we only have
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculturally zoned property.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers on our island figured we're
good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people have got cows,
people are growing all sorts of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be safe here as far as smells go
because we've got five, 10, 15 acres and
[SPEAKER_00]: that shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you have neighbors who just don't
care for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe morally or maybe they think it has
something to do with their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just start filing a little
grievance with the county board.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn you in, they say, oh,
I smell this awful stink when maybe they
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled it once on a sunny day during your
bloom cycle and it wafted their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not even about the reality
of it, it's about their reaction to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another risk that we have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the last one in this section
is especially appropriate in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a risk that some giant
pharmaceutical firm puts its thumbs on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scale of democracy and plunges a half
million dollars to influence a state
[SPEAKER_00]: election so they can peddle more opiates
and try and corner the market on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: before it gets legalized with the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that cannabis is gonna get
legalized properly in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a shame that corporations can put
that kind of money into what is
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a local election and tip the
scales of justice towards corporate greed
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of thinking about individual
rights and patient needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your first thought was raids,
we don't have them, they're not in my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, and they're unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta tell ya, you need to be prepared
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not take a lot for raids to begin
in your local area because when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, what we are doing is
diametrically opposed to the income of
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's certainly true that there is a
great deal of law enforcement that
[SPEAKER_00]: supports legalization for a variety of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also know, especially in small
towns, there are local sheriffs and others
[SPEAKER_00]: with a chip on their shoulder who see this
as some sort of loss and they are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a way to retaliate and they wanna buy
their new gear and they love coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: your business and capturing all of your
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you have to do in a lot of places
in the country is simply piss somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a local sheriff, a councilman
who has some influence, some mid-level
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucratic jerk who demands some
ridiculous permit that you just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is a tax that you're
putting on me locally which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: justified based on the state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, locally, they make this permit
and so they're essentially extorting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of these people that I'm describing
can give the green light for a raid to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen on your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm not saying it's
necessarily a violent raid, but I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that any time someone comes to your
property in SWAT gear and yelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds like emotional violence to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just be late on your taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of folks are late on your
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are really late on their
business taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it comes to cannabis taxes,
we have to meet a different standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of jurisdictions in California
where if you're late on your taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, you know, three, four business
days, they know that since you can't use
[SPEAKER_00]: banks, you're sitting on cash at your
place of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know now they've got a reason
that'll stand up in court to why they can
[SPEAKER_00]: come to your property, force their way
into your safe, capture your money,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make you fight them to receive it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God help you, if you've got some nice
CO2 extraction equipment, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll take that as well and then you're
down to another six figures for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, if you're an extractor that way,
we'll put you out of business because you
[SPEAKER_00]: might not have another 100K to pick it up,
get it installed, and get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily finishing technology as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the possibility of
ex-employees trash talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you have an employee that worked
out for a little while, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies kind of go through
employees pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they leave with a chip on
their shoulder, and they kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw you onto the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go to that sheriff, that
councilman, that person who gives the
[SPEAKER_00]: permit, and they said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're violating this rule, this rule,
and this rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is often enough to cause a raid on
your property when they should totally
[SPEAKER_00]: just send someone in, a permitting
officer, to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to cannabis,
people jump the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go right from questioning to,
we're bringing in with the guns and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flak jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought about that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they go from zero to 100 so fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because the bureaucracy still
considers us criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are assuming that we've got weapons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are assuming that we are going to
resist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are assuming that they have to be
protecting their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with time, this will go away,
because I don't see a whole lot of violent
[SPEAKER_00]: people in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just normal folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're normal folks who are excited about
something and want to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not how everybody sees us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to be cautious about going into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's probably really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go into cannabis, you should
have a real heart-to-heart talk with your
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time thinking about what your
risk tolerance is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you cannot be brave or
courageous, though, with some amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody in this room who has chosen
to start a cannabis company is exhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: courage, because we are moving in the
direction that history supports,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though a lot of those in power don't
yet recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entrepreneurs in other industries,
they try to equate themselves with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis entrepreneurs are their own
breed, and like no one else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we cannot even use the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an entrepreneur without a bank and
checks and the ability to move cash around
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop cash flow?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet entrepreneurs in other industries
say to us, oh, you know, I could do that
[SPEAKER_00]: if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you love your security too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not risk-tolerant in this way,
and you don't care about the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are fringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are dreamers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are a suit-wearing finance
person with an MBA, if you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you are still an oddball fringe
dreamer to show up in cannabis and dive
[SPEAKER_00]: into all of this risk and find joy in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where you come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you are here means you are
part of this new community.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've covered all the
impressive stuff, that makes a second
[SPEAKER_00]: guess why we're even here today,
let's talk about why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of this talk today is Risky
Business, Why We Choose Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here because we choose to
participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose to be courageous in the face of
messy laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: unsteady enforcement, and the judgment
that we get from our community sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of this risk and potential
headache, what are these rewards that keep
[SPEAKER_00]: us deeply involved and working seven days
a week and potentially risking all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: savings?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this answer is different for
everybody, but there are certainly some
[SPEAKER_00]: common things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, and most important to me,
we are healing humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are self-empowering and choosing to do
the good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chosen to be on the right side of
history and make cannabis happen where we
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We choose to work our asses off in order
to relieve the suffering of our fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in states that are still purely
medical, that is the primary conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to help patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to tell you, by living in and
visiting other rec states, that gets lost
[SPEAKER_00]: awfully fast as soon as the rec market
comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it splits our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are schisms in our scene between
people who are in it because they cared
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plant and they want to heal
humans, and people who smelled money and
[SPEAKER_00]: moved into the new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in tech, and then they were in
real estate, and now they're in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really faulting these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're different than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different than the people who are
into it because we can help heal each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is the best industry
I have ever been in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of those people who did tech,
the dot-com boom, and real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a cannabis enthusiast the entire
time, and I was educating those around me
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to heal themselves with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also wasn't really all that
interested in going to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community that we have created is
fun-loving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our events are way better than any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how great is it to be able to get
together at events like this, get
[SPEAKER_00]: together, compare business strategies,
share best practices, teach each other
[SPEAKER_00]: about extraction technology, talk about
our favorite strains, trade genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go up to the roof of the hotel
and totally get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are fun-loving people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I'm in a suit today
because it's kind of the role I'm playing
[SPEAKER_00]: as panel moderator and delivering the
keynote to you today, we're probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: only industry where we can dress like this
and still be considered professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a damn good time to be in the
cannabis industry, and that holds a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, especially if you've ever done
time in a blue chip company or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cubicle or working for some jerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason is that for many of us,
this is a dream come true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think back to when the first times
you were smoking weed with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a summer afternoon, and you're all
high and laying on the grass and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the sky and joking about, wouldn't it
be great someday to move somewhere warm
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, we'll just grow weed and
we'll have a really good life,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're fantasizing about,
you know, living in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real popular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, since we're here in
Arizona, this is pretty boss, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see people fantasizing about moving
here and growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, is that growing cannabis is
filled with ideals that encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: community, positive relationships within
people, and many people's ideals and
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams of fantasies about what life can
look like fit right in line with growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is growing cannabis and being
in the industry fun and it's been a dream
[SPEAKER_00]: come true for many of us, it's also cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cool to a certain extent is the
judgment of other people because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're cool, but it's different
because I love when I tell people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often their response contains a little
bit of awe, and I know you've had that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when people find out you work in
cannabis, you decide, you see this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in their eyes where they're like,
A, they never really thought that somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who looks like you might be in cannabis or
that they thought you did this other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than anything, you can almost
feel a little bit of jealousy because you
[SPEAKER_00]: are following your passion and you're
choosing to, like we said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stick it to the man a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which leads me to my last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason why it's great to work in
cannabis is simply because it's taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody in this room feels and
identifies a little bit with being a rebel
[SPEAKER_00]: with a cause, a bad boy or a bad girl,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are giving the finger to the man and
maybe their parents and certainly the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole structure of our society who has
told us for years that good people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes we do, and we're going into
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there's all the risks that I
already delineated, and that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: risk, and you really have to have an
insane amount of risk awareness and
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort with risk to even go down this
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do, in addition to it being fun
and enjoying yourself and helping patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and being cooler than your friends,
there's a chance, there's a chance that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge with that though is that we
all know from states that are already into
[SPEAKER_00]: this that the margins are tight and a lot
of it's eaten up by taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there's that promise of being
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen how being a first mover in
industry can equate into large sums of
[SPEAKER_00]: money down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, sometimes it doesn't even
have to be large sums of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can just be making enough to
get by, but doing it in a way that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe tons of money will come down the
line, but maybe that's a long term goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're just glad to be taking part
in righteous living and righteous income
[SPEAKER_00]: and feel that you're living your life with
honor and wanting to help patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: move the ball down the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, cannabis is sketchy and
risky and mean people play dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risks that I delineated are not new to
any of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's as much luck involved as there
is skill to having success in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may need to try several times to
find the right situation or company or
[SPEAKER_00]: business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before hitting the right opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you this, it's the best game
in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many, it's the only game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to help patients and we get to be
cocky lawbreakers at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just might make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dream big, help your neighbor,
make smart moves, and enjoy this building
[SPEAKER_00]: process every damn day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because today is the only day we know we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building a cannabis business is an
honorable pursuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
