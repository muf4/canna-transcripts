[SPEAKER_00]: Pain and chronic illness are so dynamic
that they injure us on multiple levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there is the obvious pain and
suffering that comes with chronic illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those, we use cannabis and other herbs
and medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are the other injuries,
from not being able to work, or perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: play with our kids, or be intimate with
our lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are injurious to our soul,
our zest for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last one, feeling so broken that we
cannot manage to rise up and express
[SPEAKER_00]: sexually with our partners, can be
incredibly soul-crushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it leaves us feeling very lonely
and ashamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know because I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: After both my accidents, I was so broken
that while cannabis helped the pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: my inability to move properly made me feel
like a broken man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're doing this show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I work with cannabis patients
every day and I know of the internalized
[SPEAKER_00]: emotional pain that comes from being
vibrant and energetic inside, with an
[SPEAKER_00]: inability to actually perform on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe this episode can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are solutions for these challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need an open mind, but there are
indeed best practices to be learned so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can have fulfilling intimacy and
sex, even if your human body is suffering.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is world renowned sex
educator, Chris Maxwell Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris has been practicing as an
independent sex educator since 2003 and
[SPEAKER_00]: holds certifications in both professional
massage and somatic sexology, as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in sociology from Vassar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is cohost of the wildly popular
Speaking of Sex podcast, perhaps better
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Pleasure Mechanics at
pleasuremechanics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's show is going to be something
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we will discuss the
mental and emotional challenges of having
[SPEAKER_00]: sex while experiencing chronic pain or
chronic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second set is all about interacting
with your partner and how to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively when either you or your
partner, or perhaps both of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: are suffering from a debilitating ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third set, we will talk very
specifically about sexual positions,
[SPEAKER_00]: toys, and some creative strategies for
sexualizing your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can imagine, today's episode is
probably not one to listen to with your
[SPEAKER_00]: kids in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: While most podcast distributors give our
show an explicit rating due to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are really going to earn that explicit
rating today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for you sharing your
valuable time with us and your lifelong
[SPEAKER_00]: experience on this really important topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many pain patients feel alone in their
suffering because most folks just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: usually talk about sexual difficulty at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start out by getting everybody in
the same boat and feeling less isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find it that it's pretty common
that painful injury or disease inhibits a
[SPEAKER_00]: person expressing their sexuality?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, yes, and yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding the human condition in this
human culture inhibits us from expressing
[SPEAKER_02]: our human sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the thing is we're in a
sex negative and pleasure phobic culture
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin with and a culture that has a
very narrow window of what it tells us is
[SPEAKER_02]: sexually permissible and for who.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when something like illness or
injury, whether it's temporary or chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: strikes us, when our lives change
dramatically and things we have relied on
[SPEAKER_02]: our whole lives, our identities change,
sometimes non-consensually, sometimes very
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically, our sexuality is one of
those things that gets thrown into such
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic upheaval.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we don't have a lot of support for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have an occupational therapist to
help us get back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very many of us don't even have friends we
can talk to honestly about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when change strikes our lives in
any way and we have to allow change in our
[SPEAKER_02]: sexual lives, this can be a moment of such
huge disruption, shame, guilt,
[SPEAKER_02]: fear, shutdown because our options that we
once relied on are no longer available to
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge for all of us, kind of no
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I've been doing this work
my whole life and I will be doing it till
[SPEAKER_02]: I die because sexuality isn't easy for any
of us, for any of us, even some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: coaching clients are quite literally
supermodels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if complications are thrown at us
or changes are thrown at us, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: especially not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But change is also a moment of possible
transformation, of growth, of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can also, I think, as a lot of
us discover when illness or pain comes
[SPEAKER_02]: into our lives, it can have strange
blessings to it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can have strange silver linings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is especially, I think,
true in sexuality because it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to get to know ourselves
again, to get to discover something about
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves and our partner to meet one
another anew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I approach it is with both
holding the full complexity of this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation and also honoring all the
potential that is here with us,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pleasure and the joy and the love and
connection that sexuality is designed to
[SPEAKER_02]: give us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question becomes how to access
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've learned from
working with pain patients is that so
[SPEAKER_00]: often the life decisions they have to make
because now they are injured or they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been given a diagnosis means that not only
do they have the pain and the diagnosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also have to do other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have to move into a less
expensive apartment or maybe they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: move back with their family, for goodness
sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine because not only do you
have this trauma that has happened and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you have this pain experience,
but also at the same time, you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do these important interactions with
your partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not super easy for most people to
talk about their sexuality even at the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be in a place where you're
experiencing so much pain and need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this significant vulnerable and
growing time with your partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh man, this is the worst time
for me to even try to be open with my
[SPEAKER_00]: partner and try to grow emotionally to
where I need to be to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's one perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to offer a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to say going into this
conversation, I want all bodies to feel
[SPEAKER_02]: included in this and we need to honor
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that illness and injury is
such a huge spectrum of how it impacts our
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies, what it gives us to work with,
what it takes away from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things are temporary, but what all of
us have in common just from being humans
[SPEAKER_02]: is change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I really want to come back
to over and over again, because also even
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have a terminal diagnosis,
there's going to be a thousand changes
[SPEAKER_02]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of this becomes dancing with
change and allowing change and changing
[SPEAKER_02]: our attitudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other theme I want to weave
in here is allowing our attitudes about
[SPEAKER_02]: sex to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the attitudes I want to just
bring up right away is you keep mentioning
[SPEAKER_02]: partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first and foremost relationship and
our sexuality is with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not you have one partner,
many partners, no partners for the
[SPEAKER_02]: foreseeable future, you have a sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we talk about sexuality,
I want to talk about our relationships
[SPEAKER_02]: with ourselves, how we feel about our
bodies, what we desire, what we allow for
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves, and how we meet another person
naked in bed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sexuality lives in all of those
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that relationship with
our own body, because having been a pain
[SPEAKER_00]: patient myself, I know that after my car
accident, my body felt foreign to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was acting in ways that I had not
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily I kept a pretty good headspace
about my relationship with my body,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there were certainly times that I was
angry and I felt like my body was letting
[SPEAKER_00]: me down, even though it was doing
everything it could to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since our primary relationship with
sexuality is with ourselves, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice do you have to offer people who
feel that maybe their body has become
[SPEAKER_00]: diseased and is selling them out,
and so it becomes an adversarial
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a sense of betrayal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a sense of grief for what was
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be a sense of anger,
like why me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is especially true if you've been
able-bodied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Athletes or soldiers I've talked to who
have been able-bodied and used their
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies as a tool that could be relied
upon, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And even dialed in their body for optimal
fitness, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all carry different relationships going
into our illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you wake up, many of us,
we wake up in a hospital bed, we emerge
[SPEAKER_02]: into this new condition, we're diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: First you have to really go through all of
that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be real with the anger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be honest with the grief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then try to find the mental space of
asking, okay, what now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What next?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also remembering that will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my own kind of health crisis,
when I woke up in so much pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: there can be such a sense of will it be
this way forever?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that breeds despair, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why would I even try?
[SPEAKER_02]: My sexuality has been taken from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never love again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can have these sense of just
complete betrayal and despair from our
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we need friendly faces or
voices telling us that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still worthy and lovable.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will still find you desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be more or less hard to believe
depending on your circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even again with yourself, a sexuality
is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joy and connection is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you and I know this, but from working
with people in terminal conditions at end
[SPEAKER_02]: of life, after disfiguring accidents,
pleasure, joy, love, all of these things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want out of sex are still
available to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's my voice reminding of you of
this for the first time, or a friend
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting with you at the bedside,
or your partner still looking at you with
[SPEAKER_02]: love, desire, wanting, even if that
wanting has changed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Charlotte and I were together for a
decade before I got sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our wanting used to be feisty and playful
and full of passion and lust and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to tear your clothes off and do
nasty things to you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wanting changed to I want you to be
alive with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to take your next breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that wanting was deeply romantic too,
because we let ourselves feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of this is gonna go back to
feeling, letting yourself feeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: letting yourself feel what you feel in the
moment, being real with it, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to have a sense of agency of what
you want to feel next.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to experience next?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is possible for you given your
condition?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have pain for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you gonna have a sexuality with
pain in the backseat?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's now your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this is about context.
[SPEAKER_02]: We forget sometimes how context dependent
our sexualities are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your context is not now the ground
level bedroom at your parents' house,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a very different erotic context
than your own apartment in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you gonna make it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gonna take curiosity, creativity,
courage, commitment, practice,
[SPEAKER_02]: iteration, mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know it's possible and you
start asking that question, it can be a
[SPEAKER_02]: ray of warmth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warmth and pleasure admits all of the rest
of the horror your life has become for the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can become a thread you follow back
towards a new life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also reminds, we can't ask the
question, when will normal come back?
[SPEAKER_02]: When will I get my old body back?
[SPEAKER_02]: After change, you never go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ideas that you're talking about,
being open to change and to be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the context of your sexuality,
that seems like that would be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: path out of the feelings of depression
that normally come with pain as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this initial shock when suddenly
the pain arrives, or if the pain comes
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, sometimes it hits you when you get
a fin official diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only does the pain itself,
like the, I don't want to perform in this
[SPEAKER_00]: way because it hurts, but then there's
also this depression that comes along with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, where it's like, damn, I'm broken and
I'm never going to be happy and love
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be so heavy independently
that some people are so depressed that
[SPEAKER_00]: they lose will to express their sexuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're depressed and they
don't even have the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my heart goes out to those folks too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like they both share this
pathway out that you're describing of
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially releasing the definitions of
what our society tells us is the pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: strict bandwidth of where sexuality lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to be that small of an
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we keep using the word pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be also nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be mental fog.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things that can come with
illness or injury, lifestyle changes,
[SPEAKER_02]: health changes that impact our sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain is kind of a short word for all of
them because they're all a pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Embracing this change totally,
so much of it is about scripts and
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizing that our sexuality is for a
lot of us, for a lot of our lives,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been very dependent on identity-based
scripts that tell us what we should do,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually as men and as women, what people
want of us, what successful sex looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like, what sex even means, what it is,
what activities it involves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of shocking, especially if
you're not queer, if you haven't already
[SPEAKER_02]: spent a lot of time opening up your
sexuality and your sexual attitudes,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you start looking at it, you realize
what a narrow script most of us are
[SPEAKER_02]: operating in and what it shoulds on us,
the shoulding on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use that kind of intentionally as
almost like a nasty verb because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: how it feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should a man do in bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: What should a woman do in bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: How should a man feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a lot of us, these gendered
scripts tell us a man should be the active
[SPEAKER_02]: initiator, the one that gets on top and
thrusts, the one that initiates with a
[SPEAKER_02]: rock hard penis at any moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: A woman should be desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: She should be able to receive penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: She should be wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out none of these actually
align with our lived experience of
[SPEAKER_02]: sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them align with the human
physiology and mechanics of sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much more available to us
beyond the script.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the liberation that's
possible when all of a sudden our script
[SPEAKER_02]: is burned in the bonfire of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, holy shit, what am I left
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: My dick doesn't work, or it doesn't stay
hard long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pussy doesn't want to be penetrated
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want softer words on realizing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think, I mean, we're already a
character show and we count as explicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're just kind of earning it
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My body doesn't want to be penetrated
anymore, or as often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am tired all the time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these changes that come that throw
our scripts in the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you left with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the kind of deep inner work
that we get to do, not that we have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that we get to do when we have big changes
in life, that reveal so much about
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves that reveal what is left of our
desire when the scripts get tossed out the
[SPEAKER_02]: window.
[SPEAKER_02]: What actually is possible from these two
bodies right now as is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on another podcast, Disability After
Dark, which is another great resource to
[SPEAKER_02]: check out, especially for folks who get
thrown into kind of major life
[SPEAKER_02]: disabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Andrew and I boiled it down to like,
we end up being just two bodies in a room
[SPEAKER_02]: together asking, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I please you?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I serve you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is such a beautiful place to be
with another human being when all the
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit is stripped away, when there's
just this urgency of life and of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is also another gift a disease gives
us is we have an urgency of life again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that place, boundless pleasure is
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Human bodies, and I know this as a
polymorphous queer person, who is fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: and been fucked by all sorts of bodies,
human bodies can fit together in all sorts
[SPEAKER_02]: of ways and pleasure one another in all
sorts of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't need any one specific
capability or ability to engage with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the most beautiful lovers and
kinkiest people I've known have had the
[SPEAKER_02]: most limitations and the most creativity
and willingness to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: With one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really want to like have the
attitude of because I can't perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I bumped my mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what is essential here is
confronting the attitude that tells us all
[SPEAKER_02]: is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never love again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, there's nothing to look forward
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that despair does not help us
heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't help us manage our pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't help us connect.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our current lover or partners we want
to be engaged with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like despair is not useful for very long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a very temporary state to kind
of languish in for a while and feel it
[SPEAKER_02]: fully grieve what has been lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're going to choose to
continue living, the question has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: what next?
[SPEAKER_02]: What now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want to experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then let's let's talk about that
that place at the beginning, because when
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I after my accident, you know,
after I got over the initial awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had been in an accident and I had a
brain injury and I was in a lot of pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and experienced a lot of exhaustion and
you know, there's the first I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: really remember the first three weeks
after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of I disappeared and from from
everybody and I mostly just slept and and
[SPEAKER_00]: when I really came to grips with the
reality of my life, I felt scared and
[SPEAKER_00]: alone and so I called up my partner at the
time and and and I said, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been missing, but I told her I
wanted I'd love to get together with her
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got together and and you know it
touching led to love making and suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: the vertigo was there and and the the like
you were talking about the male role
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier as I was going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional male roles obviously that that
I got really dizzy and I and I and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was above her and and this combination of
feeling dizzy and swooning and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: falling to the side at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized what was happening and what
this meant for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life and I started crying and then I'm
realizing that oh my gosh, I'm injured and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a disappointing guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right it all builds up really fast
right in the moment and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: luckily I am a you know, I'm a I'm a
pretty vulnerable speaker anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so so I was able to speak with her
about what was going on for me and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for that but but for people who
are at that place and their self-worth is
[SPEAKER_00]: so diminished because of whatever this
health challenge is that they're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with you know, it takes a certain amount
of self-worth or moxie to to start down
[SPEAKER_00]: this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about right, you know being
vulnerable and recontextualizing sexuality
[SPEAKER_00]: for oneself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really easy work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what would you say the baby steps
are in in concrete terms for somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that they're here, but they are
emotionally ready to change it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you for sharing that story
because it encapsulates so much so much of
[SPEAKER_02]: our moments when I say, you know,
our scripts have gone in the fire fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that with a certain amount of queer
irreverence, but I also say that knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: that our scripts are deeply comforting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are what have told us that we have
value that we belong that we are wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we think about that moment of,
you know, seeing your lover again and
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation leading to kissing leading to
love making part of what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: connect and you're trying to establish
like we can still do this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question that has to be asked is
like what is the this we are still trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do and what is the new way we are going
to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this starts with talking this starts
with communicating about sex and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say again like this step of changing our
erotic lives can happen with or without
[SPEAKER_02]: illness with or without disease,
but the more loaded your life is the
[SPEAKER_02]: harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the more pieces that you can
control, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing this erotic
transformation under the best of
[SPEAKER_02]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a little bit transforming under
duress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of self-compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to come into play here and
patience and just baby stepping into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of this is like taking stock of
what the situation is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your body capable of right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: How has your body changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that process can take months and again
like changes can happen so quickly in
[SPEAKER_02]: illness that this has to be an ongoing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: In mindfulness we have one of our courses
is mindful sex, which I actually developed
[SPEAKER_02]: while I was sick and healing because the
way I managed my pain and my rapidly
[SPEAKER_02]: changing body was so much with my
mindfulness training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had from 10 years earlier and so much of
that is about paying attention moment to
[SPEAKER_02]: moment without judgment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really easy to say hard to do,
but it's an essential practice when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have to pay attention to our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us have to track our symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That becomes kind of a superpower over
time where we get to know our bodies
[SPEAKER_02]: really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that later, but the
first step of kind of taking stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my body at?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: What capabilities do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I not have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how different does my sex life need to
look?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for some of us the changes will be
subtle, but really profound for others of
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The activities and positions and
interactions we are used to are no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might take some really serious
creativity, bringing in toys you've never
[SPEAKER_02]: even heard of to assist you in having the
experiences you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of this starts with conversation,
either with yourself first, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lying in bed, you're trying to heal
and you're like, all right, body,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have to work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What desires are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your desires might have also
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sex life you used to have might be
even like, not even thinkable to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going out to the club, dancing,
picking up girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that was your sex life before,
it might not even be possible anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you used to make love to your wife four
times a week, that might not even be on
[SPEAKER_02]: your mind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious with you and your process,
like as sexuality got on your mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: was it about will I belong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will I be lovable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will I be dateable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will I be alone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it about like, when's the next time
I'm going to be able to have sex?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to stop thinking about sex as this
package deal and start realizing how much
[SPEAKER_02]: we get out of sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Physical touch, affection.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was about not mattering anymore
because our sexuality and how we present
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves about sex gives people an
impression about what our thoughts are
[SPEAKER_00]: about sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was like, have I made myself no
longer relevant to the saucy, sexy people
[SPEAKER_00]: who I identified with when I was that age?
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, I was going out to clubs and
things more at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since my brain injury, I stopped going out
to clubs entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my feelings of being irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's scary, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody perceives themselves as
going to art openings and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant openings and getting to go all
the cool stuff and then realizing that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of pain and I can barely walk and
I get overstimulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And am I really just going to be at home
sitting here alone forever?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this is about the modeling we
have for sick and disabled people,
[SPEAKER_02]: which frankly sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I also encourage people to start
following and feeding their social media
[SPEAKER_02]: feeds with the disability justice
community who talk and speak about their
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies with respect and reverence and
honor no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful community to learn a lot
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that thing of belonging, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was with Charlotte for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had been sex educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were committed to Eros as a spiritual
path.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got sick and I was like, go on without
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a better lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that self-deprecating, I am worthless
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is our internalized ableism speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is our culture telling us you are no
longer valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are no longer worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are no longer lovable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully the people in your life will
start showing you that, showing you how
[SPEAKER_02]: deeply lovable you are no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, start surrounding yourself
hopefully with people who can reflect that
[SPEAKER_02]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ice just clinked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully surround yourself with people
who can reflect that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, this is a gift we give
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find our worthiness again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is about identity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that we identified with,
our communities that we felt a part of,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we found joy in belonging with may
not be accessible to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is on that community to be
more accessible and inclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also part of it's like our
desires might shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said, your love of music might
transform from going to festivals to
[SPEAKER_02]: listening deeply at home with headphones
on, totally blissed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your desire for nature might change from
surfing to sitting on the shore
[SPEAKER_02]: meditating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how does your body now fit with your
pleasures and your desires?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be the adventure of a
lifetime to figure out as your body
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what we know from people who
are ill, even with terminal cancers,
[SPEAKER_02]: even with persistent pain that would,
you know, the thing pain patients hear all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time is like, oh, I just can't imagine
living that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, if the option is death,
you get used to a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our bodies are so resilient and
adaptive that eroticism and sexuality can
[SPEAKER_02]: be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How will your sexuality adapt?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do your attitudes need to change?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it starts for so many of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get emails every day about the struggles
and people want the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens if we swim upstream to
the attitude that is generating that
[SPEAKER_02]: experience of the struggle that is telling
you that because your penis is in hard sex
[SPEAKER_02]: is impossible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's swim upstream, change that
attitude, show you what sex is possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can choose from the menu of
delights, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing our attitudes, because frankly,
our sexual attitudes are just really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really toxic in this culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all need to do this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we do it through this lens of
change and transformation in order to give
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves the joy of sex back in our
lives, it's really a gift to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want to remind people this
doesn't have to look even like partnered
[SPEAKER_02]: sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you are facing a terminal illness,
your eroticism might look like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: solo time in nature, taking deep joy and
pleasure out of that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be your erotic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's important is that it's yours
and on your terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one more path I want to take
on this idea of our relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: ourself first before we go to our first
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the second set, we'll talk a
lot more about vulnerability and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really important that we
get that relationship with ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: good and grounded first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the extreme, if you go beyond
just the pain and then just the depression
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just the diminished self-worth,
if you continue that, there are people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have gotten to a point that performing
sexually under duress of pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom is so bad that people begin to
form negative associations around sex
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, what you and I have been talking
about, there seems to assume some seed of
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to be sexual again, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that sexuality is part of an
overall healthy human makeup and life
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of insight would you have to
offer with people who have felt like this
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long that sexuality or the
expression of it has become like a
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast for them, a conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though they know that it might be good
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word that really stuck out in your
question was performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: To perform under duress.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds miserable for anyone in any
arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of sex, again, when we're
talking about scripts, you perform a
[SPEAKER_02]: script and we have been taught that sex is
a performance and you do it well or you
[SPEAKER_02]: fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a sex god or you're a total loser,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we are taught that sex is a
performance that you get a grade on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sex is something we experience through our
bodies, through our beings, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can stop performing sex and start being
sexual beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this isn't just like,
you know, cute language for Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really an important attitude shift
where if the question is not, can I
[SPEAKER_02]: perform sex tonight according to a script?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to hit these certain marks in
order to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the question is, what do I want to
experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my body capable of?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's available to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I serve you?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I pleasure you if you have a
partner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have an open ended path to take
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so important to remind people of
this because so much of that not tonight
[SPEAKER_02]: honey or dodging sex or avoiding the
rejection cycle comes out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I initiate sex, we have to do X,
Y and Z and it's a package deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your body isn't feeling like being
penetrated and your husband initiates sex,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so much easier to be like,
nope, not available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then to communicate, well, I'm not really
available for penetration, but X,
[SPEAKER_02]: Y and Z sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see after the foot massage,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with a 10 minute foot massage.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how that makes me feel and know that
there's no pressure to continue either
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to get off after my foot
massage, I will watch you as you stroke
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this level of sexual communication is
almost unthinkable to most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This level of sexual knowing of having
that ease and fluency of talking about sex
[SPEAKER_02]: is unthinkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do we need to start?
[SPEAKER_02]: By talking about sex, by thinking about
sex, by getting new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a vocabulary of what might be
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that intercourse, a few minutes of oral
leading to intercourse script is no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: available to you, what then?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is so much available to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people like me are here to tell you
and root you on and remind you that you
[SPEAKER_02]: are not alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, that's pretty much what
the goal I had with this show is because I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that a lot of folks who are not in
the best relationships with their body and
[SPEAKER_00]: who use cannabis for pain or other relief,
they could probably use hearing this
[SPEAKER_00]: message too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is sex educator, Chris Maxwell
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to Shaping Fire and you grow
your own cannabis, chances are high that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are very particular about the inputs
you use for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like us painstakingly self-educate
on cannabis nutrients and techniques so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can cultivate the best tasting and
cleanest flowers possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we go to purchase those
nutrients, we want to be sure that our
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier shares our values and is
providing exceptional quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend build a soil.com
to my friends who care about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a soil empowers organic growers to
do their best work by sourcing and
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping only the finest cannabis growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: From organic inputs, soils, soil testing
and pots to lights, growing tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayers and cover crops, build a soil
founder, Jeremy Silva doesn't just stock
[SPEAKER_00]: his store with what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes deep to personally vet each
product for quality and determine that
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't a better version of the
product that he could be selling.

[SPEAKER_00]: In times like these, when so many cannabis
companies are growing their flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic warehouses and fields using
synthetic nutrients, it is good to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are authentic California
heritage growers using natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and sunshine to cultivate
cannabis flowers for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has produced the best cannabis
in the world for generations and the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that massively scaled industrial cannabis
production could produce the same quality
[SPEAKER_00]: as small batch lovingly cultivated flowers
is just silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush south fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_00]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals grows under bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is big, beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwood Healing and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_00]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers including Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative and
polyculture cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff Lowenfels on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even my own presentation on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there are over 100 videos

[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to youtube.com forward slash Shango Los
or click on the link in this week's
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is sex educator,
Chris Maxwell-Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we saw in the first set,
common challenges to fulfilling sex for
[SPEAKER_00]: pain patients or really anybody who is
looking for body relief is often a blend
[SPEAKER_00]: of emotional and interpersonal
communication and physical issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is working on a lot of different
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk next about the communication
aspect because these insights likely work
[SPEAKER_00]: for anyone who hesitates from talking
about sex at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to be injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since today, we're really focusing on
cannabis patients with chronic pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: other chronic issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, what sort of advice do you give to
folks who want to initiate conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: with their partner or potential partner to
get them talking about their desires and
[SPEAKER_00]: physical limitations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so often it's just the getting
started part that's so hard you open your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth and you want sound to come out and
it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can people start with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to remember when we're talking
about all communication, one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing is we're making the invisible
visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are bringing our interior life outward
to be shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be scary, but it's also what makes
things possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to give you a little bit of
cheerleading that while opening up your
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth and speaking about sex might be one
of the scariest things you do in this
[SPEAKER_02]: process, it will also be deeply rewarding
if you stick with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because part of communicating about sex is
getting specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about the script.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all get kind of this cultural download
about what sex means, what it means to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a man or a woman, what it means to be
sexy, what it means to be desired.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that information is frankly just
wrong or it comes from a deeply sex
[SPEAKER_02]: negative place that's trying to very limit
your sexual experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we want to do is open up our
minds, open up our vocabularies and start
[SPEAKER_02]: getting ideas, insights and like options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideas are pathways to possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to envision what is possible for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're a man who's just gotten
a prostatectomy and you've lost your penis
[SPEAKER_02]: function or you're in so much lower back
pain, the idea of thrusting is just
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question has become like, well,
then what is possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Communication can start with listening,
reading or watching, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a form of communication where you
are starting kind of in the receptive
[SPEAKER_02]: role.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are great podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is just one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are books you can read.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to put some resources together
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that can be a really gentle way to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're lying in bed, as you're going
for your healing walks, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to a podcast and when there's an
episode that resonates for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share it either with your intimate partner
or even with a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talking about sex with friends can be
less scary maybe than talking about it
[SPEAKER_02]: with your partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to find a zone of safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm talking about safety,
I'm not talking about just physical safety
[SPEAKER_02]: from violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the social safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of brain science we can
go in here, but I'll keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The social safety where you feel connected
and like you belong and you're accepted,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can feel calm and interested in
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the zone you want to try to talk
about sex out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're feeling scared and activated,
and ashamed and fearful, your brain can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really communicate well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's maybe a signal to you if you
feel that in your body, like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is feeling too scary that you want to
take a baby step back and listen to some
[SPEAKER_02]: more podcasts or try something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the resources I'll give to you is
an episode we did about nonverbal
[SPEAKER_02]: communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can write your lover a letter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start a choose your own adventure
book with your lover where you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you rather this or that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can listen to a podcast together,
walking on the street with headphones on
[SPEAKER_02]: and then stop at a bench and discuss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you already have this whole banquet of
language to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can print out an article and highlight
a few sentences and just say to your
[SPEAKER_02]: lover, you know, I saw this article about
this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not saying, I want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you do it to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really charged question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just saying, what do you think about
this idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: But for many of us, talking about sex is
scary because of all the shame,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the guilt, all of the stigma
associated with sex in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're on different places with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's generational issues here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cultural differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also want to get to a place where
you can think and talk about sex on your
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in your own mind, in your own
authentic voice in a way that doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: start with shame, that doesn't start with
fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can take some excavation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've learned, you know, different
people have different cultural backgrounds
[SPEAKER_02]: that tell them that sex itself is dirty or
that pleasure during sex is not the goal
[SPEAKER_02]: or that body should not be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of messages we internalize and
sometimes it's shocking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what we realize, what we have to kick out
of bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we think we're really sexy,
free beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we realize just how constrained
we are by shame or traumas from the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of this is, again, that self
inward step of like, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is going to be scary to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is after an illness,
an injury, a disease, there's so much you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mobility might have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your diet probably has to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cannabis use might change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need conversations with your lover
or your partner or the people you're
[SPEAKER_02]: living with and yourself about all of
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sex is just going to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I find is that a lot of partners
are really relieved when the subject comes
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think when, you know,
your partner is in a hospital bed or has
[SPEAKER_02]: this new injury, sex can feel unimportant
to name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few of the doctors will bring it up,
especially if they don't perceive that
[SPEAKER_02]: children are an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much there, you know,
like the medical industry needs so much
[SPEAKER_02]: training about sexuality, but they might
not even mention it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they might say something, flip it and
like, wait six weeks and then you should
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to resume normal activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always wish like I could pop into
people's bedrooms as the sex fairy and
[SPEAKER_02]: just be like, it's OK, there are options,
but we don't have that magical sex fairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to be bold and courageous
to just like look our partner in the eye
[SPEAKER_02]: and be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to connect?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the stages here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the seasons ahead of us,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are we heading towards a terminal
illness and we're facing a very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: season ahead of us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is is this the acute phase and things are
going to get better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time you don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just about being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a language that really came
out of my illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was being in the current sexual
season that you are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at your partner and being like,
this is where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I need?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we meet each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do our Venn diagrams overlap?
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not be touching at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of this, and I think we'll maybe
touch on this later, but is what is your
[SPEAKER_02]: partner like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the non ill person need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Assuming that just one of you is more
deeply impacted, although that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: always true.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the healthier partner need,
the more able bodied partner need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes their needs get totally
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes all about the sick person and
resentment starts to build and they start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that can lead to other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a conversation about both of
you and about recognizing the season
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in deeply with honesty,
with humility, with all the feels and then
[SPEAKER_02]: starting the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversation about OK, like what do we
need?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need to talk about to move
forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes talking itself is the erotic
relationship for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you can't physically move,
maybe you're going to be in a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: for a few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an opportunity to read erotica
together, to listen to podcasts,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get more honest about what you're both
wanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't always go this smoothly,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm painting a picture of what is
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people are going to find
themselves in all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_02]: contexts and all sorts of different
conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we want to try to center is
the dignity, the idea that sexuality can
[SPEAKER_02]: be a pleasurable part of your life no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might look different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And embrace this idea of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know where we'll be in three or
six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what fun, what pleasure, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What connection can we share right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people will be in the mood to like
have an orgasm the second they wake up in
[SPEAKER_02]: a hospital bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That impulse is there and they are ready
to like reclaim their sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: For other people, it is dormant asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets buried under a ton of other
survival needs and it wakes up slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's so much about seeing where you're
at, honoring it fully and then going from
[SPEAKER_02]: there with support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have set up a couple different
scenarios so that people can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: create this vulnerable environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where whatever that looks like for them
with whoever they're choosing to speak to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, like you though, have this idealized
picture that once folks start talking and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get the ball rolling, that the words
will come freely and the conversation will
[SPEAKER_00]: be animated and there will just be all
this wonderful healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I know that for a lot of
people that is not going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their partner might be in a place where
they are traumatized from the other
[SPEAKER_00]: person's injury or whatever's going on for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have their own sexual hangups
where they're like, I don't want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you share some insights on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the patient and you are trying
to create this vulnerable and sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic so that you can kind of get off
script and create this new context as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're describing, but the partner is a
little resistant because they're just not
[SPEAKER_00]: there with you in their head yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is a disparity that can
come up with or without illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that one person wants to talk
about it and explore and the other is
[SPEAKER_02]: unwilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of this again is excavating
and meeting the other person where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: at and recognizing, you know, I know you
come from a long line of stubborn women
[SPEAKER_02]: who aren't willing to talk about hard
things, but it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, maybe that's not the
best lead up.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best questions I really like is
how can I love you right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is one way I can take care of you,
especially when I was sick and my role is
[SPEAKER_02]: like the giver and the lover and the one
with the magic hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of that was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of my worthlessness, that feeling
of despair is I have nothing left to give.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking so much as a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not producing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving your partner, giving the sick
partner opportunities to show up and love
[SPEAKER_02]: and do something is a gift to both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the healthy partner can say what I
love is to sit and, you know, bitch at you
[SPEAKER_02]: all about my day and have you just listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, are you available to give me
a foot massage?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be really sick, but still
available to touch your lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you willing to sit with me and watch
porn and just be with me while I watch a
[SPEAKER_02]: little porn and masturbate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is that in your vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at what options are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But OK, this comes about like you're
asking about the people who are I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about watching porn together and
you're asking about talking about sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this huge gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I work with this gap every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our audience represents this huge
range of human sexual experience from the
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen and mired in shame and trauma to
the point that you barely want to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: your own eroticism to like, I am ready to
explore the mountaintops of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all somewhere in that process and we
swing wildly within it within our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been at all stages multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're sick, the vulnerability and
just like that holding on to life is so
[SPEAKER_02]: precious and can be so erotic that your
pleasures will make them themselves known
[SPEAKER_02]: to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I say erotic, I don't mean
like this is deeply sexual and sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean erotic as in you are feeling big
feelings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are feeling alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are feeling that pulse of vitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: At my sickest is when I felt that
thrumming through me of like, what am I
[SPEAKER_02]: alive for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What pleasures are still available to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be someone who loves flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go deep into flowers like put flowers by
your bedside every day and marvel at them
[SPEAKER_02]: and let that fuel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your relationship with sexuality doesn't
have to be like the far out sexy sex we
[SPEAKER_02]: think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this whole range of pleasure,
joy, connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're starting this conversation
with your partner and things have changed,
[SPEAKER_02]: so much of the question is like,
how, what are you scared of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be a really good place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you worried about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that will allow the vulnerability
from both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried I'll never be able to make
love to you the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried we won't be able to have
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm worried if we do have children,
we won't be able to parent the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: thought we would, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your worries will come bubbling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be scary, but you're both
holding them anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that too, because you're not
initiating the conversation with let's do
[SPEAKER_00]: new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting with, tell me your story
that you're saying inside to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if the other partner is
potentially going to feel awkward with
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation, starting with them
saying their truth, telling their story,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that that would be one of the
easier places to start when somebody is
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling super hesitant because maybe they
have been traumatized by their partner
[SPEAKER_00]: being traumatized and maybe they're not
too comfortable talking about sex at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my gosh, I have dated women who
the main thing they wanted was to just be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated not meanly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to put someone in a position where
they're being asked to share what matters
[SPEAKER_00]: to them, even just emotionally,
I would say that that may be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: softball entree to get words and emotions
flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that soft, blubbery place where you're
both kind of like torn open a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good place to be if you can get there
safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I want to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you create a context for these
conversations to happen where you both
[SPEAKER_02]: feel regulated?
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel connected?
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like you can say things and mess
up and be forgiven?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we call the culture of your
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so depending on what the culture of
your relationship was kind of before and
[SPEAKER_02]: after whatever this big change was,
you'll have your own strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best strategies is getting in
the car and driving together for that
[SPEAKER_02]: harder conversation because you're not
forced to look at each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not forced into that eye contact
that can become confrontational.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some kind of magic about road
trip talks, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that's about really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it is because you're not looking
at each other or that so often part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: road trip is at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somehow we seem maybe we feel a
little safer by the dashboard lights
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there really is some magic about the
kind of depth that comes when you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car for hours together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And solutions then can start coming up
once you know what the fears are,
[SPEAKER_02]: once you know what the vulnerabilities
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you'll say the thing aloud that
you're so afraid of and your partner will
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, oh, baby, you don't need to worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that relief is just palpable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they'll say, I've been thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waking up at night with these
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can look at each other knowing,
OK, now we're both in this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they'll say, you know, I never even
thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm worried about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's right in front of me,
preventing me from connecting with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can address that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get on a same page so you can
start writing what is next, what is coming
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast number of changes, adaptations,
pivots you're going to have to make in
[SPEAKER_02]: your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just, again, you know,
we're recording this in 2020 in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of a global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're getting a master lesson in
change and resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the human condition is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actually really good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're better at it when we do it
together with people we have established
[SPEAKER_02]: love and connection and affection with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can leverage this.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like relationships will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes illness, injury comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relationships will end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One partner is just not in for the ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has to be valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there can be huge amounts of
abandonment and betrayal and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're if you are in for the ride
together, if you are saying, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to embrace this change and
keep on loving each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a moment where everything gets to
change and both of your needs get to be
[SPEAKER_02]: more fully met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to be in that crazy,
wild adventure of living together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illness can wake you up and create this
urgency if we allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be terrifying and put us in
states of freeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we are awake to our condition,
if we don't feel alone with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we feel resourced, which is very hard
in this particular country with our health
[SPEAKER_02]: care system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, like, what is your stress?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we talk about all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ill, probably the top stressors
on your list has nothing to do with your
[SPEAKER_02]: sex life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's health insurance, it's medications,
it's your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of those things create a context
where you no longer have to feel the place
[SPEAKER_02]: to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: You no longer feel the desire or the
permission to let go and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to look at the whole life
context, what the stressors are,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you're going to relieve your stress
cycles together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your partner might need permission like
you go to your yoga class three times a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call in my other friend for the
assistance I need for bath time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you need care networks also to get
through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that your partner is going to be
your caretaker, help you with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: health insurance paperwork, maybe be a
co-parent and be your lover.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot to ask.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else in your community can help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else in your community can even
provide you with companionship or
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation to lighten the load between
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's more space for this connection,
this play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a lot like this is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say you and I have both been
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now about four years out of my health
crisis and now living with chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has completely transformed how I
approach my work as a sex educator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been aware of the complexity
of sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always approached it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been such a humbling lesson in
how complicated, how nuanced it can be,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also how powerful it can be to give
yourself, even when you're sick,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you're dying, even if you're
riddled with pain, permission to ask the
[SPEAKER_02]: question, what would make me feel good
right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would give me a little bit of
pleasure in my day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe how can I give someone else
pleasure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of us giving someone else
pleasure is a joy for us too, that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: us feel worthy of being alive again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even having a shred of that,
that is like, bring me flowers for my
[SPEAKER_02]: bedside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an act of erotic agency on that
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this term that you used,
the culture of a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's something that is
probably not uncommon that someone gets
[SPEAKER_00]: injured or gets a bad diagnosis in a
relationship and they're already in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really crappy culture of relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vulnerability and the strategies
that we're talking about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of assume a modicum of healthy
culture in the relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's probably worth
addressing the idea that maybe you have
[SPEAKER_00]: got this new pain or disease or whatever
in your life, and you actually don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: that other person around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trauma has made you realize that
they're not gonna be helpful during this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about the first set
when you talked about how the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual relationship is with ourselves,
certainly self-gratification, but even
[SPEAKER_00]: getting yourself flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people should remain free
to know that they can make a decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer be with the partner that they
were before the accident or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean that they are choosing
to fire sex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are probably choosing to express it
themselves for a while and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to develop some skills to attract,
find another partner that they could build
[SPEAKER_00]: a healthier context of relationship with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is certainly enough stress that
comes from a trauma like that that will
[SPEAKER_00]: just go ahead and take a bad relationship
and just crush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think many of us will be nodding
along when we talk about this moment of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see who your friends are after you get
sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see kind of what people can hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't wanna judge people who cannot
hold the intensity or some people will
[SPEAKER_02]: just slip away, but some people in your
life will show up for you in ways you
[SPEAKER_02]: never expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sad thing here is we don't have a
culture that teaches us how to love one
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something I've been raging against
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a culture that shows us how
to show up for our friends in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital, how to love people who are
dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us get totally freaked out and
ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your friendship circle will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your family network will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the people in who are offering help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you said, show people the door who
are making you feel lesser than who are
[SPEAKER_02]: making you feel like a burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will think all of that of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not need people in your life
telling you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their ableism at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their fear of mortality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an uncanny thing how little healthy
people like to be reminded of their
[SPEAKER_02]: mortality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so especially again, if you come out
of a community of athletes, like some of
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends are gonna be really shitty to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people and often it's the people who
have had a sick mother or a sick friend
[SPEAKER_02]: who have gone through an illness
themselves will show compassion for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it in and allow your life to change in
that way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your relationship is not one that can
change with this change in your life,
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes an act of courage to be even
more, I don't wanna use the word alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but without partnership, without that
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bad support is actually a burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bad support just makes everything
worse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're like, oh my gosh,
I wish my helper would go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather be trying this on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there might be a step there of what is
your helper need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're not trained to be caretakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been in both the role of
caretaking someone with a huge major
[SPEAKER_02]: illness and being taken care of to the
point where I couldn't lift my limbs and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were being arranged for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That role is like a sacred, beautiful
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not getting professional
support, you might as a family unit,
[SPEAKER_02]: as an individual need to ask for more help
about how to make these changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our medical system, again, you get sent
home from the hospital with a brochure and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, good luck figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's online communities of
people with my condition, podcasts like
[SPEAKER_02]: this are where you will get the support to
figure out the changes ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask other people with your condition about
their sex life, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on the Facebook group and be the bold
one to be like, so what have you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out about your sex life after
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tips?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be willing to talk about this
and know that you're not alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you're facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether that's sex through pain,
sex through disease, sex at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people who have done this before
and have your back and can be in loving
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with you to figure this shit
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not have to go it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that our American culture is
not super great at at the moment is self
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the first set, we hit on depression
as an obstacle to sexuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any suggestions on getting yourself in the
mood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it sounds like it can be obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be an obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that with the general lack of
self care that we have in our country,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if you add pain or a diagnosis or
something that pushes us off our game,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it may not be immediately obvious to
people to kind of get themselves back in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own mindset even once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of want to be sexual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another one of those moments
for swimming upstream and getting a new
[SPEAKER_02]: framework that will help here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is one of the two forms of
desire, the two forms of sexual interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about spontaneous desire a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just in the mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get horny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a thunderbolt comes out of the
sky and bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not often how people get aroused.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is also responsive desire where
something feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brain tracks it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, that feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of that, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it builds on itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we kind of know that both
spontaneous desire and responsive desire
[SPEAKER_02]: are possible, responsive desire is the one
we have a lot more agency over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start cultivating an attitude of
curiosity about pleasure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of this is a curiosity towards
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is bringing me pleasure today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to follow that thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the mood for what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if it's a package deal of kissing,
oral sex, intercourse, and I'm not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mood for intercourse, I'm just going to
throw out the whole package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm in the mood to cuddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can express that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would feel really good just to lie in
bed, turn all the lights off, get under
[SPEAKER_02]: three duvets, and have you lie behind me
naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give yourself permission to ask
for what you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a huge skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first part of that skill set is
like tuning into your own body.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interoception of feeling your
feelings, feeling how your body is
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling, noticing little sparks of desire,
like, oh, it would feel so good to be held
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then giving yourself permission to
move towards that, to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word depression can mean a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can mean clinical depression that needs
to be treated as its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for a lot of us, it can also mean
context.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the context is so important for
arousal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this brings up another framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we'll link to deeper podcasts
so you can geek out on what interests you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But arousal works kind of like a gas and
brakes model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are often thinking about what would
put more gas on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would give me more interest?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really useful to think about what
is putting the brakes on my desire?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is putting the brakes on my interest
or my willingness?
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are some of the things we can
start actively managing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe my bedroom has become like filled
with medical equipment, and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't feel sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you can do to make your
bedroom have more context?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can the medical equipment live in another
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can you do a hotel room once a month?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about your context?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you change?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there medications that are deeply
impacting things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tweak that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there ways of like parts of the day,
like you have a lot of energy in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: At night, your pain is spiking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you have a conversation about like,
can we have a little bit of time in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning to just roll around in bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's when my body feels best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We each develop our strategies here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on our conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so much of this comes back to
permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you giving yourself permission for
pleasure?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dare you to even start prioritizing
your pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're sick, when we're like,
you know, there's always insurance calls
[SPEAKER_02]: to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always work to catch up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always feel like we're not contributing
enough to the household.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have the mental space to say it's
okay to take 20 minutes and just do
[SPEAKER_02]: something because it feels good?
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of us, like, that's the first
like, is there permission for pleasure in
[SPEAKER_02]: your life anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, how do you give that to yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what's important is noticing the
impact of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because pleasure is some of the best
medicine we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure is what allows us to connect with
others and share deep feelings that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: us feel like part of the human family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure is what motivates us into the
next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pleasure can be an amazing painkiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orgasms can be an incredible painkiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure can get your mind off of your
disease for like 15 precious minutes where
[SPEAKER_02]: you are not your illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that freedom can transform your
experience of being ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I am ill, but I am still also a
mother, a lover, a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am ill, but I'm also still loving
massage and a little kinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am ill, but I also still want orgasms
and oral sex, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're ill, but what else is true
about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let yourself have permission to be an
erotic being on your own terms right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and see what that looks like for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing it doesn't have to be the porn
star model at all to be deeply satisfying
[SPEAKER_02]: and nourishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing, like after a
decade in this field plus, what is
[SPEAKER_02]: satisfying and fulfilling to us as erotic
beings is so vast and variable and
[SPEAKER_02]: changeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that feeling of like, yes,
I am here in my sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a whole person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure is available and accessible to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is available to all of us in one form
or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sense of freedom and erotic wholeness
is what we all long for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how do we get there now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the choose your own adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the dance of all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in an ideal world,
we would end that line of questioning
[SPEAKER_00]: there because, because, oh, you know,
we're essentially giving the message,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that there are solutions for
you, you know, you got to think out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: box and, and you can get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that I want to ask a question
to give voice to a certain group of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have already tried this and they have
been unsuccessful in getting themselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mood and their pain is overarching or
their disease is overarching and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been able to reignite their sexual
vibes because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe they're there for
their partner, for their, for their
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure or not, but for themselves,
they've decided they're done with sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given up on having sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just decided that I'm not even
going to try anymore because I have done
[SPEAKER_00]: all the trying I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have anything heartening for those
folks who are afraid that their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their relationship with their sexuality
and maybe their relationship is doomed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's two pieces here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give up and have that be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have very little interest in
sexuality in general or sexual connection
[SPEAKER_02]: with another person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are asexual their whole
life and that is not a struggle for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a problem if it's not a
problem for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no magic number of kinds of sex or
frequency of sex that makes a sex life
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's healthy if it feels good and right
and fulfilling to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the areas that don't feel
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the areas that still feel like a
struggle?
[SPEAKER_02]: You may say like, I am never, I just
talked to a woman who was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am never having sex again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, I've given up on
sexuality and she went all into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she delights in all of these other
things with human beings and has all this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole other set of pleasures that she
fills her life with and has like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: fulfilling life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So giving up on what are you giving up on
pleasure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that sounds, um, that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even want to problematize that
because I like, there are depths of human
[SPEAKER_02]: experience that I cannot understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I was at my most ill,
um, you know, I had lost a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had lost all of my muscle mass and I was
like, my life was reduced to, I was in bed
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling the sheets against my very frail
body and all my body was, was pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at that moment, I also had a one and a
half year old daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this purpose filled work I loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my pleasure just became about
staying alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure became about hoping for
healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, became about doing research into my
own healing so I could try at least to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, keep my feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, pleasure had totally changed for me
and then it changed again and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: changed again and then it changed again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that trust in change is what I think I
really want to bring to this because you
[SPEAKER_02]: might have just given up on sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might never imagine you're going
to be erotic with anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is what is healthy and feels real
and right to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have other priorities in front
of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have, you know, a diagnosis and
be like, I don't want to spend any time
[SPEAKER_02]: chasing tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make that writing as pleasurable as you
can by the best pen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like luxuriate and whatever we are doing
with these lives of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, that's the urgency I
talk about when we realize, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my disease is one I have to manage every
day and kind of keep myself alive by
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing buttons and double A batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That action every day just reminds me of
this preciousness and whatever spiritual
[SPEAKER_02]: overlay you have, you know, when I light
up a bowl of cannabis and exhale and look
[SPEAKER_02]: out the window and feel alive in my human
body, even if it's pain I'm feeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, there's a gratitude of
just being here for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think like give up on what you like,
give it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, we all have to give up a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a surrender, like give it up and
then be like, what's left?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want to do as I'm drawing this
breath, as I'm exhaling?
[SPEAKER_02]: This smoke is I love the name of your
podcast so much because for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: like cannabis is a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do think about like,
what am I shaping with every breath?
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I shaping in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I creating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Conspiring means like breathing together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you conspiring with towards what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is bringing you delight?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about what sex means to anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your eroticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your threat of life right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris, for going there with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take our last short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're here to learn more about
sexual positions, don't worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the break, we're going to be talking
more about broadening the possibilities of
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual expression in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Physicians, toys, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is sex educator,
Chris Maxwell Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of good seed makers out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, someone becomes
legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mendocino, California cannabis breeder
called Mandelbrot is one of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was also known as Ross Truth
and his cultivars are known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for the Emerald Triangle's
world famous gasoline scented terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day when it was really hard to
find quality genetics in education,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was advocating for organic
growing techniques and providing
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional seeds that would sell out as
soon as they hit the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot lived too short a life,
dying in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while he was with us, he created
several connoisseur level cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: masterpieces like Oil Spill, The Truth,
and Royal Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you approach growing cannabis
more as a toker or a breeder, you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find something that delights you in
Mandelbrot's selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while some strains are better to
grow or to smoke, Mandelbrot's creations
[SPEAKER_00]: excel in every category and that's why
people keep talking about them even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy continues the Ross
Truth tradition by preserving these
[SPEAKER_00]: coveted genetics for future generations
unchanged as they were originally created
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy also creates
tasteful modern crosses to Mandelbrot's
[SPEAKER_00]: classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines worked by Mandelbrot's brother
Ben furthers their family's genetics in a
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit that Mandelbrot himself would
approve of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Emerald Mountain Legacy
Instagram and website to see photos of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and learn more about
Mandelbrot and his infamous strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy seeds are
available online from seed banks and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors, including Labyrinth Seed
Company, The Regenerative Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Pure Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Mountain Legacy, keeping
Mandelbrot's legacy alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to interview you,
implement marketing programs that feed
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottom line, give Blunt Branding a
call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you choose Saint's Joints,
you are smoking all-flour, top-shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry, old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's Joints has focused on their line
of exotic, curated joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saint's Joints goes deeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: searching out hard-to-find strains,
unexpected crosses, and nearly-forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: lambs and races in classics, and some hype
ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does a joint from Saint's smoke
incredibly well, they have fine-tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper, the joint is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: right density to have a nice pull,
and the joint stays lit, even if you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's Joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: out at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's award-winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art,
[SPEAKER_00]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_00]: homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your budtender for Saint's Joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Saint's Joints brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow exceptional cannabis flower
but are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, and risk of launching your own
brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Saint's Joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already established in California,
Washington, and Oklahoma, and recognized
[SPEAKER_00]: by Entrepreneur Magazine and Green
Entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: leader, the Saint's Joints brand will set
you apart in your home market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram at Saint's Joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at their patented drawer design
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Instagram at Saint's Joints
and then visit Saint'sJoints.com to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is sex educator, Chris Maxwell
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, we've gotten to the meat of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what a lot of people came
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how do I still have sex when I
feel like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with limited mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you recommend to people with
limited mobility to figure out the new
[SPEAKER_00]: positions that will work for them
uniquely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so much about finding what works not
only for your body, but how your body fits
[SPEAKER_02]: with the other body for the thing your
bodies want to be doing together,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we think about positions,
it's easy to think about positions for
[SPEAKER_02]: intercourse, but there are also positions
for cuddling.
[SPEAKER_02]: For spanking, for cunnilingus and
fellatio, for all sorts of pleasures,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so much of it is finding that
geometry, the way your bodies fit together
[SPEAKER_02]: now, because how you fit together in the
past is not probably how you fit together
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you can move to do those things,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, our mind might go to thrusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What position will be most comfortable for
my hips to move in a thrusting motion to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that kind of intercourse I used to
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the question, that's like a very
specific set of parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the question is, what are the positions
where my partner and I can have PVI,
[SPEAKER_02]: penis-vagina intercourse, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the goal, that kind of
connection, there's a lot of positions you
[SPEAKER_02]: can be in if you're willing to give up the
thrusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how important is the thrusting to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of this is kind of breaking
it down to the essentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what does my body want to be doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I make that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this is getting out of missionary
style, which I learned by being,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a woman wearing a strap on how
much work it is to be in missionary style,
[SPEAKER_02]: penetrating someone, it's like an athletic
feat, especially if you want to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: big, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if that athletic feat is not
available to you right now or ever again,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to look at all sorts of other
ways of creating penetration and movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of this might be standing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is standing up available for you where you
can position your bed height?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the risers for your bed come in
all sorts of different heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can position your bed so your
partner can either be lying face up,
[SPEAKER_02]: bent over the bed, all sorts of positions,
and that's a good height for your hips to
[SPEAKER_02]: move, for some people standing and moving
is much easier than being up on elbows or
[SPEAKER_02]: their hands, holding their weight and then
moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of props and pillows and
tools that you can bring into your
[SPEAKER_02]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you get over the attitude that
these things are kinky or weird or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just for women or toys are for
all of us, tools are for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different kinds of
toys and tools that can assist you in
[SPEAKER_02]: creating the kinds of experiences you want
to be creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking about something like a sex
sling.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people, they might think,
whoa, that's like a sex swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so kinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think of all the sitcoms where,
you know, the closet door has swung open
[SPEAKER_02]: to reveal the little like dungeon inside
with a swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they are found in sex clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are also an assisted mobility device.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think of it that way and having a
portable swing, you can take out that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can put your partner in and that allows
you to connect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be kinky at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrap some silk around it and make it like
your little love shrine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like put your own aesthetics on these
things and they can become yours if you
[SPEAKER_02]: claim them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is stopping you from getting a
sex pillow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the idea of having sex furniture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now they come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your sex pillow can also be your
reading pillow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your cousin comes over,
it's like, you know, that's my wedge I use
[SPEAKER_02]: for reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't have to be ashamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all like, let me show you how to
use that wedge you use for reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the shame of bringing these
things in can prevent them from being
[SPEAKER_02]: really powerful tools and devices for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to give you permission to
explore toys and tools, assistive devices
[SPEAKER_02]: of all kinds.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you asked about assisted mobility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can mean a lot of things all the way
up to being paraplegic or hemiplegic or
[SPEAKER_02]: semiplegic in a wheelchair where your sex
like it might have to be totally
[SPEAKER_02]: re-envisioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's assessing what's true for
you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking for help.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some great resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sex education educator named L.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wrote a book about sex positions
specifically for fat people and people of
[SPEAKER_02]: size.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that enabled her to really look
at is how do sex positions get adapted?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we move out of bed onto different
pieces of furniture to allow all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: different bodies of all different sizes
and abilities to fit together?
[SPEAKER_02]: So bed is not necessarily the best place
for sex for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can sit in the chair or on a stool
and your partner is able to straddle you
[SPEAKER_02]: and ride you, that might be your new
favorite position because your body gets
[SPEAKER_02]: to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your lower lumbar that needs support has
your extra pillow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel supported and now you get,
you know, your queen on top of you riding
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that requires her to feel
comfortable doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and we can take and there's all
sorts of assistive devices like if your
[SPEAKER_02]: penis isn't getting as hard as you want it
to be, there are toys for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If penetration is harder than it used to
be, there are lubes for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some great cannabis lubes that
are incredible tools for pelvic pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis or recovering pain after
pelvic surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a really great sexual tool to
manage pelvic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a great whole episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I think it's so much again about
what is possible for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if thrusting in bed is not,
is sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's not, is standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's not, like what is, is lying flat
on your back and, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what positions are you able to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how do you adapt that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a book like L.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase's will give you all of these
pictures so you have possibilities and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're more useful than like those Kama
Sutra charts that are made in college dorm
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all like 101 positions for the
athletes and the Cirque du Soleil people.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the positions for real bodies
with real limitations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to point out too
that, you know, certainly it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of difficult to de-eroticize like
toys and dildos and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the supports and pillows and
wedges and some of the other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about, they don't have to
seem medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to go two ways with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, I liked what you said earlier
about claiming a device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of
similarities between a sex swing and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those types of traction I've seen for
injured people to get in and out of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I can see some dual use
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you recontextualize it,
hmm, suddenly like there are new options.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there are a lot of reasons why
some of these, you know, wedges and
[SPEAKER_00]: pillows were developed to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a, oh, we can't have
sex the scripted way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have this second,
slightly lesser than sex using these
[SPEAKER_00]: pillows so that we can manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, experimenting with some
of that stuff, I'm like, oh, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I liked about the scripted
kinds of sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now everything's all way more
convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nicer, this can actually be an upgrade
versus a, oh, I'm sent back to the junior
[SPEAKER_00]: league.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a goal here can be making
your sex life even better than before
[SPEAKER_02]: because you are more awake to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're choosing it more actively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pleasure that is available to you
is not in any proportion to how young or
[SPEAKER_02]: able your body is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want people to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is accessible to you is so much
about your attitudes, what you bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: it, and your internal sense of freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the degree to which we are all
mired under the shame of our sex culture
[SPEAKER_02]: really cannot be emphasized enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a certain momentum to break
through that and then see that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sometimes it's like the storm
clouds open and there's this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility on the other side and there's
this whole community where eroticism is
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrated and safe and revered and just
more as possible for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might actually find new things
that you like along the way because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're being pushed off script,
that means that you are now exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you explore, you often find
unexpected things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, listening to the show that
we have produced, you know, my kinks are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, emotional vulnerability,
telling each other your secrets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and win-win, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that is super sexualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole entire show, these
instructions for two people coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together and sharing their hopes and their
fears and their things they haven't told
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else, that's hot for me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to suggest to other people
that even though that sharing may seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like some emotional work and might seem a
little awkward or might seem scary to you
[SPEAKER_00]: before you do it, you may actually feel
like it's so liberating that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a more fulfilling sex than
you've ever had in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't think of it, you don't have to
think of all of this as medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, I mean, your medical stuff will
have to be managed, and then the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: it is play, toys, curious exploration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word curiosity comes up a lot with us
because some of us can feel really
[SPEAKER_02]: charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the spirit of curiosity allows us to
just take baby steps in and ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: what if?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if I, you know,
tuck my colostomy bag to the side put a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice pillow over it and then let myself
experience oral sex, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find that like that experience
of oral sex is totally available to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your partner is completely used to your
colostomy bag by now, doesn't even notice
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can weep with that relief
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we have a breakthrough moment or
a moment where we do something we're
[SPEAKER_02]: ashamed of and we do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realize what we've been holding
back and we can weep with relief and
[SPEAKER_02]: gratitude at what we have given ourselves
permission to explore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the baby steps are so important here,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you've already been,
you know, tenderized by illness and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other kind of survival issues that
come with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that zone of safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can you establish that zone of
connection where you feel like relaxed,
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to explore with curiosity and just
ease into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that is just reading erotica in the
bathtub or listening to audio erotica like
[SPEAKER_02]: while you're getting your chemo or
listening to audio erotica as you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: your deep rest every afternoon that you
need to get through the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something as simple as that is just like
listening to a naughty story on your
[SPEAKER_02]: headphones and allowing yourself to be
lulled into sleep by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have sweeter dreams and you wake
up the next day like feeling a little
[SPEAKER_02]: nourished by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do these things because they're good
for us, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't seek out sexual pleasures and buy
all these toys and trick out our bedrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're trying to recreate Vegas or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is not like this is because
it is good and nourishing and feeds some
[SPEAKER_02]: part of our humanity that wants to be fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do these things because they're
healthy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Relaxation is healthy for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orgasms are healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are good for our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you make space for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you give it permission?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you give it permission to look
totally new and different and changed and
[SPEAKER_02]: be kind of excited?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, novelty is something we all seek,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the relationship therapists will
say, oh, you're in a long term
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seek novelty, create change, do something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life sometimes gives us more novelty than
we ever wanted to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that change comes as at once,
but we can face it and just be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying your first vibrator is a huge
experience for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you have one, you tend to have
four or five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you realize these are just tools
that allow you to stimulate your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe some of your sex toys are like
massage toys, things that help you manage
[SPEAKER_02]: your pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so many body toys around this
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all sorts of massage balls and
back things and things that help us with
our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our bodies manage our symptoms,
our allies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though we're medicinal,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my marijuana is medicinal,
but it's also deeply pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sacrament.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way I socialize with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a really rich conversation is
good medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also worthwhile, since we're
all stoners here, to time your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that if you're going to have
cannabis be part of your sex play,
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it ahead of time so that
you're not overly checked out or that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've had enough so that your pain is
treated properly at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that it's important to
remember that we become less inhibited
[SPEAKER_00]: when we use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is good and can be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if that inhibition goes a little
further than maybe we want, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually re-injure ourselves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all, I think, gotten into the swing
of things and found ourselves holding up
[SPEAKER_00]: our bodies in ways that are not good for
the injury or just for the body in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in the zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to change it in that
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using enough cannabis where we move
through the, where we go too far,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going the wrong direction,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of your cannabis use so
that you're using the right amount in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right modality, whether it's smoking your
tinctures or whatever, and get yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: timed right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're feeling awkward
about this, don't take more of it so you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel better, but you take more of it and
then you start having a good time and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you go too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wise words, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dial it in with your strains,
with your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's just another tool that you can
use to be with your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say two things really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is adjusting for comfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get in the zone, when we feel
like, oh, sex is going good finally at
[SPEAKER_02]: last, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made something happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to override discomfort or
emotional or physical discomfort in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no martyrs in pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep it pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need to make adjustments,
make adjustments and know that what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: building doesn't have to be fragile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's the culture of pleasure
you create in your relationship where you
[SPEAKER_02]: both have permission to change and adjust
and make requests and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: my feet are cold, grab a blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, oh my God, I have to get off my ankles
or my hips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just gave out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not like, oh, you poor,
weak, pathetic thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, oh my gosh, let's find a position
that works now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to keep this pleasurable thing
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's make it more pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could make this even better is one of
my favorite questions to ask all the time
[SPEAKER_02]: is what could make this even better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it acknowledges we have a good,
beautiful, mutual, pleasurable thing
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: What could make this even better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's optimize our time together,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sex and play and touch, these are all
beautiful times we get to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we take the performance out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we take the pressure out of it and
restore it to play and connection?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be hard with medical devices
flying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wear an insulin pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have this device dangling from my
body 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: An alarm will go off in the middle of sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotten ripped out and blood started
spurting on the sheets in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: sex, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we just move with these moments or
manage them as best as we can and also
[SPEAKER_02]: just have like the flexibility,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like most diseases are not static.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your symptoms change day to day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be able to have that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are you up for now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, knowing a five minute foot
massage can lead to a blissful hour of sex
[SPEAKER_02]: if things get flowing and you're both
feeling good and you lead like one
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasure to the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it's just five minutes of foot
massage and after that five minutes you
[SPEAKER_02]: towel off your hands and you smile at each
other and you just feel a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: connected and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a win.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is like a good thing that just
happened and you can build on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk a lot about micro pleasures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for yourself and then how do you share
micro pleasures and build on them
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: On a, on a recent episode also about pain
and moving from opioids to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we talk about not comparing your
experience to others because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, your dosage may be that you
need only 2.5 milligrams of whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas somebody else may be looking at 25
or 50 milligrams and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis scene there's a,
there's a little bit of ego coolness
[SPEAKER_00]: factor about, oh, that's all you take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think that's so absurd,
you know, you know, individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is a modern thing and calls for
everybody to take the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets them the relief that they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter what your neighbor
is taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, what I would love you to speak
to is the idea that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the various, uh, sex toys you've been
talking about and that are available are
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow gender related, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are boys toys, these are girls
toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've heard you talk about this
before, but I'd like you to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, address that idea of the
universality of these and use what the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, more and more of the industry is just
releasing incredible toys that are high
[SPEAKER_02]: tech vibrators and high quality materials
that can be used to stimulate all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: body parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to really get over this idea that
vibrators are for the girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, vibrators can be incredible tools,
um, for higher stimulation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If your erectile function has changed,
um, a lot goes into an erection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be blood flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be nerve endings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be, um, mental stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes it's just, you want more
stimulation and there's also this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: category of toys that are just sensation
toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tend to think of them as kinky toys
or leather toys or BDSM toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, those aren't for me because I'm not
kinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a huge range of toys and props
in that world that can be used for just
[SPEAKER_02]: delightful stimulation and sensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also just want to mention a lot of
people who experience chronic pain find a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of relief in BDSM in heavier
sensations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's a lot of really good
studies going on right now about how that
[SPEAKER_02]: works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how can we use intentional
stimulation to override pain signals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so again, give yourself
permission, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if some part of you is intrigued by a
spanking, read a story about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: see how your body responds, spank yourself
a little bit during masturbation,
[SPEAKER_02]: see how that impact play affects your
arousal, see if it helps your pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: see where it takes your mind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this is experimentation,
um, and willingness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the judgment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to mindfulness, which is
paying attention without judgment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so much judgment about shame that
limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so much judgment about sexuality
that limits our experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that can be like, Oh,
that's not for me because I'm a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not for me because I'm not kinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not for me because I'm not queer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if I did that, what would it mean
about my identity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to presence very briefly
here, prostate play and anal play for men.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of men explore it under duress when
their penis is no longer working and then
[SPEAKER_02]: discover orgasms that are more powerful
than they've ever had in their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Discover this whole new way of being
sexual and wonder what the hell was I ever
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, our bodies are capable of so much more
than we can imagine if we explore them
[SPEAKER_02]: with curiosity and joy and without the
shame and misinformation that limits our
[SPEAKER_02]: experience of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you even know your own genitals,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've had this whole conversation
about sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us aren't even in a aware
relationship with our erotic anatomy,
[SPEAKER_02]: with our parts, how they function,
how they fit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't looked at them very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so some of this is just like,
know thyself and know where sexuality can
[SPEAKER_02]: fit in the rest of your life and then give
yourself permission to explore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bits at a time with curiosity,
um, and get support, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do this alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to podcasts, read books,
talk to your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are starving for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you'll find that as you have the
courage to speak up about sex,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people really ready to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's also worth pointing out that,
um, both shopping alone online for all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of sex fun toys and with a partner
itself is a really fun foreplay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's like, what the hell does
this do?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's giggling about it and,
and it creates the opportunity to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about these things kind of like,
like not kind of third person,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's, there's two people
talking about sex toys, but if it's two
[SPEAKER_00]: people looking at a website, now you're
not necessarily talking about um,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you, you were talking about
this, this, uh, method earlier where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're actually talking about the
sex toys as a, as a, uh, a third party
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, not necessarily what you want,
but what do you think about this object?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it allows a lot more,
um, vulnerability to come out naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can learn a lot about yourself and
your partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the shopping experience can
be a game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fill the shopping cart and then
send a link, um, and ask your partner to
[SPEAKER_02]: choose one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send your partner a gift card,
um, to, uh, you know, there's sex toys on
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really recommend going to a
dedicated store because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: rip-offs and, um, like falsely advertised
toys on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So avoid shopping there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to a sex toy store that can give you
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them have buying guides.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll walk you through.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of sex toy reviewers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, you can make that part of
your exploration, but also don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: overwhelmed by all the options and go back
to the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want to experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we want to connect?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of pleasures are we looking to
explore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because sex toys can also be a really
generous declaration, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you can't touch your partner in
the way you used to, if your female
[SPEAKER_02]: partner loves having sex, loves being
penetrated, loves being filled up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're having erection issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is so sexy and confident to buy a
toy and then use it with her, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: go down on her, hold the dildo and fuck
her silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is no less sex than you having penis
vaginal intercourse, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right face first in her pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that is like, so liberating
because all of a sudden her getting well
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked, if you excuse my language,
her, her pleasure being centered isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: contingent on whether or not your penis is
getting hard in that very moment and your
[SPEAKER_02]: medications are on point and your pain is
manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can't wait for conditions to be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be flexible and have
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get beyond the script,
options are limitless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lying with your partner, as they're
touching themselves and having an orgasm
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the most intimate, vulnerable,
beautiful, erotic acts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all it requires of you is your
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember cracking up when I realized the
similarities there were between buying sex
[SPEAKER_00]: toys and buying like bongs and pipes
because you know, you mentioned go to a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go to a quality store,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, there are lots of online
head shops that have got like poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: produced pipes and bowls that are crappy
and thin glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are like really nice custom
glass and they're made with care and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stainless steel involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, if you, if you,
if you like good, you know, bongs and
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes that are made with quality and
consider your usage of it, use that same
[SPEAKER_00]: head space when you're going to buy your
toys, because you know, this is certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a, a, a, a marketing market where
buying quality is rewarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have your own aesthetic with
it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And your own point of pride, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all excited to show off our favorite
toys in the cannabis realm and share them
[SPEAKER_02]: with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no shame in it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no like, Oh, you have to use that
device for pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my volcano and I love my Hitachi
magic wand and they both are both top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their devices I plug into the wall I
use with intention and they create an
[SPEAKER_02]: experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're taught a lot of shame around sex
and a lot of this thing of like which
[SPEAKER_02]: orgasms matter more and what sex counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're ill, you know, I was out of
the game for a while, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're ill and you still want to
connect, you have to get creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be flexible and savor the
moments that are shared, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lying with your partner, just naked under
three duvets.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're fully present to that,
it can be enough and it can be enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: sustain you through that sexual season.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be incredibly fallow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be very scary where you might
not even have hope that you'll be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at the top of your game ever
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you can still sustain yourself and
then start building pleasure incrementally
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe discover whole new arenas that
you never even would have considered if
[SPEAKER_02]: your script hadn't been, you know,
torched for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I don't want to silver align this
too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being ill sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being in pain sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are days where I just want to throw
my pain out the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not allowed to be a passenger
in my life anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for me, if I engage with that with
really deep intention and presence and I
[SPEAKER_02]: learned to work with my pain, I call it
doing BDSM with God, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like in it, I'm awake to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in the struggle of denial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Options start becoming available to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would help me or just how can I ride
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I just be with what is,
even if it sucks, um, it's still better
[SPEAKER_02]: for me as a strategy than struggling
against what's true and wishing it were
[SPEAKER_02]: another way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's not going to take us
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and this kind of, this kind of
exploration together or by oneself could
[SPEAKER_00]: be really renewing, renewing of the
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if there's not another person just
renewing of, of, of one's own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for, for, you know, pain patients,
all patients, and those who love them,
[SPEAKER_00]: who, you know, have had, who, who were
going to have a little success with this
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to explore more together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enthusiastically recommend Chris's
podcast called Speaking of Sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is how I first learned of her
listening to her show and learning a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: and learning a lot about, you know,
technique, sure, but like perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to think about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, um, you know, me describing your
show will pale in comparison to you
[SPEAKER_00]: describing your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, would you just take a moment and
tell folks about the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have an idea of, of what they
would be, um, you know, checking out if
[SPEAKER_00]: they, if they bother to go over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how you describe it, but it's,
you know, a lot of what we've been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: here, it's explicit conversation about the
heart of sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unashamed, uncensored, um, but with soul
and reverence and heartfulness,
[SPEAKER_02]: my partner and I have been together for 13
years and we co-host the show and also
[SPEAKER_02]: bring on guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we do deep dives into topics
like libido, and we do a ton of research
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to understand like, what is libido
and how does it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And other times we'll do single episodes
about a new kind of sex toy or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so it's, we have 370 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the episodes are sorted in a sex index
on our website, pleasure mechanics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of find quickly topics
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll also curate a little section
that'll be on the show notes page here,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it can be overwhelming to get
started, but yeah, it's explicit yet
[SPEAKER_02]: soulful is what kind of what we've come
down to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people call us the cooking show of
sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's like the wholesome, um,
but queer and irreverent, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we have been, um, sex workers and sex
coaches and sex educators, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a combined total of like 25 years
between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked with bodies of all kinds,
couples of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and a lot of what we do is we collect
the wisdom of our audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in deep dialogue with our audience,
with men and women and couples and trans
[SPEAKER_02]: folks of all, um, nationalities,
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are gathering communal wisdom about
sex, how it lives in our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then talking back to, or, and then
speaking this wisdom back to our audience
[SPEAKER_02]: week after week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so definitely please visit us at
pleasure mechanics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, check out the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's speaking of sex and we are here for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an open email policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anything you've heard on this show
resonates for you, um, please feel free to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in touch with us and we do our best to
get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between the speaking
of sex podcast and the online class series
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on the website?
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speaking of sex podcast is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's 370 episodes to explore and
those are deep dives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have people who write to me all the
time who say, um, their lives have been
[SPEAKER_02]: totally changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their marriages have been saved and all
they've done is listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm delighted by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the online courses are there for you
when you are ready for a deeper dive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in learning new erotic skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we're both trained in massage and
then became somatic sex educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot on the site about erotic
touch from couples massage, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: full body massage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was sick, Charlotte's giving
me just back and butt massage,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like stroking my body was how we
sustained our love couples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massage is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you might want to learn foreplay
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, arousal techniques or erotic
spanking and kink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we teach that all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a class on mindful sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are guided deep dives in erotic
exploration and techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're all available online,
accessible in your own home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we are there for you and you have
questions and need a little personal
[SPEAKER_02]: coaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on how we do our thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been doing it for 10 years and
go in and we love this work because it
[SPEAKER_02]: just allows us to you know, zip into your
life as that little sex fairy that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at the right time can be there
for you with a conversation that you need
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just connect with you and let you
know you're not alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so much of this is relieving that
feeling of, you know, you being alone in
[SPEAKER_02]: this and that there's no hope and there's
no options.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much possible for you,
no matter what's going on with your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am here with you in this human
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that can be so painful, but also so
pleasurable and so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully we have been able to serve
that vision in some small way here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this is, you know,
a little atypical to come on a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: show and, and, and to share this
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, I've just, I,
I've talked to enough patients where I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that I wanted to be able to bring
this kind of perspective to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then if they want to explore
more, it was an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate you sharing your
time, your expertise, your good cheer,
[SPEAKER_00]: your smiles with all of us so that,
you know, we can, we can all heal to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more fully human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for all you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to being in community
with you for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to reiterate some of the links that
Chris gave us, um, if you want to check
[SPEAKER_00]: out, um, the speaking of sex podcast,

[SPEAKER_00]: that they have on the website,

like some of the books she mentioned and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and that interesting resource that
suggests all of the, the sexual positions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?

in your head is challenging.
