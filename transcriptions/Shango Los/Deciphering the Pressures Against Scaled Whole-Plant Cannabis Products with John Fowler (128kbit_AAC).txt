[SPEAKER_00]: So John, thank you so much for taking some
time out of your busy schedule this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning to chat with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great tour yesterday here at Seven
Acres and meeting your staff who were all
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly joyful and super
knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was both fun to see what real
seriously scaled cannabis is turning out
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, but also to see a staff that's
really joyful in producing the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a very structured and analytical
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted to talk to you about
though today, as part of the company's
[SPEAKER_00]: visionary team, you help influence the
direction of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why I wanted to
come here and meet you in person is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've watched some of your videos
of your public speaking gigs and you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: hardcore whole plant guy like I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to hear the words coming out of your
mouth about the importance of sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: with whole plant not only warms my heart,
but I gotta say it's becoming increasingly
[SPEAKER_00]: rare in scaled cannabis companies because
as people scale up, manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant are kind of two ends of a
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get people starting to cut
corners and use isolates or take apart the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then put it back together in the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what the plant's about for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you to kind of share
with all of us what your vision is for how
[SPEAKER_00]: do you scale a company large enough that
you are able to provide flower for soon an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire country and yet still hold your
whole plant ideals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a challenge, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it started by giving the team
here, so there's 650 people behind us,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very clear vision to really grow great
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: To really give the plant the same
attention and love we would give it if we
[SPEAKER_01]: were to grow on four plants at home or a
couple of lights in the old world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we gave that vision and then
started hiring really smart people,
[SPEAKER_01]: they never wavered from that north star of
to put a very plainly great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how that aligns with what we're doing
is we think whole plant or I think whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is historically a better medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor, but I've seen enough
anecdotally over 15 years to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learned a lot from your podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also, there's more safety
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to say we have a 10,000 year
informal safety study on flower and called
[SPEAKER_01]: simple extract use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we show it's relatively safe for
people and some of your guests are
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally safe for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a business perspective,
when I put that on, when you do hard
[SPEAKER_01]: things well, that's where you build a
defense around your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might take you longer to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might cost you a bit more investment,
but what you have at the end is more
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our view is if we can make great
flower, we can have a great business
[SPEAKER_01]: selling flower to Canadians, which we
think flower and pre-rolls is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: half or so of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, that becomes the key
ingredient when we get into derivative
[SPEAKER_01]: products and we start to look at making
whole plant oils or tinctures,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant vapes, and eventually using
whole plant products for other topicals
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's gonna differentiate us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we put the work in here to
create the ingredients, that's what gives
[SPEAKER_01]: us an advantage as a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen some of your videos from Idea
City where you wax poetic about the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of whole plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a song and I'm like,
oh, speak it brother, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna get a little bit of that now,
because I bet you, you were involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of seriously deep pocket,
investment class people, and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: generally the folks who are pushing people
in your position to cheapen up,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And move away from whole plant because
it's cheaper or easier or more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to constantly push back to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these folks, these investment
folks, they don't have a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: background, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whole plant or not, it's widgets to
some of these folks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you explain to these folks why
whole plant is important to be preserved
[SPEAKER_00]: at scale and it makes smart money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this company, we've raised almost a
quarter billion dollars of capital for the
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to always make sure I remind
myself, you know, investors are not here
[SPEAKER_01]: to fund my hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're here to make a good business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can align those two, that's where
I get the most satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've been really proud of our
team being able to do that for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it came down to with education about
why this might be harder, it might take us
[SPEAKER_01]: longer, but it's gonna give us a better,
more defensible business over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say two companies want to put to
market, you know, a cannabinoid edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say for a CBD dominant wellness
edible, whether it's a gummy or the
[SPEAKER_01]: format, it doesn't matter for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go and we breed a very specific
plant for it, grow it in a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: way, process, extract and manufacture in a
specific way, so we have a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love what Ethan Rousseau said on
your podcast about go back to the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and breed what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't remix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a product that maybe not every
consumer is gonna care about, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers that really care about that we
think will be more brand loyal and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially pay more over time,
you know, better for our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare that against if we just wanted to
put 10 milligrams of generic CBD isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have a good business this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have a good business next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens when Jameson's Vitamins,
so the biggest vitamin company in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, wants to make that same
product, they can call the same vendor,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the same CBD isolate, and they are way
better than we are about putting vitamin
[SPEAKER_01]: powders into products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden, we lose that
competitive advantage we've built in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've lost that differentiation to speak
to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually we're behind because they
have better relationships with national
[SPEAKER_01]: drug stores and national retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, we will lose as
a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we've educated our
shareholders and investors about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we educate our management team
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we gonna win over the long run?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me personally, what could be
better than that aligns exactly with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my personal vision on why
cannabis works and how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's, you know, be serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a coincidence that those two came
together, but it was a lot of work to get
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody on the bus driving in the same
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting too, because to hear
you talk about, you know, your product and
[SPEAKER_00]: the customers and the whole plant,
you know, in my head, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always thinking about whole plant for
patients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's very patient-centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is very patient-centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, while there's a lot of
isolate type products in the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: more rec type users are using,
if you give them a whole plant product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get all these like positive responses
because it's a better experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who has access to whole plant
products ends up loving them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I know your background because you
and I have had some time in the car
[SPEAKER_00]: together and, you know, I know your
background is patient-oriented,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you were working in Canada,
reaching out for patients, helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide, helping to get the early
compassionate care retailers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in business and staying in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not like one of these other
entrepreneurs who, you know, sold their
[SPEAKER_00]: dry cleaning company and are coming over
from the green rush, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to what degree do you think that it
informs your decisions here at,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, technically you're at
Supreme, but today we're at Seven Acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your role at Supreme, helping guide these
businesses, to what degree do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's informed because of the time you
put in dealing with real sick people every
[SPEAKER_00]: day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of my biggest advantages as an
entrepreneur in cannabis, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant was invented a couple of years
ago and I think a lot of people think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, for your American viewers,
this is gonna be very odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, it was a unique concept as a
business to say people who smoke cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's medical or recreational or
wellness, whatever your purpose is,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you smoke cannabis, you want good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to look good, smell good and
taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of people watching, I assume you're
gonna think, duh, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: knows that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Canadian space, that was a
revolutionary idea, which is less of a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliment to us and more of a concerning
question for the rest of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way we approached it and
what we, we started with flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all you could do in the Canadian
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, look, if we're gonna sell
flour, whether we might pick different
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics to cultivate, depending if it's a
medical product at the end of the day or a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational consumer at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found was their drivers for
people that are smoking their cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason are the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it to smell nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it to taste nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want a black ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they want whatever that effect
they're seeking is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to build a platform that can grow good
cannabis that smells good, tastes good,
[SPEAKER_01]: burns nice, think of that as an agnostic
platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put, you know, high CBD strains on
like some of them we grow now that's maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: more wellness suited or medical suited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to just scratch the surface
on minor cannabinoids or we can grow high
[SPEAKER_01]: THC for whatever that purpose is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the platform is the same, grow good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get into our derivative
products, it's that good cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whole plant cannabis that we
treat very gently in our extractions and
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations that we believe is going to
help make us different over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny because when I talk to
cannabis entrepreneurs, many of them like
[SPEAKER_00]: the monopoly mindset, like they don't want
anybody else in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like look at Florida, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where, you know, they would just be
happy to be the only one providing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you're very encouraging of
other entrepreneurs and helping people
[SPEAKER_00]: come up and giving people good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's finish up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people not only in Canada and
the United States, but really all around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world who are putting together
cannabis companies and they have got to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide what their vision is for their
company and what kind of quality products
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to put out and where they're
going to draw their lines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, clearly you and I both talk
about whole plant a lot, but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: hard for some new people to the business
of cannabis to step into the power that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with producing whole cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plant cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you offer to
entrepreneurs who are at the formulating
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of their business to encourage them
to go whole plant for everybody's benefit?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say first, if you're starting a
cannabis business generally, forget the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis word and just focus on the
business part, meaning you start with your
[SPEAKER_01]: customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who do you want to sell to?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to sell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do to delight them
or make them feel better or whatever your
[SPEAKER_01]: business purpose is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then start working back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what can I sell that product
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it going to cost me to produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of infrastructure or facilities
do I need or licenses and staff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really understand, is that a viable
business first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something is very important to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not a magical product in a
business sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's got margins like anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your business make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would encourage people to think
about is, is whole plant a way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can differentiate your business and make
it more successful over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make yourself less subject to the
competition of large non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies who at some point soon are going
to start buying isolates and dropping them
[SPEAKER_01]: into products.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make yourself, if you're not a big fan
of large corporate cannabis, and maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're not doing a great job
producing high quality products or flour
[SPEAKER_01]: or whole plant products, find that niche
or that white space that you want to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: a Mack truck through to make your business
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my belief is when we survey the market
in Canada, or we look at a lot of the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we find is if you look at smaller
companies, there's a lot of people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: really great things with the plant,
mostly staying whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a really core, committed
consumer group that's very happy to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to some of the more scaled
companies, it's more just about supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain and distribution and being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the products aren't as good
as maybe they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we should look at that as a
big opportunity to take market share,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take consumers over time and be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean that whether you're a lifestyle
business where your goal is to have your
[SPEAKER_01]: family and friends employed and everyone
makes a decent paycheck or your company
[SPEAKER_01]: like ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to earn a monopoly over time and
compete people out of the market and be
[SPEAKER_01]: the last guy standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to do that because the law
made it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fun for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to do that because the
police went and knocked on the door of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that came before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to produce better products that
make consumers love us more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we win over the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think whether you're big or small,
you got to go back to that fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to make you different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers only have a limited amount of
funds to spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they have insurance, a limited
amount of insurance coverage to spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they going to choose to spend that
with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that mindset is no
different than if I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: selling widgets or cell phones or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's figure out that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes you special and unique and tell
that story to your customers and for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for a lot of people,
if you look on the whole plant side,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to find very fertile
territory to build a brand, differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: your products and make a successful
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to work hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you are going to work harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, thank you so much for sticking to
your guns about whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of whole plant people at
kind of like the lower echelons where I
[SPEAKER_00]: am, but guys like you who are dealing with
nine figure businesses, a whole plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: beaten out of most everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you're sticking to it
and creating a model and making money so
[SPEAKER_00]: that people see that it's possible,
I think that it just encourages everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that we might be able to have a whole
plant future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
Thank you.
