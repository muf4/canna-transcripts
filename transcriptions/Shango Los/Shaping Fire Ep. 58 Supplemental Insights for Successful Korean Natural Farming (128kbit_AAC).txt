[SPEAKER_00]: It was only a few years ago that organic
cannabis growers were rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was still on the bottle,
giving their plants synthetic inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of whole foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now though, there are a whole lot of
people in the scene who are growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking more holistically about the
plant, and realizing that our job as
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators is more to promote good soil
and rhizosphere health than it is to force
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the plant nutrients, and that it's
better for us to work intimately in
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperation with nature than try to bend
her to our will to create flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool that growth store staff are
educating themselves too, where once
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was talking hydro, more people
are talking myco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural farming is the oldest and now
again the newest and best way to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, aromatic, healthy and
high-yielding food and cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: If your company budgeted thousands of
dollars for cannabis conventions in 2020,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are now all canceled, I invite you
to consider moving your marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: investment to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: For only a fraction of what it would cost
you to attend just one convention,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can advertise for nearly a year on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a busy week as other companies
have reached out to Shaping Fire because
[SPEAKER_00]: their whole year of customer outreach
events was just canceled, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: scrambling for new ways to reach their
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audience for Shaping Fire is made up
of curious and enthusiastic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and home
growers, and you can reach them for less
[SPEAKER_00]: than the price of a postcard each.

out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is certified Korean natural
farming instructor, Drake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Drake about his one-name name,
and he explained that Drake is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: his middle name, Eric Drake Weiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to include that because I can't
be the only one wondering about his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drake is the most certified instructor of
K&F in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been studying Korean natural farming
for over 10 years and is certified by
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Cho.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hosts a podcast called Microbial Secret
Society that is established on K&F ideals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then goes in every direction covering
really interesting topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today on Shaping Fire, we're gonna talk
about wild crafting and fermentations in
[SPEAKER_00]: both natural and urban environments,
some ideas for collecting IMO under less
[SPEAKER_00]: than ideal circumstances, and in the third
set, we asked Drake a bunch of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that Shaping Fire audience sent us in to
ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Drake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, aloha, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing some of your
valuable time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know farm life is exceptionally busy,
so I'm glad that you're able to join us
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started by setting some
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of folks focus on the
Korean natural farming recipes only,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many folks don't consider what I would
say is a bigger picture of what natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, and in this case, Korean natural
farming really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, I see lots of people
doggedly following recipes, but without a
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper understanding, for example,
of why we use the fresh new growth tips on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants when making fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each aspect of K&F fits into this
larger overall framework or philosophy of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with nature instead of against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you tell us a little bit about how
you envision the holistic aspect of this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of farming thought?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the way I've been kind
of translating and bringing the aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming into a Western
language and also Western mindset,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been going at these solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And largely, I've kind of helped out by
isolating it down to nine core solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's many more solutions than
this, but by getting it down to nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the essentials you need to grow
to get the basics of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've really been working on the
language of how these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: translated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Korean natural farming came over
from Korea into the Western world,
[SPEAKER_01]: and largely the first place it entered was
Hawaii, it came with a lot of jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have F-P-J, F-F-J, L-A-B,
O-H-N, and if someone's brand new to this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's they have to absorb not only the
jargon, but understanding the intricacies
[SPEAKER_01]: of each recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've been doing is I've been
translating the recipes, not changing them
[SPEAKER_01]: by any means, but just translating them
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of, for instance, calling
fermented plant juice, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it's made, you ferment plant
juice, but instead I've been renaming it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like Korean natural farming food,
because then when you go to apply these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, if you go like, when should you
use fermented plant juice?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I ask you when should you use food,
it becomes pretty darn clear, like when
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant is hungry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so largely that's what I've been doing
with these recipes is de-jargoning them
[SPEAKER_01]: and translating them in a way that it
helps to make it more intuitive so that
[SPEAKER_01]: people going to jump in and they want to
use these things and they want to find
[SPEAKER_01]: like, how do these components fit
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just jargon and you don't
understand, you kind of have to blindly
[SPEAKER_01]: follow recipes or trust these other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the language is there where you
can conceptually understand things,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you say, okay, fermented plant juice
is food, then you can understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, if my plant looks really well fed,
maybe I don't need as much food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can start to understand how the
components, the individual recipes
[SPEAKER_01]: actually build a full farming system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's a different approach
than I thought you were going to give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I asked the question, I thought you
were going to give me actually more like
[SPEAKER_00]: highfalutin philosophy, because so often
philosophy is where vocabulary often gets
[SPEAKER_00]: its meaning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you actually went the other way with
it, which I find kind of juicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that you're all like,
well, listen, let's make the words we use
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about this process that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take it out of some of the jargon
that may be traditional, but which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilizes the process and kind of devoid
some of it of direction or meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's rebrand it in more useful
ways so that it gives a different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds really attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that either yourself or
yourself to your students or your students
[SPEAKER_00]: after your classes, that they have
challenges using your new vocabulary when,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, other people on an internet thread
may be using the traditional Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: shorthand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do both, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like conceptually, like when you
understand, I mean, the way I call things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like food, medicine, cleanser,
structure, reproduction, all those words
[SPEAKER_01]: just, it takes the mystery out of how do
you use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you need backwards
compatibility, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still need to know like,
OK, medicine is OHN, which stands for
[SPEAKER_01]: Oriental Herbal Nutrient, which when I go
on the forums and things and I go on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, I find people will say,
yeah, but what about my OHM, M being like
[SPEAKER_01]: M.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no OHM, you know, but they're
thinking Oriental Herbal Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not thinking Oriental Herbal
Nutrient, how it was in the original text.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with my experience, what I've seen is
the first translations of Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming were kind of arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just decided to call something
fermented plant juice in the English
[SPEAKER_01]: translation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to Master Cho and he is
talking about it, what he's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: saying is he calls it green juice from
heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, but that's not in the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't we don't use our G, J,
F, H, you know, but but then but but in
[SPEAKER_01]: the English translation, all of a sudden
we got FPJ and then that becomes our
[SPEAKER_01]: jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I so I realized this through the
translation that there wasn't like a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of thought put into how they were naming
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across languages, it's not even the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we in America, all of a sudden we
pick up this jargon language because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how we first received it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that right now is the time to
clarify this so that we have a language
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's intuitive for usage,
because because originally the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: names were made for intuitive to make
because it was so important to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that people are making them and
they're available, it's more important to
[SPEAKER_01]: me to see prioritization on application
and where it's intuitive application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't need to teach you as much like
if you get food, you know when to use food
[SPEAKER_01]: and when not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to tell you, you know,
this dose this or that it becomes your
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, your thing that I give to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's go back to my first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask it to you a slightly
different way to try to tease out some
[SPEAKER_00]: different meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how I ask it this time is that
so often people who have been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and food crops, they are used to
thinking about, you know, not only NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: style nutrient mentality, but but more so
I'm going to put nutrients on this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am going to make it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is kind of in service to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a lot of thought given to
byproduct like runoff and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when someone first starts studying
natural farming, they realize that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's there's actually a whole bunch
of recycling taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm I'm using other plants that
are at their highest growth potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed my target plants that I want to use
my preparations with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now because I'm not using,
you know, intense chemicals or nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: of any type, my runoff is now not only not
bad, but it is it is clean and beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: to the folks downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when when you are first trying to get
people over that hump of this is how you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have been taught to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're going to be thinking about
it in this new holistic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the examples or tricks
that you have found really bring people
[SPEAKER_00]: along with you on why natural farming is
is holistically and mentally different
[SPEAKER_00]: than traditional farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I like I like that question of of,
you know, how to bring people along with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I think I think initially if you know,
I listen to a bunch of your shows and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in cannabis growing,
you know, it's always I always see these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about I have I have this
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I add to my plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this real relationship between
grower and plant and tightly coupled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the different paradigm that you
bring in with Korean natural farming is
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm the grower, but I'm not directly
interfacing with the plant between me and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant are these microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going to, you know, my plant
shows some deficiency, I would then feed
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes a certain thing that then
they would exude it in a plant available
[SPEAKER_01]: form to be available for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know your audience is pretty well
familiar, familiar with Elaine Ingham and
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil food web and this whole idea of
biology and living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's really in Korean natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking that approach to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like like like for me,
when I go out to my plant, I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to juice my plant and get the most out of
my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to do is build the
richest, most dank, fungal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced soil that I can get the most
thriving living soil I can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know when I sow a seed into
there that almost every deficiency is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be taken care of because the
microbes are are this interface between me
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I'm not trying to target exactly
like juice my plant, but I'm more trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to create balance in the ecosystem,
which then the natural result is a
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think when people understand that
there's an interface between you and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, which is the microorganisms,
then it leads to a bigger understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, of where you mentioned like runoff
and going into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You realize how the whole soil is alive
and living in and can process toxins and
[SPEAKER_01]: create fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that just brings you to a big,
bigger how how you're more connected to to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminds me a lot when I was very
first getting into understanding organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, you know, some 10, 15 years ago,
15 years ago, I got turned on to the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer and speaker, Joel Saladin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, he he raises meat
products on his farm, their poly face
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he always said, you know, I'm not a
chicken farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a cow farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a pig farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grass farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's always like, so long as I've got
healthy soil and I'm growing healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, then everything that lives on that
grass is going to be healthier and more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to disease and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's often how I think about working
with the microbes in natural farming as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, listen, my job is not to grow
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is to grow really vibrant soil jam
packed with microbes so that whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant desires is there in some sort of
buffet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that idea that you that you
propose that, you know, it's the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of like this this go between
between the plant and myself, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't we don't really do a very good job
when we try to interact with the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: directly by feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we feed everything in the in the
rhizosphere, well, then the plant is is by
[SPEAKER_00]: by natural course going to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's totally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest, you know,
one of the biggest focuses in Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming is building the soil
foundation that the plant will thrive in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I also want to make the
distinction that Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: can also be applied foliarly or into the
root zone that you're and because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: already used the microbes in fermentation,
then this stuff is now plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can I can take these a lot most of
the solutions, in fact, all of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: put them into liquid and then spray it
onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's already been fermented by
this microbial interface, then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: directly absorbable into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I don't want people to just think,
oh, well, you just have to take the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and make the soil good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your plant, you can actually also
directly feed your plant with Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming, which is why I believe it
makes it a really powerful and adaptable
[SPEAKER_01]: farm system, because we're focused on the
soil and directly direct nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: through, you know, through foliar
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of us who dabble in KNF,
we know that the fermentation process
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the the nutrition bio available to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there might be folks like me who don't
actually know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I trust in what I'm being taught
and I move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the fermentation process do to
the nutrients that make it readily
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you I mean, you can you can get
into this scientifically and get some some
[SPEAKER_01]: big terms that you'd need, you know,
a PhD to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but in its simplest, like analogous
things that everyone can understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the microbes are essentially
digesting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so for instance, if I'm making a
fermented plant juice or a fish amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, I'm putting, you know, material and
sugar together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The osmotic pressure of the sugars drawing
out the juices, then those juices are are
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much you can think of it as like an
external stomach because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes digest externally,
whereas we digest internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of producing all kinds of
enzymes and different things to to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down the whatever material into the more
elemental compounds and in in making them
[SPEAKER_01]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's like it's just like how when you
eat something and you digest it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get energy, it's it's sort of magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you could you could really go
into the science and try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really like get a few PhDs describing how
it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this idea of of an external
stomach, I think is what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually I got this envisioning of of a
of a parent bird pre masticating food
[SPEAKER_00]: before they give it to a baby chick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't really have a fully developed
digestive system yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like we're we're partially
pre digesting it by fermenting it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it to our plant at its optimum
usability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like that that analogy that
you're you're the you know, the mama bird
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding your baby birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing that pre digestion to make
sure that you're giving the best care to
[SPEAKER_01]: your plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, wild crafting for use in
KNF preparations is at the basis of why
[SPEAKER_00]: all this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are lots of cannabis
growers who have never wild crafted like
[SPEAKER_00]: anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get turned on to KNF,
it's the first time that they find
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, you know, going out into
nature to sustainably take from their
[SPEAKER_00]: natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks who feel a bit awkward and not at
home necessarily identifying plants it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little off putting for folks to go
off and go off into the woods to to gather
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they want to gather at its most
basic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks like straight up don't pack
gloves for harvesting nettles,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, simply because they've never
done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you prepare folks to go out and wild
craft for their first time, what are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that you set them up
mentally with so that they can have a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, as much success as possible the
first time they go out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, one time, I mean, specifically
wild crafting, you know, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented plant juices and these these
different things like so when I when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm doing a class with folks,
usually what we do is on my you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: around my farm, there's there's all kinds
of things growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what I'll do with the class is
I'll have us make several different
[SPEAKER_01]: materials all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for instance, making one out of
lemongrass, one from sweet potato,
[SPEAKER_01]: one from comfort free, one from,
you know, ripe fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do all of these together,
you get to see this difference that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out like some plants are super juicy and
they yield a bunch really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are much slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm working with folks to
teach them, I like to have that diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: because I say, well, when you go home,
you know, the same same weeds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing around your place, like on the on,
you know, like just the the the the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: weed plants like not weed, but like,
you know, weeds, things we consider weeds
[SPEAKER_01]: are usually highly medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I what I do during the class
is I have a make it from multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, because I say, when you go
home, you can see the difference here of
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you may not get the same results at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you used like a dryer material or
something and it didn't in your and in
[SPEAKER_01]: class, it juiced up really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go home and you try to do it
and it doesn't get the same result.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may lose confidence and think,
oh, it didn't turn out right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in actuality, that plant may have been
a little less juicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so really what I like to do in class is
is with this, you know, get as much
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and as much diversity so that
we and students there can see and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: hold the jars up and we can go through and
we can smell the differences from day one
[SPEAKER_01]: to day three to day five or however long
the pour off takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to see these changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so through my teaching and my
preparation for people, I just try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them as many examples as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try to understand their bio
region a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for instance, Europe and the Pacific
Northwest and a horsetail like equicetum,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, it's everywhere,
grows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me here in Hawaii, I'm just like
sitting there just so jealous because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all the silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like and you know, there's
certain things here bamboo, other things I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get silica out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but that equicetum is just pumped full
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, really, you know,
when people it's how to get people into
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it's like, you know, that same bottle
you were going to buy at the grow store of
[SPEAKER_01]: silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's in this weed right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just need a few pounds of sugar
and you can get that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the encouragement I give to
people is try to, you know, many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many people, if you're not familiar,
you look at the ground and you just think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's green bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't realize, oh, that's this
medicinal herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is this medicinal herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your whole medicine closet is just
right in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny that you would
mention, you know, being jealous about our
[SPEAKER_00]: horsetail, because, you know, I follow
your fabulous Instagram at Natural Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always feeling jealous of the
fruits that you have got available on your
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that's kind of a
fun thing that, you know, natural farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: can are not only intimately aware of what
they have locally, but also the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they see other people using and
they'd love to use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, traditionally when I go on
vacation, I really like going to grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: stores and foreign countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my things, but, but I've
realized now that, that now when I start
[SPEAKER_00]: to travel, I've started looking for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fun to snack for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm also looking for exotic inputs
to bring home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think that's an
interesting characteristic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of us, of the natural farming folk,
which, which kind of leads me to my next
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people often ask me,
can they use grocery store purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and perhaps vegetables,
but usually people are asking about fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: in their KNF preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, is the more important part,
the fact that it is ripe and ready and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not reached a necrotic state yet,
or is it, is the importance that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: taken it directly off the tree and it
hasn't gone through, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning and transportation, which would
wipe the microbes off of the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to the point of the question,
how usable is store brought fruit for a,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fruit fermentation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I, I've, I know, um,
a lot of people have differing opinions on
[SPEAKER_01]: this and, and, and really the,
you know, that the, the ultimate proof in
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, cause we can, we can,
you know, correct each other and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is right or that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ultimate proof is, is in your
produce at the end, like how, how chronic
[SPEAKER_01]: are your buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they frosty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they just, are they so chronic that
your friends like, you know, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what have I been smoking previous to this,
you know, and that's, that's the ultimate
[SPEAKER_01]: proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, but to go into that a little
bit, I, I look at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented fruit juice recipe and,
and I know, you know, here in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, you know, there's bananas,
every papaya is I'm just, I'm drowning in
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, but in, in, in, you know,
winter places where you don't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: access, um, um, you can take these fruits
and ferment them and get the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, primarily what you want to look at is,
is what, what kind of biology is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that reaction in your ferment though?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you know, um, and, and if,
you know, cause I've heard Chris,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Trump last time when you interviewed
him, he talked a little bit about it and
[SPEAKER_01]: he was talking about if the plant is
washed and it's, and it has these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the only biology you have is
from the hands of the grocery store clerk,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is true to a degree, but you can,
you can also, um, you know, re-inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: to a degree of, of adding in lactic acid
bacteria or, or just even a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh, um, some sort of fresh fruit in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if, even if you had like,
you know, one wild apple that you picked
[SPEAKER_01]: and you threw that in with your other,
um, you know, papayas that you bought for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance, you know, um, there's,
there's ways to get around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'm not super dogmatic on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look at the fermented fruit
juice specifically, I look at it as a food
[SPEAKER_01]: more than a microbial inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so where the microbes are important is
in that fermentation and are they,
[SPEAKER_01]: are they making the enzymes available?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are, are, how are they digesting
this, this fruit and, and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's, um, it's hard to say,
but, but a lot of the lactobacillus is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by nature, you know, as long as you're
not getting really funky molds on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but you know, the ultimate proof is,
is at the end of the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, and I, I, if, if personally,
if I was on the mainland or where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, what I would try to do is during
fall, when, when all these wild fruits are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out, like, like wild cherries or,
you know, anything that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just harvest all that, all the,
all the Himalayan blackberry and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes amazing juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, a lot of the,
a lot of the folks who are following KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: practices are doing it in their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city, you know, whether it be in
their yard or in a tent or their basement
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a lot of folks, you know,
they just try to do their best wild
[SPEAKER_00]: crafting from where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for, you know, folks in the city,
you might be harvesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably illegally from your local park,
but you know, people take rose hips from
[SPEAKER_00]: the park or, or, or, you know,
their neighbor might have an overgrown
[SPEAKER_00]: shrub that is showing green tips in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and a lot of folks don't have a good
idea of where to draw that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that you said, um, on the store
bought fruit that, that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily as dogmatic as some,
and, and, and you're, you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested is, is, you know, the proofs in
the pudding, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what do you think about wild
crafting in the city for people who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, getting outside of the city to
wild craft is, um, is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of hints do you have for,
for wild crafting in Babylon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, so I was in, um, Los Angeles,
California, right, right down on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Santa Monica Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my auntie lives right over there and,
and she, she's a natural farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was like, you know, she was
complaining to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I, I don't, I don't have any
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, I just took her dogs on a walk
and I walked downtown and I saw all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff just growing out of the cracks in
the, in the, in the budget rent a car
[SPEAKER_01]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was enough dandelions growing
through the cracks that I could make an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing ferment from those dandelions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may, you may think to yourself,
Oh, well, it's kind of, um, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated because it's in this city
and, um, you know, car exhaust and all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the city's not necessarily the
most cleanly natural place to gather,
[SPEAKER_01]: but something like that, it's,
it's not going to, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to stop me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm still going to ferment that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going to get an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, from there, once I got my first
dandelion FPGA, then I can start to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: things in my own yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe spray that on some other
things and boost up my own things to
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment, you know, but, but, but literally
when every, every time I walked out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: city, like LA, it was just loaded with
things to ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we need to be resistant to
using that stuff because of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: say for example, car exhaust, you know,
landing on those plants and become,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and being taken up by those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then we're spraying those on
our plants, or is that insignificant
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that it's really, you know,
not worth being worried about?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I would say, you know,
in my, in my, like, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's pretty insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, but I've never done like
chemical testing loads, but, but I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always found that the, you know,
like, like people think that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the food in the store is somehow clean or
something, but you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if it came from a foreign country,
there's all kinds of emissions and all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of stuff all over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so when you're thinking of it and you
think like food from the store is clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this stuff from the budget parking lot
is not, it's like in my, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not, there's not that much
difference between it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you're worried about contamination,
LAB is your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: LAB does kind of clean up everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, you know, luckily I live on an
island that is quite natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of things that I can
wildcraft locally, but, but it's always,
[SPEAKER_00]: it always cracks me up when, you know,
somebody is pushing me on this or that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we break for lunch and
they go and they get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken teriyaki, you know, on rice and,
and, you know, no part of that is organic
[SPEAKER_00]: or clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you know, we,
we're all, we're all making our choices on
[SPEAKER_00]: which things we're going to hold to a high
standard and which things we are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to, but, but when it comes
to, you know, if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the city in the first place,
adding KNF inputs that are local as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're probably not going to be too far
distant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, but, but don't, but don't
like, you know, the listeners don't take
[SPEAKER_01]: that to mean like go to some like nuclear
radiation dump and from there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like garbage in it's garbage
out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like within your reason,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same reason we don't want to use,
you know, a straw that's been sprayed or
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chips that, you know, the city has
sprayed or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, get, get the best you
have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but also one of, one of my things I,
I usually call it rule zero is don't let
[SPEAKER_01]: it stop you from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the only thing you have available to
you is, is some stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like start fermenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get LAB in there and start growing,
you know, like don't let it stop you from
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and say, well, I can't do this
because everything I get is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, just our, you know,
the other, the other day I was posting
[SPEAKER_01]: about gathering seawater and people were
like, isn't Fukushima leaking in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't you going to get poisoned?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, yeah, but I mean,
aren't we all, you know, like don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't let that, don't let that stop me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to gather seawater just
cause Fukushima is leaking into the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm probably, but I'm here in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to gather it right at
Fukushima to use it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's these degrees of
like, you know, we live in a contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: world is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how often I hear people about
resist seawater fermentation because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, or, or also FFA, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, I wouldn't use
anything out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, then, you know,
it's, it's kind of the best we've got at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point with what we've done to the
world and being well, to use that word
[SPEAKER_00]: again, being dogmatic may not serve us in
the bigger picture all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and don't, don't discount the,
the microbes ability to neutralize
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I gather something and it's in,
in, in, it has emissions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I gathered dandelions from a
parking lot and they have emissions on it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the fermentation process,
it may be a little bit slower cause it's
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated, but those microbes will to a
degree and I, and I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically, but they will neutralize
those toxins a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your actual end result after
fermentation is actually less toxic than
[SPEAKER_01]: your starting product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, some of the places that I
help patients garden, they're on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on the city water on the island,
you know, the downtown water and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: chloramine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and regular chlorine, you can let it
sit out overnight or mix it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and the chlorine will off gas,
but chloramine does not off gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I recommend folks I'm really just,
you know, fill up a big bucket and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put some quality compost into it
and let the, the natural, the humates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost will grab that chloramine and
neutralize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's probably a lot of
that activity going on when we're making
[SPEAKER_00]: these fermentations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are natural protectants in it that
are part of their job is going to be to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to render these, these, what we'll call
contaminants inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you mentioned where you have the
humates and the humic and fulvic acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: like absorb these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same for folks growing in salty
soil and these humics and they'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll grab things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, this is the same reason why in
natural farming we build soil foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: because what the microbes are creating in
your soil are these humates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what clean, you know,
if, so say, say you have great soil
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation and now you're watering this
chloramine water on it, that the humates
[SPEAKER_01]: in your rich, good soil foundation are
actually processing those toxins before it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's, that's another reason,
you know, that you brought, brought that
[SPEAKER_01]: up, that, that that's a bit of Korean
natural farming is the soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: humates, humates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.

[SPEAKER_00]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family owned and providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_00]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent, and space to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_00]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all-gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare, and Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their award-winning blueberry muffin
is one that delights just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's palate, especially when
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar II, which has a great THC high
but looks so much like a fern that some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks can't even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_00]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor like the dill and pepper terpenes

[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously tried by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is natural farming educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Drake-Weinert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Drake, let's talk about collecting
indigenous microorganisms for a moment for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the information on why to use
IMO and how to do it outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: that information's pretty well available,
but one of the questions I always get from
[SPEAKER_00]: basement or tent growers is should they be
collecting the microbes literally in their
[SPEAKER_00]: basement in the rice box, or should they
still go out into nature and collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor microbes and bring them back to
their tent in the hopes of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: infusing the tent with more life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a good question on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole key for the IMO process is
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons you're going out to
a forest to go grab it is that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: forest, there's a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually a polyculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of detritus kind of decaying
on the ground, which is a great rich food
[SPEAKER_01]: source, which encourages a lot of fungal
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some old growth forests have microbes
that are just ages and ages old.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting idea is that as one week
of my time, for me, one week occurred,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you scale that down to the microbes and
their size, one week for them is about
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think of one week elapsed,
it's like, oh, well, a few things changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the microbes, 10,000 years have
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multi-generations, all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you go grab the microbes from
the forest, they've been going through
[SPEAKER_01]: this for thousands and thousands of years,
like equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so going out to a forest and getting
these microbes brings in these strong
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe if you're in an indoor
situation or you're indoors, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: going out to an intact growing forest is
very beneficial to bring this diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you think of your indoor area,
usually you're cleaning it each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're resetting your microbes back
to brand new each time you're cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not getting this generational
knowledge that's out in the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also bring that to that you should
probably do multiple collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those being a really nice,
fungally rich forest area around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One being right in your very localized
area, like within 100 feet of where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, that's the richest area you can
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're indoors, one right
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're outdoors, it'd be right in
the field where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by taking these three collections,
which don't limit yourself to just three,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could do more than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with these three collections,
you're getting the granddaddy educators
[SPEAKER_01]: from the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're then getting the best guys from
your nearby vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're getting the third
collection, which is your right in your
[SPEAKER_01]: growing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever is adapted there, that's the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by taking those collections from
those three areas, you can then combine
[SPEAKER_01]: them later into like, when you're
activating IMO, like an IMO three process
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're making a Bokashi out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can combine those in there and the
best of all those worlds will harmonize
[SPEAKER_01]: and reproduce with each other and come out
with even more diversity that's tuned even
[SPEAKER_01]: more to your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also take those and make them
into a compost tea if you're gonna go
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having multiple IMO collections of
those areas, you're gonna get the best of
[SPEAKER_01]: all worlds happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also love that it did not occur to
me to do multiples and then mix them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I would really enjoy doing
those three collections and then putting
[SPEAKER_00]: those three collections together at the
same time on a microscope slide and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching them to see who out competes
whom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it would happen differently in
the soil, but gosh, it would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to take these old growth
forest Yoda microbes and introduce them to
[SPEAKER_00]: some like city tough microbes and then
with whatever the hell is in the basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how they interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're gonna get the best of
all worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're gonna get like those,
when those microbes breed with each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna get things that you couldn't
otherwise have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when collecting IMO properly outside,
sometimes I'll see these like gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: white uniform fuzzy collections and I'm
like, oh, they really did it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I see some color
splotches and then sometimes I see
[SPEAKER_00]: different color splotches and those are
bad, but the first color splotches,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, oh, that's just microbe
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the benchmark or is there a
benchmark or a thumb approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: thumbnail approach to knowing like when
it's solid white and it looks fluffy and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, we generally know that we did
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we know if our colored
splotches on it are probiotic splotches or
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually contaminant splotches?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question in terms of like
what makes a good collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing of this is that when
you're, when you get that great collection
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying and you see all the white
like spiderweb, it looks like almost
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton balls kind of like it's that thick
and like what you're seeing there,
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes that you're actually
visually seeing are not actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes you want per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just, they're mostly,
I don't know the exact genus, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: about three different varieties like
bacillus subtilis and something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these three microbes that are the
predominant ones, but those, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: you see them, those aren't really what you
want, but it indicates that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good collection because when those are
thriving and they're growing, it means
[SPEAKER_01]: their partners, the ones that are smaller,
the diverse soil microbes that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: collected into your starch source are the
ones that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like if you see the white fuzz
growing, it means that the other microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in tandem with it or in this
symbiosis in this same collection are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing about IMO collection is
you're collecting these very subtle things
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbes that we don't know that much
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know a lot about those three or four
genuses, but we don't know about these
[SPEAKER_01]: soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's largely a mystery to all known
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you see that white stuff,
you know like, and you can't even like DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence it really to say, well,
we found this and that because the big
[SPEAKER_01]: three will be there, but the subtlety and
the diversity in those smaller ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: in those lesser ones are unknown to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white fuzz is kind of an indicator
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, hey, if you've got the white
fuzz, what you're actually trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect is probably here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not getting any white fuzz,
since they are partners with our actual
[SPEAKER_00]: target microbes, if you're not collecting
white fuzz, you're probably not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the target stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, I didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you deem a negative splotch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were talking to a new student
and they said, oh, I've got these
[SPEAKER_00]: splotches, how would you help them think
through whether or not the contaminants or
[SPEAKER_00]: the splotches are good?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's yet another indicator that
there's an active microbe life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're like, oh no, that's gone bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so really the other splotches and
other things tend to be like the other
[SPEAKER_01]: color things, like if you're getting
greens and yellows and these, even reds,
[SPEAKER_01]: red you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red is the one color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's red, you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like don't, you know, even compost,
put it in your neighbor's compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But those other splotches, they're largely
to do with moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it becomes super tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta kinda know your area,
know the climate and just do a few
[SPEAKER_01]: collections to really get a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's whether your substrate is too wet
or too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main major problems I find is
that people will cook their rice and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll put it in the box and it's still
hot and then they'll cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is the rice still,
steam comes off, it goes to the lid,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever kind of lid that you put on
there, paper towel, whatever, it forms
[SPEAKER_01]: droplets and it drips down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everywhere a water drip hits your
rice, that's where you'll get a green
[SPEAKER_01]: splotch or like a yellow splotch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that is is too much water in that
area and it became anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but what I tell people with that
is that really what it comes down to is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an 80-20 rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that if you go and you get 100%
like white, awesome collection,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that maybe like four,
five, six times in my life and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: probably collected 100, 200 of these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like even I'm not getting the
white every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what I'm getting is what I call the
80-20 rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if I look at it, 80% of the rice
looks nice and white and kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton candy coming and then there's 20%
of it is different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm actually those anaerobes are
to a degree part of the whole picture and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about keeping them in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I go to propagate them further,
it's not like if I got an 80% good
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, then when I grow it out,
I'm gonna grow that 20%, that
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination is gonna take over my pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the good ones, the beneficial ones
under ideal conditions will dominate in
[SPEAKER_01]: later propagation stages of our rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll eliminate those green guys or the
ones that I don't need as conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even without the world's best
collection, it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The collections I would say are no good
are ones that when you pick it up and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: soggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have really good collections,
I can take the rice out of the box and
[SPEAKER_01]: hold it from one corner and like shake it
and it stays together because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: completely my ciliated out and the fungal
things are just holding it together so
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly that it's like a, what do they
call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nato?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a Japanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you cut that open,
it's like a paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a brick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that type of activity that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that brick kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever get mush, mushy, soggy,
that's not the, those are the collections
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's shift a little bit from IMO back
over to liquid preparations because I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk a little bit about storing because
I can't believe I'm the only one who's
[SPEAKER_00]: made a KNF fermentant preparation and then
have it go bad what I feel is prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, sometimes we want a
permeable lid and sometimes we want a
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed lid and sometimes we want it in the
fridge but sometimes we really just want
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a cool dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk us through how to think about storage
of these essentially living preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, storage is a great
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you talked about it last time with
Chris a bit but when you're done making a
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment like a fermented plant juice,
so similar with the IMO, there's a concept
[SPEAKER_01]: called super saturation and what I mean in
this context is that what happens is every
[SPEAKER_01]: water molecule is bound with a sugar
molecule in this form and actually sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: holds up a whole bunch of water around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really thirsty in the way that
chemically holds water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens in preservation and
natural farming, if you're having stuff go
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, it's usually that you didn't add
enough sugar to balance out all the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the classic adage that water is
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is available water in my solution
that's not bound with a sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: life will find that and it will eat the
water and as it eats that water,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll degrade my product further which
will eventually cause spoilage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm able to add enough sugar in
there, similar to making a jelly or a jam
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve where they add so much sugar that
then it preserves it, this is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the analogy I like to draw for folks
is it's like Han Solo in carbonite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally like Han Solo is frozen in
carbonite and he's just frozen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when Luke comes and defrosts
them, the force reawakens and he comes
[SPEAKER_01]: back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this similar concept that by
adding sugar into your solution and sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: is carbon, you're essentially putting
carbonite and freezing all the microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that later when you dilute
them with water, the sugar becomes a food
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon's dissolved enough that you're
freed from this prison and now the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients haven't been degraded in this
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really about super saturating with
enough sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta just add sugar until you see
it settle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some good videos on that to
visually see because once you see it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know super saturation, it's like,
okay, I know how to preserve anything now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once you've seen it done,
you're like, oh, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a whole plugin for my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks like to show off their
confidence in their ferments by drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heck, some people just do it straight
up with nutrients generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many folks don't seem ready to really
use their preparations internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, especially in these days of the
coronavirus pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will OHN help strengthen the human immune
systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it beneficial to drink, for example,
like labs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what standard would you use for
newbies trying to figure out if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: successful enough to go ahead and drink
internally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, I just preface by saying I'm
not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not medical advice or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just based on my practice and my
things that I've experimented and things
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard from other people that I've
tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just put it in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells okay, like it shouldn't smell
like rotting eggs, vomit, death,
[SPEAKER_01]: or poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells those four smells,
don't put it in your mouth and just say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't use that one internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it doesn't have those smells,
then tasting... I drink fermented plant
[SPEAKER_01]: juice, the food, K&F food, all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it from all kinds of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I add it to my water to
flavor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, it's like an old soda
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what soda used to be, was these
extracts and sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people used to make all these
different syrups from these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use it to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great energizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I get into LAB, usually I
find that it's... So I got a story that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made a liter, like a quart jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a liter jar of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave it to my friend for a month's
supply to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he drank the entire jar in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he drank a month's supply, plus all
that sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he drank this and he was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't believe that you can overdose
on LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is if you take too much LAB,
is that LAB will eat the food of your
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking to build a lot of
indigenous gut biota or indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes everywhere, you got to use LAB in
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for human consumption, my own
consumption, I've seen... My friend didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: overdose and I just add it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a healthy person, LAB should be
about 30% of your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're always adding this LAB in,
you're going to boost your immune system
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on that, that LAB helps all the
other indigenous microbes in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then... Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought you were done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then to go into the last bit about
the OHN is that the cool thing about that
[SPEAKER_01]: is that it's all these different herbs and
they've just been fermented and then
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the nice thing is that unlike other
medicines, you can take it regularly and
[SPEAKER_01]: it basically just boosts your immune
system up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine your immune system just going
up a level and then it does... But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not like a peak that it's going to fall
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just raises it up that it will stay
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with regular use, it's just all those
things help you digest better and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: proven anti-pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garlic, ginger... Yeah, it'll supercharge
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were explaining that,
I actually got this corny idea in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we spray beneficial microbes on
the outside of the plant so that
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes take up residence on
the tops and the bottom of our leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes it a less hospitable
environment for, say for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew to come and land on a leaf,
they can't really do it as much because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's already populated heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: By beneficial microbes, it makes it occur
to me that maybe I should be doing lab
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar on myself in these days of
coronavirus so that it's less possible
[SPEAKER_00]: that I touch anything or anything gets on
me that eventually finds its way into my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes or my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, seriously, again, we are not doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about natural systems
and if my body is already covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms, I would think that the
more supercharged my skin is with
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus acid and other potential
beneficial microbes, that I become less of
[SPEAKER_00]: an environment for pests, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually use lactic acid bacteria in
my laundry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each time I do laundry, I just pour in
about an ounce or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pre-pour it in there just to
inoculate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps to clean your clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I'm putting that on,
I'm getting this microbial armor in my
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I ever sweat or anything,
those microbes will eat it up so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: stink at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my clothes are washed in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then yesterday, since coronavirus is
hot right now, I don't really want to play
[SPEAKER_01]: too much into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yesterday when I went out to the
hardware store, and I actually went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Costco as well, which is one place you're
going to get infection and it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Petri dish, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got home, I immediately took a
bowl, filled it with water, poured in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of lacto, got it started up and
just rubbed it all over my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my whole face, my arms, everywhere
that was exposed, I just rubbed it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any pathogen I picked up on that
expedition, I come home and the LAB is,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I translated LAB into is KNF police.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any pathogen that's like a thug or a
gangster that's going to cause trouble to
[SPEAKER_01]: me, it's like I'm just putting the police
all over myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're just going to go and think
of like non corrupt police because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: well fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, sometimes we think
police, we think, Oh God, totally like
[SPEAKER_01]: police allies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But imagine beneficial police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like just imagine this ideal world
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put, so I put all these microbes,
which actually act as police officers all
[SPEAKER_01]: over me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any, any thug was, was, was processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, so I felt like that, that was my
kind of bio security to come like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how am I going to come back into my home
and not bring this pathogen with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was exposed, well, I just treat it
with a beneficial microbe that will eat
[SPEAKER_01]: the food of that one and, or eliminate
that one from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it totally makes me want to take some
of my labs and put them in a spray bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, spray them on myself to
finish a shower or something or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause, um, you know,
I, I, I live in Washington, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we are the epicenter of
coronavirus and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my whole Island is locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The churches are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schools are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much, even though I don't want
to like play into the fear aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a constant daily reminder,
you know, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially on voluntary isolation at home
just because I don't want to be a vector
[SPEAKER_00]: or get sick myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and it'd be interesting to,
to add to that with giving myself foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: and adding this layer of, of, you know,
body protectants to my, to my outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even though it's new to me,
um, I bet you, you know, back to the land
[SPEAKER_00]: folks have been doing this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lactobacillus is actually proven
in meat processing facilities to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: better cleanser to get rid of pathogens
than bleach in, in, in long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so you mentioned that in,
in, you know, um, so we, my, my family,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we had a meeting last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed biosecurity and, and part of
that is, you know, every, every day,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least once a week, I'm going around
the property and spraying lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_01]: just for my plants, but that's creating a,
a, a safe zone around here where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where even if neighbors were contaminated,
that stuff, you know, for that micro flits
[SPEAKER_01]: there and lands, it's, it's going to be
processed by this LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that they came up,
even though I wasn't looking for it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let's go ahead and have our second
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about this last set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I posted out, uh, to a bunch of
listeners, letting them know that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk to you and, and asked for
their questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got a handful of those that
we're going to go through after this
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you are listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Eric Drake Weiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle is a breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine-grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators though,
building their greenhouse before gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into how cannabis greenhouses
differ from ornamental crops can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some it is improper ventilation
planning, for others it is surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of the building or the
plant's leaves or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.

more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_00]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative
and polyculture cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome, and Jeff Lowenfels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, and even my own
presentation on how to approach finding
[SPEAKER_00]: your dream job in cannabis and why we
choose cannabis business even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks are so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there are over 100 videos
that you can check out for absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to youtube.com forward slash Shango Los
or click on the link in this week's
newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is natural farming educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Drake-Weinert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to this last set,
Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get you all over the place
because I asked listeners of the show to
[SPEAKER_00]: comment on some of the specific things in
K&F that they have a question about that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have never found online or heard
mentioned in another interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna kind of bounce around from
topic to topic, but these are really,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are really specific questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might find these entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the K&F literature seems to be
written for forested areas with the spread
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis cultivation to every part of
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are making K&F preparations to use
on their crops everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should wild crafting and cannabis and
K&F preparations adapt for dry and high
[SPEAKER_00]: desert environments where nearly none of
the typical K&F plants are indigenous,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when trying to collect IMO in
the dryness of the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially the question is how should
we adapt any of these ideas we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: today in hot, dry environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a great question because I've
been working with folks up in Bend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and it's pretty deserty up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have these similar challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also been working with a few folks in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you actually on my microbial secret
society podcast, I did two episodes with
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam Bevins and we talked about K&F in the
desert specifically of how to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do these collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally, if you're in the desert and
you're trying to collect IMO, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of IMOs in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the desert sand,
it actually creates this crust that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see living on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are microbes that form this
micro crust to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference like I was saying earlier
about microbial collection is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about moisture content, whether you're
successful or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because you're in a desert,
you may need to have your rice be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more moist and or what I learned
directly from Master Cho for collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the desert is to go to that area before
you're gonna collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a week before every day,
use what we call the maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's fermented plant juice with OHN,
brown rice vinegar and a structure in it
[SPEAKER_01]: or Ws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I don't wanna get into the
acronyms, but it's the maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: solution that you would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that is is it's a bunch of
biostimulants that with that moisture for
[SPEAKER_01]: for a week before you're watering that
area, it's increasing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you go to set your
collection box in that area, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't water it because you want to bio
stimulate this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you want the toughest guys that
have been encouraged to be strengthened to
[SPEAKER_01]: then go into your collection box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there's ways of like kind of
watering and pre stimulating the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to like get the weak
guys by by watering it at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there's lots of lots of tips like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we went really, really into the desert
because more and more of the earth's
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming a desert every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anybody who's like especially into
that, make sure that you double back to to
[SPEAKER_00]: Drake's microbial secret society podcast
and listen to that in full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so let's take another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, when we are working
our way from IMO one, the collection to
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO four, bringing it up to scale,
how best do we grade the result of each
[SPEAKER_00]: stage so that we know we have a good
product before moving on to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so, yeah, that's that's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going going from your your initial
collection of IMO one, which which I call
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed IMO collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that we kind of covered in the
show of looking you know, you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for that that white cotton candy kind of
stuff and at least 80 percent good of of
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's 80 percent kind of whitish 20
percent colors mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you pick it up, you want it
to be very firm, not mushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, as you're moving that,
what I call that is just preserve seed IMO
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're putting it into sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really no gradient there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you know, you can't really
evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's sleeping, it's hibernating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you want to watch for is if
it's not sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I store my IMO and all this and
after a day or two after I've added the
[SPEAKER_01]: equal parts of sugar to the to to storing
it, if it starts bubbling, that means it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still active and it's not sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I store that for a prolonged amount
of time and it's still active,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will degrade and I and I won't have it
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as your IMO to your your
preserve seed IMO is not bubbling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just take that as like it's it's
good because you saw it at the one stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's really not a way to
evaluate it other than waking it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when you're taking it up to the
third stage and what we call this is
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating IMOs or propagated IMO,
you are really at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when your nose nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some visual indicators,
but really it's about the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically lately, I've been using dog
food and wood shavings to be a bulk
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first started, it smells kind
of oily, like, you know, I'm just using
[SPEAKER_01]: pedigree dog food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it has that pedigree oily
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wood shavings, you know,
whatever wood shaving smell they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within the first 24 to 48 hours,
that smell goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's neutralized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I end up with is a smell of a
bakery, like fresh, fresh baked bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and as I'm turning the pile and
keeping it below 120 degrees and
[SPEAKER_01]: propagating it through this process,
every time I go up to turn the pile,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smelling it and I'm also feeling the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the smell ever smells like wet
asphalt, that's the that's actinomyces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are those are an indication that
your pile is getting too hot and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to grow the wrong microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you want to do is turn the pile so
that you don't have that smell and the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is is below 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then over the complexity,
it usually here here in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about a week process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go from that smell of the oily stuff
to that fresh baked bread, then to a smell
[SPEAKER_01]: of kind of like a really dank forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you when you go into,
you know, like if you went into the
[SPEAKER_01]: redwood forest and you pick up a thing of
soil and you smell that and that that that
[SPEAKER_01]: foresty smell that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an indication that the microbes
you've propagated out are actually those
[SPEAKER_01]: soil forest microbes that we wanted,
not these high temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them like rave kids that are,
you know, kind of strung out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You produce the dirt, the soil kids,
the four H kids is what I call those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then well, and then and then
the same the same thing, that same smell
[SPEAKER_01]: that same kind of patterning is the same
for your four stage where you're mixing in
[SPEAKER_01]: equal parts of soil to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should you should go through that
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be kind of, you know,
that that forest floor smell and never
[SPEAKER_01]: that actinomycine smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that the temperature is staying
below 120 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so those are basically the you know,
smells, temperature, seeing indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other than that, you know,
like if you really want to evaluate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to do like, you know, DNA testing
and or the the microscope microscopic
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes testing with a microscope,
you're not going to see all these
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful fungal hyphae and all these
things because they're in spore form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, like when they're in
sugar, they go into these spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so you're not necessarily going to,
you know, put it under a microscope and
[SPEAKER_01]: just see all this great hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may look like, oh, there's not that
much happening here, but it's because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all spored out and they're they're
in their preserved form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not lost on me that that everything
that we're talking about that we're making
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the test for it being good and a
success is that it's got smells that we
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like, you know,
nature is no fool in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that we are going to want to
engage with smells like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bread and forest floor and sweet and
things like that and things that that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like, you know, feces and rotting
are generally not what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just brings me back to the same way
that we generally like to buy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the nose nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your let your body lead the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you bring those similarities,
it's the same as so think of think of us
[SPEAKER_01]: and our temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're in temperatures above one hundred
and twenty degrees, we perish relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm talking Fahrenheit,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, so so same like like if you
put your hand into your micro pile and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't leave it in there for like a minute
comfortably, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be warm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you if you have to pull your hand
out because it's burning hot, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: burning you, the microbes similar,
they're they're being burned as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this analogy you bring of like us to
them, it's very it's very similar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next contributed question is why is
brown rice vinegar so special compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: using other vinegars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so largely in my practice right now,
I am not using brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I am using is a fruit vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of bananas and I'll ferment
those into a vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the pH is below two point
four, I you know, I got a vinegar and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a simple process to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that that the reason for brown rice
vinegar is that the brown rice and also
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruits upon metabolization,
when your body when when a plant or a body
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbs it, it tends to flip it from being
an acidic condition into being an
[SPEAKER_01]: alkalizing condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that property is true
for like Heinz white vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just because it's largely like a
sea dick acid and I'm not sure I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure on the scientific subtleties of
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I've been told that the the fruit
vinegars or the grain vinegars are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my in my personal understanding of
it, I really just recommend people make a
[SPEAKER_01]: living vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so up in the Pacific Northwest,
you know, making vinegar out of pears or
[SPEAKER_01]: apples or or plums or, you know,
whatever fruits, strawberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these all these fruits would give you
a really good vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having your own living vinegar brings
in so many more enzymes and amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: and all kinds of stuff that we don't even
know about vinegar is one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you put vinegar on a leaf
surface, it actually creates more wax on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant surface, which makes it more
resistant to things like powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, bacterial leaf conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so vinegar, vinegar, having a living
vinegar is I would say really vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then making it from fruits or grains
is the way to have this, this alkalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more about vinegars than I've ever
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now and now it actually sounds you're
and you're right, we do have a lot of late
[SPEAKER_00]: season fruit on our trees that just goes
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be really great to use those
pears and apples to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: custom local vinegars that'll be,
you know, packed with beneficial local
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so this next question, I almost didn't
include.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, can we collect IMO in
plastic if we only have access to treated
[SPEAKER_00]: wood?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, it's like, you know,
look a little harder for untreated wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea behind the question is pretty
engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what what if any impact would
collecting in plastic have for our IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I often I often see people try to
use a plastic tub to to collect IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but one one thing one thing's for sure
is that the plastic is non breathable,
[SPEAKER_01]: even even on like on the micro level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it doesn't let air
through the same way as wood does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the micro space is tighter,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In wood, even though it looks solid to us,
if you really zoom in, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: holes in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so microbes are able to pass through
these natural materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would I would say this, you know,
what often actually what what I find to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a really good thing to use is go to your
local thrift store and look for like a
[SPEAKER_01]: wicker basket, like a like an Easter
basket or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like how woven out of grass
basket type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are great choices that the idea
of a cedar box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I there are certain reasons for it,
that it selects for certain microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But largely what we've been using here in
Hawaii, we even take up like a piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: bamboo and cut it in half and just put the
rice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I often use laohala baskets or these
other, you know, woven natural materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that like like what I
recommend is, you know, if you're up there
[SPEAKER_01]: and you like like if you're in the Pacific
Northwest and you got blackberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: the weave a basket out of the blackberry
vine and then collect in that and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting even more of this indigenous stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so what what I'm trying to get at
with with this and the plastic question
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is just avoid the plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plastic is not your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not breathable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, like imagine you're
pressed up against the plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, you're trying to get the
microbes to move through your container,
[SPEAKER_01]: like up into your rice, because I actually
bury the thing significantly down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the ground, especially if I'm in
colder regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but plastic will not allow those
microbes to move from the soil through the
[SPEAKER_01]: container into the rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So largely, if you're collecting in a
plastic container, majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes you're seeing are actually from
the air, which are not the oil microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like the elegance of your answer
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really about wood or plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all these other solutions
other than wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, like, like, I used to use
cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't really recommend that at
all, because, like, there's there's better
[SPEAKER_01]: things like these natural woven materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like, like I said, don't let
anything stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next question is, a listener asked,
What your thoughts are on non dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives for making LAB such as oat
milk or bean milk?
[SPEAKER_01]: So LAB, LAB is the most prevalent microbe
on on earth in the Milky Way, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the most powerful microbe in the
Milky Way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of omnipresent everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the recipe that we follow in in Korean
natural farming is a process of putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out starch water to collect diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: of all kinds of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But LAB grew the fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the highest population.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pour that into the milk,
the milk eliminates all the other bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can no longer digest the
lactose sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only that really the LAB thrives at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the second step by adding the
culture like the starch water into the
[SPEAKER_01]: rice is a purification step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when then when I pour that serum off
and after it separates into the curds and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whey, the whey is largely purely
lactobacillus, and there's not many other
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that so that's the process we go
through in natural farming with the milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: it acts as a purification step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, do you need that
purification step?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just leave the rice wash out and
just catch the LAB in there and use that
[SPEAKER_01]: as LAB?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in in in Korea for animal farming,
they're just taking rice bran and mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: it into water and letting the LAB
naturally come from the air and ferment
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll start bubbling after a day or
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they call that LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though it's other contaminants,
the difference is with that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter shelf life that if you don't do
the purification through the milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can't really preserve it because
you the microbes don't settle down the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way and there's too much water and
all these other other considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that alone, by just mixing rice
bran into water and stirring it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: letting it sit out, you get an LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could just every day on demand say,
oh, I'm going to make LAB next week,
[SPEAKER_01]: two days before mix it up, make it and use
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to go through this rice
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so excuse me, the milk process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oat milk and bean milk are not recommended
because they are not lactose based milks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they will not do the the
cleansing process that we intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: use animal milk for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody for some reason wanted to
make their LAB without dairy, causing them
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider oat milk or bean milk,
their real solution is just not to skip
[SPEAKER_00]: the milk step and and keep it with all of
these other wild microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use it faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, to a degree, to a degree,
to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me clarify that a little bit
because saying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, like, so so to go back a little bit,
there is a way like Master Cho actually
[SPEAKER_01]: has a recipe in his his older book that I
don't think is in publication anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it talks about a preparation where you
cook beans and then you put the beans plus
[SPEAKER_01]: water in a jar and then you put that jar
in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about a month, that is LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's doing it with just straight up
beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through this process where when you
put it in a jar and you seal it that way,
[SPEAKER_01]: you create this anaerobic condition where
lactobacillus is facultatively anaerobic,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning can live with or without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the cooked beans sitting in the
water in this anaerobic environment in
[SPEAKER_01]: your fridge, the LAB will also
predominate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, you can also get a really
pure LAB serum from bean milk type of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is similar for other nut milks,
although I'm not like someone was asking
[SPEAKER_01]: me about almond milk the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not like I just I just don't buy
almond milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't done the research myself to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next listener question is,
how about fermenting mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something like an FMJ or
something like a fermented mushroom juice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you if your mushrooms are fresh,
you could treat them just like plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because mushrooms aren't very sweet,
you don't need very much sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably like about a third of the
weight of your mushrooms could be sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they just they're not sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will extract them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a fermented plant juice that
way out of the mushrooms for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your mushrooms are dried,
you could follow us a similar process to
[SPEAKER_01]: how we do it in the the medicine or the
OHN recipe, where we mix in beer to
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstitute them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we act as if it was wet
ingredients by fermenting after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of folks fail making their KNF
concoction the first time they make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we fail several times even
experienced folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do with your KNF failures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you make some FPJ and it gets
moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it go in the compost pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the labs, if it goes wrong,
can any of the stuff be repurposed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just tossed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was to answer that specifically
where you're saying you have an FPJ and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it goes moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just talking about surface mold
that's growing on the very, very top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you get white wispy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes like when I do ginger,
sometimes I get like green little films
[SPEAKER_01]: growing those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they're pretty inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see that type of mold growing
on top, you can assume that your
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation underneath is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually what I do in that instance is
I just pour it off and then super saturate
[SPEAKER_01]: to preserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not tossing those if there's a
little mold or those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is molding, maybe pull it
earlier is what it's indicating to you
[SPEAKER_01]: because fermentation is complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: But largely all my things that I fail
with, that's what I go over to like the
[SPEAKER_01]: JDOM methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Master Cho's son, Young Sung Cho,
who basically developed a really ultra low
[SPEAKER_01]: cost way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll take any of anything like plant
material and just mix it with water in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket and let it get nasty and then
diluted enough that it doesn't cause too
[SPEAKER_01]: many problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although this is where if you're into food
safety or into medical grade cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: these things, you got to watch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying like this is your solution
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a way where, for instance,
if you mess something up, you ferment it
[SPEAKER_01]: using these techniques that Young Sung Cho
promotes and then use it to bioremediate
[SPEAKER_01]: your local park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some good for the community kind of
thing with your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mistakes go to the base of my trees and
such in the yard because there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this stuff I don't want to put on a
cannabis plant that will eventually get
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked or turned into a tincture or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also not worthwhile to dispose of
as if it's hazmat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put out something mediocre
into the environment and the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: will be stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and really, really, really,
it comes down to what when it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminate, it really has to do with
concentration in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're worried about it being a
contaminant, spray some LAB on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute it enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should take care of most
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how we use adding spray LAB on it
as a solution for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of how everybody talks about
CBD now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw some lab on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, pretty soon we're going to have gas
station LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question is, listener says,
we have some areas where we can get fish
[SPEAKER_00]: from for our FAA locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those waterways are runoffs from
Syngenta and Monsanto farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the fish safe to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will there be residuals in the FAA to
worry about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any testing to confirm
whether or not there are any residuals in
[SPEAKER_00]: in fish and how that may come out in the
FAA?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting question that
definitely be studied more scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to I want to bring up a different
instance of this, where I just I had some
[SPEAKER_01]: folks from Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting me the other day and I opened up
the fish and they were like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had I had a three month old batch and I
had a year old batch and you could smell
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three three year old batch kind of or
excuse me, the three month old batch kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of smelled still a little fishy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the year old batch smelled really
smooth and sweet like like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to describe smells through
through, you know, but but there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I was talking to them about is
that one of my friends took his FAA that
[SPEAKER_01]: he had done this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent it to a lab to do pathogen
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that his L.A.B.,
the raw fish and sugar that was put in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket at room temperature, had less
pathogens than most people's kitchens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so if you're thinking about it
biologically, the answer of why that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the case is the fish amino acid itself has
tons of lactic acid bacteria in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these microbes, again, as we're
talking throughout this show, they're as
[SPEAKER_01]: you get these microbes, they're not only
processing out like the pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in your FAA, they can almost digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you have a year old batch and
it's a smooth, fine tasting, fine like
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking level of fish sauce, you end up
where if the pathogens were processed
[SPEAKER_01]: through fermentation, I would also believe
any runoff that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's maybe like atrazine or glyphosate
or any any of those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would also be disassembled by the
same microbial set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the microbes would be inhibited
and you wouldn't have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so so by the time you're a year
into it, it's like so much fermentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: so much smoothness has come that that your
real your real contaminants should be very
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to take that claim I just
made and then, you know, run it through a
[SPEAKER_01]: mass spectrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get to know that the science is in
support of of your your gut intuition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I mean, I just don't have the
you know, if someone wants to go fund me
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last one of these audience
questions is from somebody who follows
[SPEAKER_00]: your YouTube channel that will plug in a
bit and listens to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're curious to know from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that they like your quality of
information and they know that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know if there are any other
sources of information that you think are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite accurate as well that they should
look into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's there's a lot of good
resources in Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I you know, one thing one thing I want I
want to shout out, Chris, I just I just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure, you know, that,
you know, he and I have been allies for
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've both been to Korea to learn from
Master Cho.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's now in Boise and he's offering
classes that I that I think his his his
[SPEAKER_01]: depth of understanding and his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the proof is in his pudding,
so to say, like he's proved it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so he has classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's putting out information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's a reputable source in the Big
Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be Kim Chang was was,
you know, was my instructor and also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, now now a peer of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but she recently had some medical
issues, so she's harder to get access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would I would reach out to
folks that have studied with Master Cho
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically just just because if if
you're like there there's there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different sources out there that have
differing degrees of quality, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a lot of the reason why I decided
to call the stuff I'm doing pure can of
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm really following that the the
recipes Master Cho gave the philosophy my
[SPEAKER_01]: my years of study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm incorporating this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then there's other aspects of it
where you can bring in these JDOM
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and these these other maybe
lower cost techniques and blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of, you know, researching
material, learning from folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think any of the students that
that that we've put out between Kim,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, myself, Master Cho, those those
folks are great here here on the Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Island in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Logan is starting up the Holly Salasi
natural farming institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he he has been of all the people that
I that I know personally, he's been going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cannabis realm of just like
beyond belief, you know, that that's his
[SPEAKER_01]: that's his jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he so his natural farming institute,
he's starting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming from more the esoteric
spiritual, you know, that the higher parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis that it brings in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's he's a great resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm assuming that anybody who's who's
listening to with us, especially this far
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show, knows that when you refer to
Chris, we're talking about Chris Trump and
[SPEAKER_00]: his his website is natural farming dot co.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they're very likely some,
you know, very possible somebody is
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this episode and they just
got turned on to Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my God, if we just turned you on to
Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lucky you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, Drake, thank you so much for
spending all this time with us and and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing your your experience in such a,
you know, a warm, calm and storytelling
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's I really enjoyed doing this
show with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to kind of poke at some of
the parts of KNF that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't necessarily get get covered in
a in a general cannabis recipes show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I appreciate your willingness to go
down some of these unexpected paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again, Drake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to chatting with you
again and crossing paths in in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about Eric
Drake Weinert's educational opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best place to start is at pure KNF dot
com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will tell you all about his available
classes, when they start, where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: and his speaking schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also got a really great YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest way to get to that is just
to search KNF video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll come across all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I like about
his YouTube channel is that not only are
[SPEAKER_00]: you getting the KF KNF education,
but dude lives on Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just beautiful to see what's
going on in the background and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic fruits that that I would love to be
using that that he uses on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also want to make sure that we plug
Drake's own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Microbial Secret Society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's available at microbialsecret
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last, but definitely not least,
his absolutely gorgeous Instagram feed at
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Farming Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some idea of some of the
techniques that they're teaching,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of what's beautiful about
Hawaii, some folks in his family is just
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just a fantastic feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I feel better about the
world just following it.
