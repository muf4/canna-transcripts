[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis extraction has blown up and it
will continue to blow up and become bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: and bigger for the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The array of products in the market and
the number of extraction labs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of final products possible
coming out of these labs have all
[SPEAKER_00]: increased at a wicked fast rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction is exploding in every direction
and nug runs are standard now,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a rarity like it was just five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good time to be a
professional extractor or an extract's
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Jeff Wilhoyt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know Jeff Wilhoyt as Cannabis
Reverend on Instagram or as Jeff Church,
[SPEAKER_00]: another name he used during the early days
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that he's working solely in the
legal cannabis industry, he's allowing me
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time to use his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has been in professional cannabis for
decades, working as a cannabis patient
[SPEAKER_00]: rights advocate and providing cannabis
medicine for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout this time, he was refining his
skills and mastering all of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction techniques and many of the
ancient ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been running licensed professional
cannabis extraction labs for several years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is presently still an art and patient
advocate, but he's also director of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts at Puffin Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to start by explaining
CO2 extraction and then move on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: recent improvements in CO2 extraction and
modifying CO2 machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to have you back on the
show so that we can kind of update our
[SPEAKER_00]: prior conversation talking about CO2
extractions because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last time we had you on the show was a
couple years and a lot has changed in CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm lucky that when I did
my stint as CEO of Green Lion Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to be in the CO2 lab and was able to
learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people have never been in a CO2
lab, let alone any extraction lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you walk us through generally how a
CO2 extractor functions and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, the differences between
supercritical and subcritical extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, like any other solvent
extraction, you have a solvent that is fed
[SPEAKER_01]: in through an extraction vessel where you
have plant material packed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a secondary vessel that
is downstream from there where the solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: and the extracted cannabinoids,
terpenes, and other constituents are
[SPEAKER_01]: separated from the solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, with CO2, it's done
either in a subcritical liquid or
[SPEAKER_01]: supercritical phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so kind of the difference between that
is relative to temperature and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state that the solvent itself is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at regular atmosphere, we have CO2 as a
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you chill that down and pressurize it,
so put it into a vessel where it's able to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold the pressure, it will turn from a gas
into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that liquid can then be further
heated and pressurized even further to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it through the subcritical phase and
at higher pressures and temperatures up
[SPEAKER_01]: into the supercritical phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all just kind of different ways
that the solvent acts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's a liquid, it acts just like a
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll saturate a medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's subcritical, it goes a little
bit deeper and basically the different
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents are going to be soluble at
different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a higher pressure,
certain things will be more extractable
[SPEAKER_01]: there than they are at a lower pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes in particular are extractable at
low pressures with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely do a terpene extraction
at 1,100 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want cannabinoids, you're going to
have to go to a higher pressure or take
[SPEAKER_01]: longer to do the extraction because
they're less extractable at the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the main difference
between every other solvent that's used
[SPEAKER_01]: and CO2 is this pressure component to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With butane and alcohol, heat is a
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you run either of those solvents hot,
you're going to produce an extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: has more constituents in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be more chlorophyll with
a hot extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically CO2 extraction is very
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid fed through the plant material,
the cannabinoids and terpenes and other
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents are extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that higher pressure liquid goes
through a valve that regulates the flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also sets the pressure in the
extraction vessel at a higher point than
[SPEAKER_01]: in the separation vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that does is it takes that liquid or
supercritical or subcritical fluid and it
[SPEAKER_01]: changes it into a gas state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll also have heat on the separators
that are aiding in this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens there is you've got all
of your extract is in the fluid and then
[SPEAKER_01]: once that fluid is turned into a gas,
the extract is left behind and the gas is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to rise and be funneled off through
the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piping into another part of the extraction
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that flexibility between
supercritical and subcritical,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like you get two tools for the
price of one because you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility on how you run your material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's really a rainbow tool
set, not just two tools because
[SPEAKER_01]: subcritical at low pressure is going to
extract one set of constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher the pressure gets and the
higher the temperature gets, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents that you're going to extract
until you hit supercritical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it just keeps on further opening up
what the constituents are that it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to easily extract the higher the pressure
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can be selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can target certain constituents and
leave other ones behind with pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really interesting things
that are done on some extractors where
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your higher pressure
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have three cascading lower
pressure separators where your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and thicker, waxier
constituents are going to fall out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first separator because it's at a higher
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as the pressure goes down,
terpenes become insoluble in that liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 and so they drop out and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to fraction things out that
way with different pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who's listening who's like,
oh my God, this is going to be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: technical show, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like this the whole
time because actually what we're mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be talking about today are
applications for CO2 and how CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions are being used now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to make sure we get through the
supercritical versus subcritical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but stay with us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that of our first
application, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oil that is coming out of CO2 labs for
dabbing or vaping now is incredibly tasty
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's way better than the stuff that
was coming out of labs in 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 where unfortunately a lot of CO2 got
a bad reputation for not being tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has changed during that time between
2014, 2015 and now that's made such a
[SPEAKER_00]: profound impact on the tastiness of CO2
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has really changed in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say for my practices in the lab,
I've really come full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping into CO2, I was originally
producing products that were very akin to
[SPEAKER_01]: the oil that I'm producing now back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really on quality of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running full nug back in 2013 at the
first runs that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some really amazing oils that came
out that didn't need any winterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of the material was just
spectacular, but the reality is back then
[SPEAKER_01]: that quality of material was not going to
produce enough oil to make it profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody turned to the other direction
and said, this trim makes really good
[SPEAKER_01]: fiscal sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that the majority of processors
went that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of processors that I know
of that always have tried to strive for
[SPEAKER_01]: having that highest quality input material
to make the highest quality extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it really wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95% plus of the market has really just
been this oil that's like blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't really excite you too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke it, you'll get your high,
but it's not a very unique high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to most other cartridges
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, there was so little
knowledge about how to retain terpenes in
[SPEAKER_01]: your extract and do this that you would
just do your extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd get this big puck of waxy oil,
you'd douse it in alcohol, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: would cook the extract in a rotavapes to
remove that alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you do that, you're removing
the majority of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most companies, they would just go all the
way down until they had a thicker oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they knew that the majority of
the alcohol was out of it, but they'd end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with an oil that for the cartridge
technology was not feasible to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies back then, they would
cut it with propylene glycol as a
[SPEAKER_01]: viscosity altering agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that propylene glycol vaporizing
it is really unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Government studies have come out about the
tobacco vaping industry, and it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People back in the day were putting
cannabis in there, which might even be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better than vaping nicotine
because you've got some anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: potentials in an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, that's not here nor there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people are starting to get to the
point where they're making a product that
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of having to compromise and add in
these cuts or leave alcohol in your
[SPEAKER_01]: extract to keep the viscosity right,
there were all kinds of things that were
[SPEAKER_01]: done to make this alcohol extracted or
winterized oil be something that the
[SPEAKER_01]: market desired, but nobody was really able
to make it unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have a little flavor of the strain
that you were vaping, but it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where we've come to today is
we're back to the point where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: worthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wholesale market on cannabis,
it's so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're an extractor, sure,
it still costs twice the amount to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: flour as it does to buy trim, but if the
product that you're getting is way,
[SPEAKER_01]: way more than twice preferable by the
consumers, then it makes sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what we're doing is just using full
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of cases, it's trimmed flour that
we're using as well, so something that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be bag-ready and would have been
sold as flour back in 2013 because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: worth so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's so much cannabis on the
market that it's not worth as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing now is sourcing this
amazing material, and we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: complete our extractions without having to
winterize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were running trim, we would have
tons and tons of wax, lots of lipids in
[SPEAKER_01]: our extract, and it wouldn't be something
you would want to smoke out of vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking lipids is pretty harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not something you really want to
take a nice fat dab of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking, too, the market dynamics
that you were describing where you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get these not only a nug run,
but a trimmed nug run compared to what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the value has shifted in the market,
the price has plummeted on flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really bad for the
producer-grower on the farm, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side, it's a huge boon for the
customer who's now getting a much
[SPEAKER_00]: preferable product at the same price that
they were getting carts and dabs for back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in your role as the extractor,
I just got to assume that it's way more
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying to be working with full flour
let alone trimmed flour than just using
[SPEAKER_00]: the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the farmer's losing,
but you and the customer are winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's so much that the
farmer's losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, they're not getting the same
prohibition dollars that people were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting back in 2013, but it's a
commodity, and the market has set the
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a price for how much
is being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer is always losing out in this
market no matter which way you look.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price is going to go down until it
hits that spot where it levels out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I crack open a nice big 8,000 gram
bag, a bag of flours, and I'm pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: these nugs that are six, eight,
10 inches long, some of them, and shoving
[SPEAKER_01]: them into the extractor, it's just an
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, way more satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more question for you before we
go to our first break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I have known each other for a long
time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you go back working with
patients, and you have helped patients
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what RSO, Rick Simpson Oil,
also known as ethanol hash oil preferably
[SPEAKER_00]: is and how to use it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's got a place close to your
heart, and I also know that CO2 is close
[SPEAKER_00]: to your heart as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this new adult rec market, I'm finding
people are selling stuff as CO2 RSO,
[SPEAKER_00]: which to me sounds like an oxy moron
because the whole point of CO2 is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a partial extraction, and you're not
getting the whole plant lipids,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, like you said you don't want
for a dabble oil, but you do want in an
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe that there's realistic room
in a market for a CO2 RSO, or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that, as I do, it's people trying to get
to an RSO product by cutting corners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you were going to cut corners,
it would not be extracting it with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: RSO is something, Rick Simpson Oil,
for lack of a better name, he's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that popularized this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a solvent extraction technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing it with ethanol is probably the most
cost-effective way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have chlorophylls in there
where your CO2 extraction is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: devoid of chlorophylls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a constituent that is not as
extractable with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer your question, it's a different
product, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if CO2 RSO is the best term,
but I think that what they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get at is we've got this oil that we're
selling you as a vaporizable product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really we're calling it RSO so that
the consumer knows that we've decarbed it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even though they're completely
different as far as the appearance of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you're going to have a much
different product from CO2, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that the desired effect is going to be the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a decarbed
cannabinoid load in a CO2 oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's much more expensive to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's the best way to
produce an RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if that's the equipment you have,
that's the equipment you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your lab is a CO2 lab and you don't
have an ethanol lab, well, looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making CO2 RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit that your repackaging of my
perspective on it makes me feel actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot better because when I see it in the
stores, I feel like people are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross market a product that's clearly not
a whole plant ethanol hash oil from CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like your interpretation of maybe
they're not trying to get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have to use the term RSO to
signal to the consumer that this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: decarbed edible product because we haven't
really developed that language yet for
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what the liquor control board
allows you to do, you're only allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell 10 milligram size servings if it's
for eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way you would be able to sell
an RSO for eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've confused it in that sense to where
all of these processors are having to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce an RSO and sell it for
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not what anybody should be doing
with an RSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely interesting, but there are
lots of RSO carts out there on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: which really surprises me that people put
this chlorophyll rich alcohol extract into
[SPEAKER_01]: a cartridge, but that's a whole other
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the term RSO is, I don't
know, I think we need to get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal thoughts are if it's an
ethanol extract, you should call it EHO,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanol hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like BHO is butane hash oil,
PHO is propane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more scientifically correct than
calling it Rick Simpson oil which really
[SPEAKER_01]: describes a man who brought this medicine
to the public, the ability to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I would venture to say that
nobody in the recreational market is
[SPEAKER_01]: making RSO the way that Rick Simpson did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used Naptha, which is a really nasty
solvent, but it's readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's got some carcinogenic
parts to it, having a really heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid load for these patients was
the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, even though there was some
bad coming in with the medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the good outweighed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He saved a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The RSO, it's really just that term
because this guy popularized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, RSO, Rick Simpson didn't have
anything to do with that CO2 oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2 RSO, or anything any of the other
RSO on the market other than the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is what they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how many people talk about
RSO for things without actually knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's made of in a particular process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just all part of being in an early
market and us figuring out ourselves what
[SPEAKER_00]: to call it to communicate to the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: God help the consumer trying to get
educated as this education drifts down
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly but surely to the retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing while we're on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, when you look at what the consumer
perceives CO2 as, it's got a really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most CO2 is pretty bland.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Puffin Farm, what we've done is we've
said we're setting a standard that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be of at least this quality for it to
be extra virgin flower oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say on the package it's processed with
CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full disclosure to everybody that
that's what's being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to set it apart from CO2 by
calling it the EVFO, the extra virgin
[SPEAKER_01]: flower oil, to make this new subset
because our CO2 doesn't really fit in with
[SPEAKER_01]: what most of the market is still today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is?
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is the non-winterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is it tastes just like the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took that flower and broke it apart
and smelled it, that's the flavor that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting from an EVFO cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't equal like that and if it's
not lipid free enough, it goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: winterized oil and that gets sold to a
processor for making edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why when I am shopping in
Washington, I buy your Puffin Farm oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to that commercial now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Jeff Wilhoyt,
Director of Extracts at Puffin Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you do have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're not really ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for Moon
Time Medicinals in Humboldt County at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoonTimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean that they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on four
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they've promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making you a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Jeff Wilhoyt, Director of
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts at Puffin Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
just kind of some general questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been coming up contemporarily about
CO2 and CO2 products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jeff, I want to talk more in this
second set about best practices and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that can happen in the lab
to make a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this section, I will be upfront that
I get over my head fast in a lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not going to front and pretend to
know extraction at your level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to lean on your depth a little
bit and have you guide where to go next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about best
practices in your lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would like you to share with us
is some of the simple things that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: realized in your lab between the early
days of 2014 and now that is causing you
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop this product that's winning
awards and is clearly popular in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talked about this setting up
the show, some of the stuff that you had
[SPEAKER_00]: to say was actually really quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say is one best practice in
your CO2 lab that is leading to these
[SPEAKER_00]: championship oils that you're putting on
the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so there's one thing, and I've
already talked about it quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: is quality material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that quality in, quality out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it extra virgin flower oil because
it's flower oil, not trim oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that high quality material
leads to an extract that you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to winterize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you winterize, you're losing
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your most volatile terpenes, which are the
ones that you'll smell when you break open
[SPEAKER_01]: a bud, those are going to go out with your
alcohol when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit more of a full plant
extract if you leave a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not removing anything with a
secondary solvent that's selective and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically won't extract certain
constituents, then you're really having
[SPEAKER_01]: that full plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say another really, really key thing
is we don't deconstruct things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all one extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you deconstruct things, if you take the
terpenes and separate them off,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you take the cannabinoids and
separate them off, you've got these two
[SPEAKER_01]: different fractions, and then you
winterize the cannabinoid fraction to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove lipids, and then get that as clean
as you can, and then you add back the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things don't always match up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very close to what the flower was that it
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would think that as you're
separating out the parts, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: separating an analog source into digital
parts, and there's a little bit lost at
[SPEAKER_00]: each part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put it back together,
you're losing quite a sum.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely lost parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's changed parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have to heat something up to the
point where, or pull it into deep enough
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum to the point where it's going to
distill out like the terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you remove those terpenes first,
there's something that's been changed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you extract it all with a single
solvent, all of it has been treated the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have a product that is
very close to what the plant was,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than removed and then deconstructed
and then reconstructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you throw in a quick description
of what winterizing is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while you and I use it as common
parlance, a lot of folks in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so winterizing is simply the act of
removing the lipid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you do is you take your oil
and you put that into alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dissolve the oil into alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lipids are not, most lipids are not very
soluble in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll stay kind of, they'll not
dissolve into a suspension, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to filter them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you freeze that alcohol and oil
mixture or winterize it, even more lipids
[SPEAKER_01]: will solidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the terpenes and cannabinoids stay in
the liquid solution of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So winterization, you put your oil in the
alcohol, you put that alcohol and oil into
[SPEAKER_01]: the freezer, you freeze it, then you
filter it, usually with some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum filtration, basically pouring it
into a filter and having a vacuum draw on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of that filter so that the
alcohol soluble constituents come through
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're left with a puck of lipids on
the filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's winterizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got all of this oil that's
diluted in alcohol and you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to bring this full circle and bring it
back home, and the reason why you do
[SPEAKER_00]: winterize is because you want to remove
these lipids, which are harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go through this process so that the
end smokable product is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a clear product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to the eye, it's a little bit more
desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winterization had been used to put it in
earlier cart technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cartridge technology, the lipids would
just gum it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, you could put raw CO2 that's
full of lipids into a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't recommend it to anybody,
but the technology is there where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to smoke thicker and thicker things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put pure distillate into a
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's the thickest that
you're going to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene free for the most part into a
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the benefit of that is from all these
new carts, because that would never have
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with a wicking cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the C cell technology in
particular is really making for the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability for us to vaporize anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, big fans of C cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's lock down another best practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's something else that you're doing
in the lab that you're finding a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: value in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, one thing that I really like
to do in the lab is reuse the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so Eden Labs and other
companies, they'll tell you, don't reuse
[SPEAKER_01]: your CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have too much water in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One reason or another, your CO2 is going
to be less pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in practice, I've noticed that there's
not much less ability to extract from
[SPEAKER_01]: reused CO2 as there is from fresh CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, CO2 production uses fossil
fuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses energy that we have to create
those bottles of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's diesel in the trucks that are
used to ship that CO2 around and deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: it to your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using energy to deliver this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that the best thing that we
can do is reuse everything that we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any degradation to the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned a potential for
water or at least the suspicion of water
[SPEAKER_00]: in the in the reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you noticed any different in your
final products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, you run using recycled
CO2 all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've used just fresh and gone
straight fresh CO2 and I haven't noticed a
[SPEAKER_01]: yield difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't noticed anything different as
far as, you know, what the product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, realistically, there's very little
water that's going to make it into your
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulator tank on a CO2 system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just you're not really going to
have much there because most of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to drop out in your separator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the separator should be at a low
enough pressure or low enough temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: that the water is not going to boil,
right, because you wouldn't want that hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with your oil sitting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so your oil and your water from every
run is going to be in your separator and
[SPEAKER_01]: not it doesn't carry over as a gas into
the accumulator, at least not in a large
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There there there is some carryover,
just like there's some carryover of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, you could say that that
there's going to be more terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: that will collect in the accumulator as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using it, you're kind of recycling
those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so, you know, I just like to do
everything as green as possible and and be
[SPEAKER_01]: as little of a burden on the earth as I
can while I'm producing the extracts that
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to tell you that that hearing
this as one of your best practices is
[SPEAKER_00]: heartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also not, you know, not what I was
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting you to give me another,
you know, very technical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's, you know, considering how
bad our industry is right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as, you know, green footprint or
our CO2 footprint goes between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making all the packaging and
using plastic for a one gram nug and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights that we need to use to grow
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fact that that we are able to
even take baby steps and to start
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing, you know, green ideology into
the scene, I think is overdue and a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and one other thing that we
do, some other companies do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most companies don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell a one gram cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Washington state, we're limited to
one gram sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most extract that you're
allowed to sell in one package.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the wicking cartridges that were
out there, one grams were horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, you would have almost
every time you would have a leak by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time you got through a gram of extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the majority of people went over to a
half gram cartridge because it was much
[SPEAKER_01]: more reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were only going through a half gram of
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had less less chance for that to leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the profit margin is a little bit
better on selling the half grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to, you know, you're selling
two units and you have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: markup on each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the majority of the industry has gone
to half gram cartridges and we sell half
[SPEAKER_01]: gram cartridges because that's what most
consumers want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also sell gram cartridges and
really would prefer to sell gram
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges, you know, so that we have less
waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much waste that goes into this
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got to try every step to
improve what we're doing so that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: less waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more question for you before we
go to commercial and it's on the same idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of efficiencies of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you'll get a half gram cart
for X amount of money and then you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: a full gram cart for, you know,
usually slightly less than double the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of the half gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, they call them
different names, different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call them tankers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of people call them syringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's a packaging that is sold
with the assumption that you have your own
[SPEAKER_00]: empty cartridge at home that you're going
to, you know, squeeze this syringe into
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tankers or syringes tend to have a
really nice price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whenever given the option,
I will always buy a syringe and refill my
[SPEAKER_00]: Jupiter cartridges that fit my C cell at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, it doesn't seem like it's
all that much more hassle to put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge as it is in a syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on behind the scenes in the
lab that explains why tankers or syringes
[SPEAKER_00]: are so much less than a one gram cart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the filling cost is equal on a
cartridge or a syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might even be just a hair easier to
fill the syringe, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost equal, almost equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really going on is the price of the
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we go with the best syringe
that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we could find, and that's an all
glass syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pyrex, no, I mean, no plastic,
no silicone plunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is glass on glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cost of that is way less than the
cost of either a full gram or a half gram
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's, it's really, I mean,
we're selling the oil for the exact same
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the packaging that is changing
what the cost is to the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I actually way prefer
getting the syringe, not only because I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to use my own carts, but,
you know, I have a hard time throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: those glass on glass syringes away because
they're so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know what I'm going to
use them all for someday, but I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of used ones that are
just, you know, empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, waiting for the right
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really the way,
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, I would really push
anybody that's thinking of producing a
[SPEAKER_01]: high terpene content product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get away from the plastic syringes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't even use something that
has a silicone plunger and a glass barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for the full glass on glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's that much better,
you know, when you, when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: silicone plunger or you've got the plastic
syringe, you have terpenes in there that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's getting into your oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when, when you buy like a
gram of distillate, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, one of those things that has a
silicone plunger in it, by the time you
[SPEAKER_01]: plunge down towards the end of it,
you'll notice that the distillate that was
[SPEAKER_01]: clear at the beginning of the gram has now
become cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of the lubricants that
are used in, um, in these syringes,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or tankers, whatever you want to call
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and because of it, uh, you know,
it, yeah, it's, it's, it's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, um, things, you know,
the, the, the, uh, silicone lubricants
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, uh, terpenes themselves are
corrosive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, you know, they're alcohols,
so they're going to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to break down anything,
uh, that they can solve, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go with glass, all glass, not just,
not just a glass, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tanker with a silicone plunger,
glass on glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is Jeff Wilhoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Wilhoff, Director of Extracts at
Puffin Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using pesticides when growing cannabis has
been common for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, though, we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that most pesticides formulated
for food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: use with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested to be eaten in tiny
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not been tested to be inhaled
and especially not concentrated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical residues from pesticides are not
healthy for anyone, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: especially dangerous for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercial cannabis growers,
this has become very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis enthusiasts and patients have
gotten educated enough that they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who used pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but states across the
country have begun making pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: testing mandatory on all licensed cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come to find a better way to
fight garden pests than covering your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some good bugs fight your bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects and predatory mites
have come a long way since we were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs online and putting them in the
grow room and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies Biocontrol can help you
solve pest issues without using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies founder Shane Young
learned best practices from working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and has
fine-tuned those strategies specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for large cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane works with commercial cannabis
clients across the country to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep their crops safe and pest-free
without the use of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Enemies has proven solutions for
spider mites, aphids, thrips, russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, broad mites, shoreflies,
whitefly, and others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on Natural Enemies for
expertise and excellent service.

[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Lowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is Jeff Wilhoyt,
Director of Extracts at Puffin Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff, this next section, I want to talk
more about getting hands on with the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, when we first met,
one of the first things you had told me is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were, you were modding yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, that scared the hell out of me,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're taking this, you know,
this $80, $100,000 machine and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to fix it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, you know, you've had a lot of
success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've mentioned some other things
to me over the years that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's talk a little bit about
modding machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if I remember correctly,
let's, let's start with your first mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a retrofit of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I remember correctly, you owned an
apex machine and you wanted it to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something that it didn't do out of the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of break that out and especially
if it's still relevant today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of funny, you know,
Apex was born out of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andy Joseph, the, the manufacturer of
Apex machines, he was the welder for the
[SPEAKER_01]: high pressure welder for Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was out of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fritz, the owner of Eden Labs was from
Ohio as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's how they knew each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point they had this falling
out, you know, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: things, things happened and he decided to
make his own machine and started a
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I didn't purchase the Apex machine,
but it landed in my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so we had this machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gas booster technology,
which was not, you know, the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of an old technology at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this machine that was built by Andy
that kind of had everything good on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was good engineer, but he didn't really
understand cannabis extraction and what
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to be happening while the
extraction was, was actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were some things about the
machine that didn't quite work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we would be running our runs and
have our separators icing over because
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the heater capacity wasn't,
wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have all kinds of different
issues with the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what we did, we were not
able to get a very high yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were hitting 5% yields as
kind of our highest, highest that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was an old 1500 PSI machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was based on a lot of the
technology in the machine itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily the extraction vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vessel was rated, you know,
above 2000 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were talking with Eden Labs
because they're here in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Andy was all the way over in Ohio and
we'd get, you know, one story from Andy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he didn't really know exactly too much
about it in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't know too much about running the
extractors to extract cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, had Eden Labs here and they
were happy enough to reach out and help us
[SPEAKER_01]: any way that they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lent us heat baths to try and
overcome the issues so where we would
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, our heater wasn't capable
of producing enough heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: To stop it from freezing over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would lend us heat baths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally it came to the point where we
were like, yeah, you know, what we really
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do is have an Eden high flow
liquid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be instead of a gas booster
where gas is compressed by the pump into
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid and then that liquid is shot into
the extraction vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a liquid pump where liquid was
pumped from an accumulator tank on the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine through the extraction vessel and
then it would end up back as a liquid in
[SPEAKER_01]: the accumulator tank after it goes through
the whole machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of the way that the machines were
running were way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The liquid aspect allowed for a lot more,
a lot higher flow rate of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since, you know, extraction is really
based on flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how much solvent are you moving over
the material and how much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just decided, hey, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked with Eden Labs on designing a
retrofit that was kind of custom to the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And got a secondary skid that sat right
next to our machine that had a pump on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to double our extraction
yield and cut down the time that it took
[SPEAKER_01]: to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were running up to 12 hours
and getting only 5% on the Apex 2013
[SPEAKER_01]: series machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to cut that down to four
hours and be able to reliably get 8 to 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: winterized oil out of it after we were
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so, you know, the retrofit,
it's really, you know, it's kind of this
[SPEAKER_01]: leap of faith that we took.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, hey, you know, we think that this
other system is going to work better for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the numbers seem to equate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had them design it, manufacture it,
and we tried it out and everything worked
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound like a cheap mod,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like that probably cost you a
couple of tens of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doubling your yield and cutting your
time by 60%, 80, 70 ish percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great win, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think at the time it was like 36
grand to do it, which compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: price of a new five liter extractor at
that point, which was like, I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: were like 80, 96 or 90,000, somewhere
around that range at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way cheap, you know, and they were
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked with us and helped us be able
to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, another thing I like about
it, too, is that I'm always a fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractors not being afraid to get under
the hood and make some non-stock changes
[SPEAKER_00]: to their gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was just going to say, because,
you know, so often they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, we want to keep it just
like it was sold to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so often the machines are sold kind of
like as a mean, like, OK, this is the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of machine that people, everybody
generally needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your specialty is one thing or
another, you know, you might as well hot
[SPEAKER_00]: rod it in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, these machines are built
with safety in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pressure relief valves everywhere
on the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do get into a situation where
there's an overpressure in any of any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the vessels, it's going to just blow it
off and and you're going to have to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what, you know, what caused
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's really nothing to worry
about as far as hurting yourself with one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these machines because they're just so
they're built so burly, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, and after that
retrofit, it really kind of opened us up
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, hey, look, you can change
everything on this machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the flow path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at how things are going and try
to come up with a better way to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually started doing
subcritical runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that the labs high flow machine
is set up, you're basically it's set up to
[SPEAKER_01]: run a super critical run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you modify it a little bit,
slow down the pump and put a chiller on
[SPEAKER_01]: the extraction vessel instead of a heat
bath, you can do a subcritical liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction that's going to get you a much
different constituent profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've we extracted lots of
subcritical runs and and really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: came up with a product that's similar to
what we what we have today at puffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, really high terpene content
extract that's that's free of lipid lipids
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lipids are just like the cannabinoids that
at the higher pressures, they're more
[SPEAKER_01]: extractable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to extract it,
you know, eleven hundred psi, say for a
[SPEAKER_01]: subcritical run, you're going to have a
much cleaner extract that needs much less
[SPEAKER_01]: post-processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, you know, kind of the way to go
now with subcritical, the disadvantage
[SPEAKER_01]: there is your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield is sacrificed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it's harder to extract those
cannabinoids at those lower pressures,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to get quite as much
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, what we did for the
subcritical mod, we took a chiller and we
[SPEAKER_01]: cut into the line where the heat bath was
and put in a three way valve in there
[SPEAKER_01]: where we could select either the heat bath
or the chiller and kind of hot swap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd be able to do like a cold
subcritical run, get this really terpy
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and then then do a supercritical
run after that, kind of swap that over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start pumping the heat bath in
there and you're able to get more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid rich secondary cut that then
you could winterize and then you could put
[SPEAKER_01]: those oils back together that first
subcritical run that you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: winterized and the final winterized
extract from the supercritical run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of, you know, just trying to go
different ways about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that idea actually of running
it two different ways for two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of benefits, but then putting
together at the end to make something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's better than the sum of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit, we've had two mods,
we hit the retrofit mod and the
[SPEAKER_00]: subcritical mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have one more that you might find
interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, really my favorite one and
the one that I need to do myself right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is a heat bath mod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you buy an Eden lab system,
it comes with two heat baths, one for the
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor, one for the separator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so simply get a PID controller,
which is what, you know, your e-nail uses
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, keep your, it reads a
thermocouple, which is a thermometer
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, and has a heating element
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of cycles on and off to keep
your e-nail hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing on a heat bath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that allows you to do is have
just this ultra stable temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not having drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were working down in Sodo,
just where we were on the power grid,
[SPEAKER_01]: there were fluctuations in the quality of
the power that was being delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if it was just,
we were near the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really, really heavy power
consumers down there in the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: district in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would notice a variance of quite
10 degree, up to 20 degree shift in
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature of our heat bath, where it's,
you know, it's at the same setting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because of the quality of the power
that was coming into the building,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would have this fluctuation between,
you know, the morning and the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just drilled a hole into the
heat bath, put a thermocouple in there
[SPEAKER_01]: that had a gasket fitting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the heat bath wouldn't leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooked that thermocouple up to the PID
controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then had the PID controller,
it had a relay that switched on and off
[SPEAKER_01]: the outlet that the heat bath is plugged
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you turn the heat bath on its
end with an analog dial all the way up,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you set the PID controller for
the temperature that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would cycle on and off the power,
keeping your heat bath at the desired
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, rather than running into
this, you know, issue of the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: the power changing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even, you know, I noticed some
fluctuation during the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it heats up outside, you know,
if you've got an ambient temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuation, you're going to have a
fluctuation in what your heat bath is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to have a stable,
repeatable temperature that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting at, a heat bath mod is really
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of keeping it at one temperature,
you know, it's not just for convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing science here, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's going to extract exactly
the same constituents of that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it, if it fluctuates, it's getting
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jeff, thank you so much for taking
some time to join us again on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love chatting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, honestly, you know,
with a lot of my other shows, I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: very stringent set of questions that I'm
going to walk somebody through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I enjoy about you is
that I don't actually always know where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go because I just kind of
follow, follow your path and, and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: good things come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate both your willingness to
share your experience, but also your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your good cheer and ability to tell
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thanks so much for your time in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for having me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's always a pleasure to be
on the show and chat with you about all
[SPEAKER_01]: things cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I love to talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to follow Jeff on his
Instagram, it is a great place to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: along and that's at cannabisreverence.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on Instagram, we've also got a video
that's going to be coming out here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks where I'm going to be
working through with Jeff or he'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining to me rather the, the genesis
of the hash star rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was there in the early days when
it came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to talk about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that on the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually you really should go over to
the YouTube channel and, and here and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually watch a couple of Jeff's
presentations made here on Vashon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on Island where I live for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does, he did a one presentation on
doing, making bubble hash at home for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a second one on making ethanol
hash oil, AKA RSO for patients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so if you're a commercial
producer, these are probably not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the videos you want because he's
focusing more on using limited materials
[SPEAKER_00]: and ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not really a, you know,
necessarily scalable, but, but if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient and you're looking for a simple
way to get involved with it, those are,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are great videos to check out.
