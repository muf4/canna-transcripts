[SPEAKER_02]: Compost is one of those words in natural
farming that means a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: things to different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we have conversations about
compost, assuming we all mean the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly didn't grow up around compost
or compost tea, and I only really started
[SPEAKER_02]: considering it when I started focusing on
natural farming techniques as an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I read Teeming with
Microbes by Jeff Lowenfels and got really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been listening to Shaping Fire
for a while, you've probably been sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: right here with me as I had some of my
biggest breakthroughs in understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: what compost is and why it is the
essential building block for natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is one of those shows, and I bet we
learn a lot about compost together.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to learn about cannabis'
health, cultivation, and technique

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My returning guest today is soil
biologist, Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton is a lifelong enthusiast of both
aquaponics and living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: His obsession with Biosphere 2 led him to
set up an aquaculture at the Rodale
[SPEAKER_02]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton worked with world-renowned
biologist, Dr. Elaine Ingham, blending his
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaculture byproducts with compost and
worm castings to prove that natural inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: could replace synthetics in commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton consults widely for agriculture,
soil regeneration, and commercial land
[SPEAKER_02]: management projects throughout the United
States, including recently working on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallace-Annenberg Wildlife Crossing over
Highway 101 in California that will be the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest wildlife crossing in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton is currently founder of Kingdom
Aquaponics and invented their line of
[SPEAKER_02]: living compost and compost tea living soil
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton is a sought-after speaker and
co-host of a weekly podcast on the Future
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Project YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton has been on Shaping Fire a few
times before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 54 about geology and biomimicry in
living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the episode that brought
Leighton's popular Soil Horizons concept
[SPEAKER_02]: into mass adoption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 59 on water and watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 82 about properly using aerobic
and anaerobic soil amendments to meet the
[SPEAKER_02]: needs of your soil at different stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And episode 87 where we do a debrief on
the first cycle of the Shaping Fire indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing tent where we test regenerative
techniques indoors, including his Horizons
[SPEAKER_02]: model for living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might ask, Shango, why bring back a
guest for a fifth time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a fair question and I have two
answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, have you heard any of the Leighton
Morrison episodes?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The depth in them is hard to ignore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton has the scientific background
plus is an ardent natural farmer and he
[SPEAKER_02]: actually grows stuff and doesn't like live
in a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of like Indiana Jones in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has the academics down solid,
but he spends most of his time in the
[SPEAKER_02]: field applying these skills and orchards
and soil regeneration projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: research and development, cannabis
cultivation, and he's even a consultant
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Dallas Cowboys keeping their grass
practice field thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, I looked for someone else to be on
this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got referrals from friends and peers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I looked into was an expert at
making thermal compost, scoping compost
[SPEAKER_02]: and teaching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this episode, though, I needed a
scientist who could look beyond this one
[SPEAKER_02]: category of thermal compost to the larger
picture of soil microbe inoculation,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I'm most interested in and I
think is what people actually want when
[SPEAKER_02]: they make compost tea with thermal
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, I called up Leighton and I
asked him to join me for this episode and
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wanted to go big and cover a lot in
one episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: During today's episode, the first set is a
review of different varieties of compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: their benefits and challenges with a
special consideration for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the second set, we talk about
creating the highest amount of microbe
[SPEAKER_02]: activity in compost, cold compost,
and how to use it without fear of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wrap up with the third set
discussing compost grafting and grain
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, how to make premium cold
compost, cold compost extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even make compost shelf stable for use
throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been thinking about doing
this show about the varieties of compost
[SPEAKER_02]: for some time, but I really didn't decide
to pull the trigger on it until you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had that conversation just a few days ago
where you started kind of like teasing
[SPEAKER_02]: apart this compost question I had in my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even though the goal of
today is to kind of talk about the science
[SPEAKER_02]: and the biology of soil structure,
I want to start with the rather mundane
[SPEAKER_02]: question that I approached you with
because even though we're eventually going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go somewhere heavier and more
biological, I can't be the only one who is
[SPEAKER_02]: a cultivator who looks at these different
varieties of compost that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: available to us and trying to figure out
which ones are most viable and which ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are like, you know, garbage and I
shouldn't even consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go through the list of the six
varieties of compost that I have come in
[SPEAKER_02]: contact in my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just talk about each of them
individually so that when cultivators who
[SPEAKER_02]: come in contact with these other types of
compost know how to judge them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so let's start with the most common
kind of compost, which is the bagged stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that they sell at the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even really talking about
necessarily like really good quality
[SPEAKER_02]: bagged compost, which I'm assuming there
is such a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the kind of stuff that
they sell for six bucks in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grocery store in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that stuff, different kinds
of company bag those up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I live, there's a company that
actually collects yard refuse,
[SPEAKER_02]: yard and garden and food refuse from in
front of people's houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they take that to their big
facility and they are, quote, make
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then when it's done, they put it
in a bag and they sell it back to us for
[SPEAKER_02]: six bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it says compost and so
many people are buying it for their
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens and to make their raised beds and
lots of people putting it in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I buy, you know,
when I used to buy these, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you buy it and you rip it open and and I
would smell ammonia and it would usually
[SPEAKER_02]: would often have white on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, I don't I don't think
that's mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like some kind of white rot or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when, you know, as I've gotten
more mature in the living soil scene and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the kinds of composts that
living soil artisans make, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how dare they sell this bagged stuff as
compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it even compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: So so let's talk about that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of explained to me, I mean,
I know each company makes it different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think that by probably by the time
it's in the bag, they're probably pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so teach me a little bit about what my
expectations should be for that compost
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in a sealed plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the word compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word compost is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's where the real
compost is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation begins is that,
OK, there are a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because I don't have a better
word to choose, we're going to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into what it really means,
I'm sure, in another set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the beginning, let's just say this
is a compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you smell ammonia, that is part of
the thermophilic break down of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, well, you called it junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nature doesn't make junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature just breaks down organic matter
into carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living things are made of carbon and
nitrogen, along with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: other elements from the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for the sake of keeping it simple,
when you smell the ammonia, you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: still in what we call a thermophilic
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't you haven't shifted into the
mesophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that active decomposition is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ammonia smell is the release,
the byproduct of the thermal fights
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking the carbon and the nitrogen off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't they can't eat too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are there for the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that nitrogen is being released in
an ammoniacal gas, ammonia gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that product is is unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply that to like healthy young
plants, you're going to kill them because
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the thermophites are going to
stealing carbon and releasing the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore starve the plant out because
the plant actually wants the nitrogen or I
[SPEAKER_00]: should say the mesophilic bacteria want
that nitrogen to break it down and release
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the plant so that they get more
exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in a you're in kind of a bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, the white you saw,
that's actually actinobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people confuse that white for
mycelium, but it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically the actinobacteria and
it's indicating heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that there's still quite a bit of
heat present in that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, you're dealing with a
product that is unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even be considered,
you know, poem, which we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's let's keep me on track here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the stuff that's in these bags,
it sounds like it'd be fair to just call
[SPEAKER_02]: it immature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is if our goal was it was a
thermal compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what I think you're suggesting to
me that like like it wasn't finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think unfinished is a great way to put
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as as we know from anything that's
made at a scaled level, like like even
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis flowers, if you're scaling things
up so often, the product that comes out
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, not premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these companies, these companies
are making like just like thousands and
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of these bags and they're kind
of rushing them through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fact that we are seeing that
bacteria and we're smelling the ammonia
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's still breaking down, it's
essentially just saying that they rush the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing you have to keep in
mind, too, is that at these compost yards,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the ability to separate
the greens and the browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably one of the most
critical pieces of making especially
[SPEAKER_00]: biological compost is that you have the
correct ratio of greens to browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too much greens, you have too
much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go hyperthermic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into that, I'm sure,
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing you can do to prevent
that thermophilic phase from continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: until there's no nitrogen left to be
broken off to steal the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, if you can manage your
greens and browns, you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: predetermined point in time and say,
well, after six months, this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be gone through the thermophilic and into
the mesophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesophilic means stable, safe to apply,
will not steal nitrogen from my plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and will be a suitable source of soil
organic carbon that will provide all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of benefits to soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a use case for this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you said don't use this stuff on
young plants because it'll steal from
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would naturally take that and say,
well, then I sure as hell don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: put this in my beds and put my clones or
my seed starts into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm all like, well, I probably
don't want to use this in my pots either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any use for this batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh boy, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will kill plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my work out here in Cali,
I'm working with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and a lot of different growers of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I found out that this company,
compost company that I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with was using it as a herbicide,
I was horrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my God, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I stopped and went, wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's a herbicide,
it's still carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still getting put into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still providing a longer term source
of fertility and CEC, Catalan Exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: Capacity, which is a valuable resource for
providing long-term fertility to plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're strawberries or trees,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that they're actually taking
this stuff and turning it in is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit because when you stop the
thermophilic phase by taking this immature
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and you till it into the soil,
you've basically prevented those
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophytes from producing that excess
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore you've actually put some
ammoniacal or nitrate based fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: into play because it's no longer gassing
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually has a couple of different
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, what do you do with
this compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use it as a top dressing for a
mature lawn or a top dressing for a mature
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go heavy with it, but I would
definitely like sprinkle on a half an inch
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just kind of massage it in
because you're going to get some benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from it in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no way would I put seed starts or
clones or anything else into it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get a good result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds to me that unless we're
talking about putting a whole bunch of it
[SPEAKER_02]: on a field or distributed cultivation
area, there really isn't much application
[SPEAKER_02]: for this in cannabis growing, which is
kind of our point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you take it, open it, and pile it
up and let it go through the phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you bring it home and finish it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we might as well hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that somebody only has access to
this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you easily finish it at home
assuming you don't have a farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take it back to your place and then
blend it with other sources of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wood chips, straw, because straw is
more of a brown than it is a green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hay is a green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leaf litter, any source of brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your last year's soil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a great way to use up some excess
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just blend it together and then
pile it up and stick your hand in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's heating up, add more browns
until you get to a point where it's no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer heating up to a point where it's
uncomfortable for your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's at 85 degrees,
which in many cases in many ways is the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot for biological generation,
it's going to feel kind of cool to you
[SPEAKER_00]: because you run at 98 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wouldn't be uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you stick your hand in there and
it's hot, that means it's above 100
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, 110, 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins to get very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 130, it's going to start to burn
your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good way to gauge in the field
without a compost thermometer how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: maturing your compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making up these kind of bullshit
categories myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go to the second bullshit
category, which is home food waste
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next variety we're going to talk about
is food waste compost made by an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: gardener who's like read a book and watch
some videos and they know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm talking about more
specifically are people who've got their
[SPEAKER_02]: heart in the right place, but they don't
really know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are people who they are producing
home food waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're getting some stuff for their
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have anybody with neighborhood
pigs to give them to, so they're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: it in a pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever they remember it,
it'll get turned a couple of times a year
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually it does break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stops to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably got some big chunks of stuff
in it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of lackadaisical compost,
but I run into that all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will often post to the Vashon Island
farm or food cultivators, let's just say
[SPEAKER_02]: like, hey, anybody got excess compost that
you're looking to get rid of because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really have a lot of space for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I'll get good stuff,
but most of the time it's this stuff I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about where people are making this
kind of like lackadaisical pile and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, yeah, come take this stuff
so that I can feel good that I've moved it
[SPEAKER_02]: back into the biosphere, but I don't know
what to do with it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your thoughts on this kind of
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing you're going to start with it
is also immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and potentially pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's why when you're dealing
with food waste, you really only have
[SPEAKER_00]: three ways to responsibly deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just take it and pile it up in the
backyard, it's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to attract pests, ants,
unwanted critters, raccoons, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really a smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that have food waste will
often add it to a static compost pile,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is yard waste, leaves and chips and
everything else that you've collected in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring after the winter and piled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little bit more safe way to
deal with it because you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: attract those pests necessarily at the
same level you would if you just piled it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and let it rot in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll also get some benefit to adding
in those browns, again, greens and browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food waste is pure nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to go hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to gas off both methane,
ammonia, and like putrefaction gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gases that don't necessarily, they're not
good terpenes, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as dealing with food waste,
my recommendation is to get people to
[SPEAKER_00]: either feed them to worms, which is a safe
way of breaking them down and avoiding
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic cross-contamination,
which is a real issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have gotten an upset stomach
due to something that you ate that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly healthy, then you would
understand that this is not something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to have happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: An upset stomach is no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in handling that, it's really,
again, feed it to worms first,
[SPEAKER_00]: then take the vermicompost and use that as
a supplement in your compost or as a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it can't be gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to have had the opportunity to
break down to a point where it's no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be potentially pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really the only responsible way
to deal with food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is you can do something
that's a little bit more how we say old
[SPEAKER_00]: style, which is to dig a hole and put your
food waste in there and put a lid over the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it and just let nature do its
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we would call anaerobic
digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to stink like hell down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the microbes will naturally break it
down and convert it back into organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another way for you to safely
deal with your food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you've got to keep in
mind, too, like people, oh, eggshells,
[SPEAKER_00]: eggshells are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're also got a lot of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with meats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those meats and dairies are a little bit
more tricky to comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more likely to be compost than
just fruits and veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fruits have their issue, too,
because they have a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can attract a lot of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into these, all right,
I'm going to throw everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the kitchen sink, no pun
intended, into my compost pile,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really got to go thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to cook that stuff hard to prevent
any kind of, again, attracting pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: potential pathogenic cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, A, I never considered the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to say you really got my
attention with this anaerobic compost
[SPEAKER_02]: hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a really fun project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the stuff that will come out of that
rich and delicious for my cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: After it goes through the digestive
digestion process, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does that process take?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much you piled in there
and if you continue to pile on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think of it like you've ever seen
a flow through vermicompost system where
[SPEAKER_00]: you take from the bottom and you feed the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hole, the bottom is going to be
where the value is, not the top where you
[SPEAKER_00]: just added stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you have to let that sit for
a while because you can't harvest from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom unless you try to cross tunnel
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably too much work for the worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm imagining digging a hole, filling it
with kitchen waste, and then just fill the
[SPEAKER_02]: hole and then just cover it and leave it
and then go dig another hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I've got nine holes and I think
you're about to tell me about how long
[SPEAKER_02]: that would take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I make the holes and then after X
variable amount of time, I know that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to hole one and use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then some weeks later, I can go back to
hole two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when I pull hole one, I can go refill
it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say, reasonably, since I don't
have a backhoe, I'm probably not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: dig a hole that's much bigger than three
by three, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even go that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use a post hole digger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really small hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, eight inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, six, eight inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how much food waste do you
generate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way to store it is actually to
freeze it so that you can just freeze as
[SPEAKER_00]: you go throughout the course of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it takes two weeks to store up
enough for one post hole and dig the post
[SPEAKER_00]: hole and mark it with a flag and then
cover it over with soil on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back probably, I don't know,
maybe three, five months, three to six
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you will have this amazing black
organic stuff with tons of worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if they're not three by three holes,
I could easily make 25 of these in a row,
[SPEAKER_02]: each with their own plant tag giving me
the date that I capped them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to worry about the E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the egg shells when I do this style?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because everything is going to break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have rapid decomposition
in an anaerobic digestion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli is just going to get consumed by
other biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I'm a cultivator who's in the
ground and I have got a cultivation field?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say I've got three rows of five
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I just make these post holes around
my garden and then just never get them
[SPEAKER_02]: out, just put them in and just cap it and
just say, all of these nutrients will
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually be accessed by the root zone
and they'll be pulled from three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, five feet away from the plants and
they'll just be pulled over by nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just creating these little post holes,
little caches of nutrition for the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that legit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take it even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest in the fall, go next to
the root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I don't want you to take that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's valuable nutrition, but go next to it
and dig a hole and put it in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: next to your plant right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have six months of digestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black gold, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is one other piece that I left
out in dealing with food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's been a big topic over the last
five years about JDOM and natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things you can do,
especially if you have a situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: you had a party and you have all this
leftover food like hamburgers,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot dogs, steak, chicken, pork,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a trash bucket full of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do is actually take that and
cover it with water and put a wire mesh or
[SPEAKER_00]: wire cloth over the top of it so it's held
down and weight it so that the food and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything underneath it is under the
surface of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a way to basically break it
down into enzymes very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those enzymes can be used again in a
thermophilic compost and really make that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost explode biologically because
you've got all of the secondary and
[SPEAKER_00]: tertiary metabolites in biological food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the biology is just going to go
ballistic when it comes in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff because it's just ready to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like McDonald's and Burger King.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another component to dealing with
food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I recommend doing that on a smaller
scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not because it's going to be a
pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas digging a post hole and dumping
some frozen scraps for the last two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very easy to do method whereas this
fermentation process takes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, now you've got this bucket that you
have to let sit for a minimum of probably
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days until you've gotten through the
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to see foam on the
surface of the water and other indications
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's still very highly active.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to uncork this while it's
in this anaerobic digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stink like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends again on the size of the
container, how much you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much meat versus how much vegetables,
as to how long it will take to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a period of time, it won't even
stink anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be slimy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably get a kombucha mother on
the top of it, but it won't smell anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you know, okay, this stuff is
rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rocket fuel for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I take this and add it to my compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those mobile nutrients that could
wash through the soil very quickly if it
[SPEAKER_00]: rained will be consumed very quickly by
the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's in the stank stage, do not get
that stuff on you because you will smell
[SPEAKER_02]: for days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so our next category is going
to be, for lack of a better term,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call it curated compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the kind of compost that is made
by organic gardeners, your friend who
[SPEAKER_02]: knows better, took a class, read a couple
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creating their pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're even making sure that
certain types of foodstuffs are in there
[SPEAKER_02]: so that the compost that comes out of it
has a particular nutrition ratio that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting turned on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a compost thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking kind of like crème de la
crème of heated compost piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're very lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the weed that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, hey, I've got extra of this
stuff when you want to bring over your
[SPEAKER_02]: pickup and get what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're like, hell yeah, and you go
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about this compost compared to the
other stuff we're talking about so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'd have to believe that
this compost curator has gone through the
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic phase and into the
mesophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, didn't rush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used the proper green to brown
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they used food waste or manure,
we call those high nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they're using high nitrogen
sources responsibly, so less than 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are going through the process of
turning it, like you said, until it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point where it no longer continues
to go thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've pushed it into the mesophilic
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a what I want to call
nutrient dense compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high value of nutrition there,
but I'm not saying that there's biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I've learned over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times, worked with
clients all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with people that's,
oh my God, I make the best compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old hippies that have been around for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked with dairy farmers, horse farmers,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, the one piece that
they're all missing is the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology takes perhaps a year or two to
come back into that pile after it's gone
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic to a point where it would get
into the realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting close to the realm of what I
would call a biological inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy on the farm who's through his
yard scraps and his vegetable scraps,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not his meat, because he doesn't
want to attract the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into his pile and turned it or left it
static.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Static just takes longer for it to break
down, but you're going to get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: biological compost from static versus
turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every time you turn that pile,
every time you expose those microbes to
[SPEAKER_00]: UV, to oxidation through exposure to air,
you're knocking them way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically pushing them into a cyst
form or into a form where they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed by other biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've turned them into a biostimulant,
which is basically what happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophytes in a mesophilic phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being consumed by other bacteria
and protozoa and converted into what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call a biotic bank account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there and it will be available when
the time is appropriate for the next level
[SPEAKER_00]: of bacteria to be consumed and released in
plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically banking a biostimulant in
a situation like that, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: producing biological compost per se,
if I was clear on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This compost that we're talking about that
is finished and it is stable, how are we
[SPEAKER_02]: going to... We can use that in all the
ways that we normally think about compost
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a top dress, as a soil amendment,
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike the other ones that we've talked
about so far that have got limitations
[SPEAKER_02]: because they've never become stable,
this is the first one in the list where we
[SPEAKER_02]: can feel pretty safe doing whatever we
want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your hand in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pile it up and feel if it starts to heat
up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it heats up, then you're still in what
we would consider decomposition phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't heat up or you stick your
hand in there and it feels a little cool
[SPEAKER_00]: to you, then you know you've got a stable
or organic matter.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to introduce that at some point in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of calling it compost,
we need to call it those terms that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to you about, like ground up
organic matter, gom, pom, particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, or moam, mineral
associated organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now you're getting into that point
where it's in a phase of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts with soil and plant
growing and then breaks back down into
[SPEAKER_00]: soil eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since you pointed out at the
beginning that compost is really a process
[SPEAKER_02]: and not a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need new vocabulary words for
these various products that we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about because people say, oh, my compost,
your compost, and really people are
[SPEAKER_02]: comparing very different things because
they're not all at the same maturity
[SPEAKER_02]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we did a compost cup out here a year
ago, the Vitura County Compost Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought in all of the local compost
producers, everything from the family
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener to these big companies that make
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These experts, these are heavy hitters
that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 10 judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a soil scientist from Rodale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others were business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produced large scale amount volumes
of compost all the way down to guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: make what I would consider moam,
mineral or associated organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them all out on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent three days prior to this
microscoping every sample to see which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones would I consider biologically
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had these 10 judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not one of them because I was biased
because I already looked at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had them analyze it and vote on each
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had vermicompost, we had food waste
compost, we had thermophilic compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had static compost, we had yard waste
compost, and you name it, horse manure
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them looked at the samples and
then voted based on appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one person out of those 10 judges
actually sniffed it and that was the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was all done and they all voted,
at the end of the competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: I stood up and I said, hey, I really
appreciate you guys taking the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out here and do this, but I want to
point out something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys basically determined the value of
the compost on appearance only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone kind of looked around at each
other like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we qualifying or quantifying why
this one's better than that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: By appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I point out, hey, we did no testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea which one's nutritional
and which one's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which ones could potentially
have high salt or heavy metals like the
[SPEAKER_00]: horse manure compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common to have high aluminum in horse
manure as well as high salts, sodiums,
[SPEAKER_00]: both detrimental to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I biologically scoped all of these,
but that wasn't even taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration as to, again, stating that
this was better than the other ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room just exploded inside
conversations at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was like, oh my God,
I never thought about it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really eye-opening to basically put
that level of experience in a room
[SPEAKER_00]: together and turn them on their heads
because they basically had no real
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence to determine which was better
than the other ones except for visually.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to our next category.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one, I just put it in its own
category because I really just thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that worm castings were just a part of all
compost and that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then folks might recall Chandler from
Wormies who was on the show a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was kind enough to send me out a bag of
the Wormies vermicompost that they make so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could see what a vermicompost was
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's unlike anything else that I
would call compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems more uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems a little bit heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, something that's called compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you were talking about the
pass-through worm bins earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff that comes out at the bottom,
which is the worm casting, so their poop,
[SPEAKER_02]: with whatever kind of soil or hay that
might have been thrown in there to even it
[SPEAKER_02]: out and make it a pleasant living
environment, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff, while called compost,
is really its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody gives you vermicompost and it's
vastly worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what the attributes of
that compost would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are doing vermicompost at scale,
you have to start with bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just throw food in a bin and
throw some worms in there because they
[SPEAKER_00]: won't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing will go anaerobic and the
worms will turn to slime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create a bedding that the
worms can retreat to to do their thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's breed or rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an area for them to work through to
get their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to live in decomposing
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to live in their bedding,
but they want to be able to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you for observing the weight
of it because that's really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why vermicompost is so unlike other
forms of compost because it's pushing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the moam, the mineral-associated organic
matter side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mineral-associated organic matter is
highly stable long-term in soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: provides great benefit to helping the soil
food web to begin to build micro and macro
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates, which is important for soil
health, but I'm not going to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is vermicompost so much different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those worms have chewed through that
material consuming bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pooping out nutrients,
highly nutrient-dense little poops because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really there to eat the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really want to eat the
nutrients per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will help move those nutrients
throughout the entire worm bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, again, mutually beneficial
because now you're getting an even amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients throughout the worm bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like this pocket is going to be
heavily laden with this nutrient or that
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pushed through the whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings are very special because
they are very nutrient-dense and highly
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if you put those worm
castings into or top dress and then apply
[SPEAKER_00]: a really good compost extract,
a biologically rich compost extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things will be broken down extremely
fast and stored in the biology so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is really important to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, if you just take raw nutrient
like a secondary tertiary metabolite and
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it on the soil and it rains,
that stuff's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get washed through and down
into the lower soil systems where it's no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer going to be as available for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost your minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so important to have that
biology on high numbers so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: consume those secondary and tertiary
metabolites, store them in their biota,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their body so that now when it rains,
they're stuck to their biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time that stuff, that nutrient in
that bacteria is going to go somewhere is
[SPEAKER_00]: when that bacteria is consumed by a
protozoa or starved to death by a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: exudate and becomes available to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why worm castings are just so
special is because they are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary and tertiary metabolites ready
to be consumed by a biology which will
[SPEAKER_00]: then store it as a nutrient bank system
for when the plant wants them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's totally special stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I coped to this when we did the making
friends with worm episode, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four back with Chandler.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm honestly new to worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make sure that I've got worms in my
pots, but mostly I would just have always
[SPEAKER_02]: thought about them aerating the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until we talked with Chandler
that I realized that they are these super
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient processing machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biological machines that are just taking
this biology that's not super accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: to us or our plants and running it through
their bodies and pooping out the other end
[SPEAKER_02]: something that is rich and valuable to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the fifth category now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're down to our last two here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fifth one, I'm not sure if it totally
fits in this group, but since this is
[SPEAKER_02]: where my curiosity started for this
episode today, I definitely want to
[SPEAKER_02]: include it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last, I don't know, five or six
years, I have been using both of the
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea making products from Green
Bicycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Jodry turned me onto this stuff one
day when I was visiting Wonderland Nursery
[SPEAKER_02]: because Patrick, the founder of Green
Bicycles, had come by and he had this huge
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 gallon container of this what looked
like powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin says, I swear by this stuff,
it makes great compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have and I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got great results and I've been using it
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff from Green Bicycles though is
very unlike the other stuff that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about so far today because the
Green Bicycles products is not like food
[SPEAKER_02]: refutes or lawn clippings or cuttings from
my cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a blend of what I think of more as
soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's guano and feather meal and crab
shell and the kinds of stuff that we all
[SPEAKER_02]: in the regenerative scene are known to use
to build our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got two versions of the product,
one of it with molasses that's dried in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and then one that's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one without the molasses is kind of
seen more as a soil amendment and the one
[SPEAKER_02]: with molasses is used more as a compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using this stuff for years but
it wasn't until, again, I started
[SPEAKER_02]: following The Wormy's Instagram and
Chandler's Instagram, I think it's Jet
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardens, that I really started realizing
that the stuff I was making compost tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: air quotes out of, it didn't look like
compost to me anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bunch of amendments with
molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always take that and put that in
my bubbler that I got from Tea Lab and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll bubble up and it makes this
beautiful compost tea that smells great
[SPEAKER_02]: and my plants have done well on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, I'm like, where's the
biology part of it and is this its own
[SPEAKER_02]: category, which I have just started
calling a nutrient tea, which that
[SPEAKER_02]: category may or may not exist,
but I'm on my own path.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came across it my own and everybody
else probably already knows about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been using this and so A,
I know it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: B, I love the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But C, I don't know if bubbling it is
actually doing me any good because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think that there's any living biology but
there's gotta be biology that assisted up
[SPEAKER_02]: that was on the feather meal, on the crab
shell, contained in the bat guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like assisted up sleeping
biology in there, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go ahead and fire it up and
then I get nutrition with, I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_02]: some amount of biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please speak to that, which is a very
different, it's a very different product
[SPEAKER_02]: to put in the same bucket as compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really feel like it's got its own
personality and I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: resolve it with the rest of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it definitely has a personality and I
appreciate the term nutrient solution or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient tea would be the appropriate way
to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big difference between compost extract
and teas versus a nutrient tea would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of humic acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are biological super foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's like a one stop shop for
your entire soil food web by using these
[SPEAKER_00]: compost extracts that are very high in
humic or fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, now we've separated
these two by that one critical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the two different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: One with molasses, one without molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tend to believe the one with
molasses would be working a lot quicker,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a short term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the one without molasses would be
more of a long term nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that I mean that when you apply
that nutrient solution onto the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're assuming that that solution is
going to be absorbed by the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter and then slowly released by
the bacteria that are mining it and
[SPEAKER_00]: storing it in themselves and then they
become available to the protozoa which
[SPEAKER_00]: pooped out to the plant, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one is a short term, one is a long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short term one with the molasses is
going to stimulate all kinds of microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know for sure that the bacteria just
love molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago it got explained to me and I
forget what it is, but it has something to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the fact that the sugar has only
been processed to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been refined yet and that's why
the bacteria love it so much because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's again the secondary tertiary
metabolites haven't been refined to a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where they're more difficult to
break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have biofilms built up
on all of those nutrient inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just recently NASA came back with an
article about how they had slapped some
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm on the outside of the space
station three years ago and they scraped
[SPEAKER_00]: it this year and brought it inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it was still alive even though it
had been living in space which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how could anything live in
space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it goes to show that biology is
incredibly resilient, but it also goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: show that the biofilm is so powerful that
it can protect those organisms pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: in any environment you can possibly come
up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point I tend to believe that we
will find that perhaps life even exists in
[SPEAKER_00]: flames, that there's some kind of biology
that we haven't quite uncovered yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a whole different meaning
for the Shaping Fire podcast name,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get there someday, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, to stay on topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, yes, when you add the
dry molasses and you put it in water and
[SPEAKER_00]: you bubble it, you're going to get a
bacterial explosion, a plume, for lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: better words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be pluming out the
organisms that were consuming,
[SPEAKER_00]: that had created their biofilm and their
protection, their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: On those individual nutrients,
whether it's crab meal, horse,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, feather meal, crab meal,
calcium, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will have bacteria that
specifically mine those components and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you've grown them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pour them on your soil,
you're going to have an explosion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology that has that nutrient stored up
in its pantry that is now going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed by the protozoa and nematodes
that you have present in your soil system
[SPEAKER_00]: or the microorthopods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worms, don't forget about them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're all working together to
release this nutrients back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I would say to this
green bicycle nutrient solution is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an amendment, but yes, it does have
some biological constituents that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available on those nutrients that mine
those specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very targeted biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started with it just because Kevin
Jodry said so, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I trusted his opinion and it's worked
for me for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny that now, like whatever,
five, six years later, now I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to the point that I can even think
about more what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it works for me even without
knowing exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that kind of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to clean up, before we go on to the
next topic, I want to clean up a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: the things that I got wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Wormy's Instagram is obviously easy
because you know how to spell Wormy's,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Chandler Michalski, who was a guest
for the, you know, getting friendly with
[SPEAKER_02]: worms, shaping fire episode like three
back, I got his Instagram wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually Jethouse Gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so nothing worse than you plug
somebody whose Instagram is very
[SPEAKER_02]: educational for you and then you plug it
wrong, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't want to interrupt you,
but I was going to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to, you know, I want to do
Chandler Solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to clean that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then anybody who is interested in
looking at that Green Bicycles products,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of weird because green is
actually spelled G-R-E-A-N.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, you know, that's tricksy
and will totally destroy your Google
[SPEAKER_02]: results without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two products that, I mean,
it's their only two products, but it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: two ones that I've used all these years is
the Happy Endings Compost Tea Mix and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ocean Bounty Flowering Mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for anybody who wants to look into that
and you can get that stuff on Amazon and
[SPEAKER_02]: their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving right along.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're coming up here to the end of this
like huge first set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the compost we're going to talk about
next, number six.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually going to set us up for
set two because we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: this variety of compost during most of,
probably all of set two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just set us up there, Layton,
and then I'll take us to commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sixth category is the stuff that
you sent me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a problem in my, you know,
I know you're a compost expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: You consult for all these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got this crazy ass lab in your garage
and another one in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know you're like mad scientist
compost guy, but like I had not actually
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen like what you make, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've always appreciated you for our
friendship and conversation, but I never
[SPEAKER_02]: seen any of your compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had a fungus snap problem,
which we'll talk more about in the third
[SPEAKER_02]: set, but you're all like, hey man,
let me send you something to fix that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shipped me up two different bags
of this compost, which was unlike any
[SPEAKER_02]: other compost that I had ever come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, small granular and it
was rich and it smelled so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it like, I mean not to sound too woo
woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I felt it alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I was getting vibes off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I opened it, like I was,
you know, I got like a hit of the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, whoa, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very unlike anything else that I
have been given as compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you told me to just,
you know, I think you had me brew it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I put it on and it caused all of this
like immediate biological change,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we're going to talk about more in
set two, but this, after talking to you
[SPEAKER_02]: more about it, you explained to me why
this kind of compost is in a category all
[SPEAKER_02]: of its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please explain what's different about
this category of compost that I had never
[SPEAKER_02]: even considered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then set us up and then I'll take us
to commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get into the process in the next
set, but bottom line is it's a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foundation of it is palm, so
particulate organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you noticed that really fine
particulate, but you also noticed it was
[SPEAKER_00]: super fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key to this, that
fluffiness allows for gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for heavy colonization of,
you know, very, very diverse biology in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that does not force competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody's fighting for the same
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just there in suspension,
just to be woken up and by you,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're brewing them or top
dressing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's, look at it like
condominiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building, you know, every one of those
tiny little particulate is a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: condominium, a city full of all different
types of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are there basically just waiting to
be provided with the environment that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can really, you know, expand it and thrive
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into the ingredients and the
process in the next set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit the key thing for me though,
which is the fact that it's not a thermal
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most ways, it would be considered
immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it would be considered
immature is because when I take this start
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which is the biological compost
that I made, non-thermophilic,
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it cold composting, I screen it
numerous times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm screening out the big stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using forces to break off all of the
organisms, the hemicrophobic acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: break down the little pieces that tend to
be clumped together or sheared off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger piece of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's those mechanical processes and
then the screening that allows me to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that poem, those fine little particulates,
and suspend them in a solution so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be colonized by all the different
diverse bacteria and biology that I've put
[SPEAKER_00]: into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this idea that it's a cold compost,
I haven't heard that term before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we talked about this
earlier in the week, it was interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: because you said, you know, all of the
other compost, all right, probably not the
[SPEAKER_02]: vermiculture, but most of the other
compost that we have talked about today,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have all been heated to like,
what, 165 or something, because people are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to, you know, kill the seeds and,
you know, make it a little more inert.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, that's also killing all the
microbes, which is really what so many of
[SPEAKER_02]: us natural farmers are chasing after.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really astonished me that,
you know, to realize that I'm always
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about using my compost teas
because I want to pour microbes into my
[SPEAKER_02]: soil to help buoy the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, if it's a thermal compost,
it means that like that stuff's like
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly been wiped out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus this cold compost, where even
though we'll talk more about this in a
[SPEAKER_02]: second, it sounds like it's dangerous
because it's all like wild in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I imagine I'm doing with a
thermal compost tea really is happening at
[SPEAKER_02]: a much smaller level than if I were to use
a cold compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing you're missing too is
the most important reason to go
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic is to kill pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so they kill weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a byproduct of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is to knock back all of the
potential pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a lot of compost is based on
manures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: High-end anaerobic digestion, which is the
other piece that we did talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thermophilic component is to
basically provide the same thing as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're killing everything and then
starting over, starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that's why I went to cold
composting was because I could not get the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological diversity that I was looking
for when I went thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't use any manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use any food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use purely vegan compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we will dig into that even
more for set two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're still with us, I appreciate
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a solid hour first set,
which is the longest first set I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: had.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I care very much about this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no way that I wanted to do
this topic in short shrift, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if we're gonna do it, let's fricking
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're still here with us and
you're caring about all this, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're our kind of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate that you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna go ahead and take a short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is soil biologist,
Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please do support them and let them
know you heard about them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Leighton Morrison, and I'll see you
next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dinomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinomyco.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dinomyco.com
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any

pots or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_02]: tired soil, choose Dinomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_02]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Copert has the beneficial insects,
mites and nematodes, microbials,
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky cards and air distribution units
you need to partner with nature to defend
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los and my guest today
[SPEAKER_02]: is soil biologist, Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are at set two.
[SPEAKER_02]: During set one we looked at a wide variety
of the things that we come in contact with
[SPEAKER_02]: that is labeled compost and we did our
best to make sense of them and we found
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves at the end with you know
focusing on the kind of compost that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that I'm usually looking for you
know you know much of the other types that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the curated compost and the
vermiculture compost and the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: compost like like all of that stuff is are
things that I use in my garden but most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the time myself as a natural farmer
interested in regenerative you know
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation and feeding the rhizosphere
I'm really wanting to you know feed and
[SPEAKER_02]: add microbe life I want to add biology and
so we ended the first set talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: cold compost that have not been heated
where all the biology is still alive and
[SPEAKER_02]: so in this set we're going to talk a bit
about the difference between that and the
[SPEAKER_02]: other composts and the biology and also
I'm very interested in you know if one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the reasons we heat thermal compost is get
rid of the pathogens that makes this
[SPEAKER_02]: unheated microbe inoculate this cold
compost sound like wild like the wild west
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's start with the difference you
know you have spoken on this on this show
[SPEAKER_02]: before briefly about the difference
between soil science and soil biology and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I my you know back of the
envelope is just like soil sciences
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and minerals and soil biology is
living stuff but but honestly we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: gone into it you know in depth so far so I
could I could have it wrong so so why
[SPEAKER_02]: don't we start there and then we can start
to hang the rest of the conversation on
[SPEAKER_00]: that Leighton all right that sounds good
and you know thank you again shango for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this because you were we're having a
conversation that has needed to happen for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years now about you know whether it's
a compost is should be called compost or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's needs other names and and you
know just recently in the last couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years I've seen you know like particulate
organic matter and mineral associated
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter come about as as words that
are provide value and and this next part
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also equally as important is is
the understanding that soil is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: three components it is the physical sand
so clay and organic matter and their
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship which is very important
second is soil chemistry and third is soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology soil science base everything on
two of those three pieces which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical and the chemical and this is due
to economic based systems and like in like
[SPEAKER_02]: human reductionism right we always we
always value life last right seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I go really seems to be the way
especially if you look at where we are as
[SPEAKER_00]: a species at this point in time we won't
go there all right but basically soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science is is chemistry heavy everything
has been based on building fertilizers to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow more crops to feed more people
regardless of nutritional value which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes no sense to me the only real way to
achieve achieve nutrient dense food is
[SPEAKER_00]: through biology it's that critical
biogeochemical interactions that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to pull up these nutrients and
and and regulate itself as to what it
[SPEAKER_00]: wants instead of being force-fed and PK so
that is why there's this huge disconnect
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil science versus soil biology until
dr. Lane Ingham made the world aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is life under their feet people
didn't even consider soil biology as as a
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing and so in many ways she's
pioneered the eye-opening of of the masses
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fact that there is more going on in
the soil than just physical and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's this critical bridge called
biological that allows the chemistry to
[SPEAKER_00]: flow in and out of the physical components
and into the plant directly so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an important conversation needs to
happen is that you know the soil science
[SPEAKER_00]: world has got to knock down the ivory
towers of just chemistry and really start
[SPEAKER_00]: to open up to this interdisciplinary mode
of operation that will unlock these really
[SPEAKER_00]: important secrets I sent you a paper
recently which I'm sure you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy reading time and time again because
there's just so much information in that
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically kind of explains that this
this organic matter we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it compost anymore it's organic
matter it's just in different phases of
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition provide this incredibly
powerful home city globe consider it a
[SPEAKER_00]: planet that that aggregate is a planet and
inside that planet is all of this magic
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on that that's protecting
itself it's evolving it's it's producing
[SPEAKER_00]: more inoculant for for more expansion for
for better soil structure to to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture the more moisture that goes in
that gets held in those aggregates the
[SPEAKER_00]: more densely populated they can become the
more they can clean the water the more
[SPEAKER_00]: they can provide foods for other organisms
so it's really that the foundation of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is that biogeochemical
processes that are occurring within inside
[SPEAKER_00]: that aggregate now is that aggregate poem
or mom well that's the thing is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get into mineral associated organic matter
you get into a environment where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted now you're you're you don't have
the gas or air exchange I should say you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the co2 leaving and the oxygen
or the air atmospheric air coming down you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the the same ability to to
aggregate that's why it's so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable than poem so I'm sorry I got way
off track there I think I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to really differentiate the
difference between these phases of
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposition sure I'll bring you back in
but but since you mentioned the paper that
[SPEAKER_02]: you sent me yesterday we might as well
plug it and I will also have a link to it
[SPEAKER_02]: on the page for this episode on the
shaping fire website but the but the but
[SPEAKER_02]: the the the science paper which was a
fantastic read last night is called will
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi solve the carbon dilemma and it's by
s Amelia Hanula and Ellie Morian anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's it's a fascinating read and and
we'll be talking more about the the fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of this paper you know towards
towards the latter half of this set but
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're saying Layton is is spelled
out very specifically they're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about having an increase in soil biology
especially with fungal heavy compost
[SPEAKER_02]: creating all of these soil opportunities
that are not available to the soil when
[SPEAKER_02]: not using biologically and fungally active
agricultural soils so so anyway that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the paper and so we'll get back on
topic here so so we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between the soil science and
the soil biology and and how most of most
[SPEAKER_02]: of compost and and everything is looking
at that the chemistry and the physicality
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil and not the biology I would
like you to speak to this idea of the the
[SPEAKER_02]: the the variety of biology right because
NPK is so reductionist and and and most of
[SPEAKER_02]: us in cannabis were were brought up
thinking you know hit our NPK numbers feed
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant or you know if we came from the
bottle forced feed the plant and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we are trying to tease out is
that you know the compost which is is is
[SPEAKER_02]: the central the focus of our topic we want
it to be as biologically active as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and and the way for us to do that
is to not cook it like a thermal compost
[SPEAKER_02]: so I would like you to speak to what that
process is like to produce a compost that
[SPEAKER_02]: has not been cooked because creating a
cooked thermal compost is the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have ever heard of so again let's
not call it compost organic matter right
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic matter is probably the largest
source of nutritional holding capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: this is where biology meets chemistry so
most people understand what a cation
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange site is or cation exchange
capacity so that capacity is the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: for nutrients solution to be held on the
bond site so that it's not mobile and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore safe and secure for later
harvest by the plant and the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: alright so that's that's really important
to understand so that being said trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: reel it back into understanding the
thermophilic process of breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter I think that the best the
best way to approach it is is to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that when you get over a
hundred and twenty degrees you are losing
[SPEAKER_00]: biological diversity when you hit a
hundred and thirty degrees you have lost
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much everything it's now just
thermal fights that are living in that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter or on that organic matter I
should say so that's why if your goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve a biological compost you have
to be below a hundred and twenty degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: now back in the day when I was studying
under a lane there was always this issue
[SPEAKER_00]: of well you know you can bring in
pathogens and you can cause you know plant
[SPEAKER_00]: problems you know deficiencies and and all
these other things because you've brought
[SPEAKER_00]: something in from somewhere else and
you've applied it perhaps inappropriately
[SPEAKER_00]: onto into this pot or onto this plant and
my arguments always been that diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: will out compete reductionist so if I've
reduced this down to just thermal fights
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential for a pathogenic outbreak is
way greater than if I had a very
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically diverse compost system this
was one of many conversations that Elaine
[SPEAKER_00]: and I agreed to disagree about was the
fact that for her she has a an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation celebrity status so she has to
be very guarded about what she says
[SPEAKER_00]: because people will inappropriately be
morons and and use more because a little
[SPEAKER_00]: is good oh more is better well that's how
you get into these problems with pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination with deficient
nutrient deficient issues because what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is you you created a newt lock or
you've created a pathogenic inoculation so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why it's critical that she
maintains that the only way to make safe
[SPEAKER_00]: compost is to do it thermophilically and I
agree with her because humans are just
[SPEAKER_00]: humans they they tend to do stuff without
really thinking first and and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that they are crossing the T's
and dotting the I's responsibly it tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to be oh whatever is easy and quickest for
me is what I'm going to do and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate approach when you're
dealing with these critical types of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological exposures there's there's some
composts that I've made that are are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely potentially very dangerous to
play with because if I have underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: health issues and I'm playing with
Pseudomonas bacteria the potential for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually make myself very sick is is is
real I think that in many ways I've I've
[SPEAKER_00]: benefited from my work playing with
anaerobic fish manure because I early on
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting exposed to this stuff and like
you said earlier what if you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on you it's days before you don't
stink anymore so there's there's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: some serious issues to it and but I
learned very quickly I never got violently
[SPEAKER_00]: sick I definitely you know had some
stomach issues you know early on when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was playing with this stuff because I
didn't completely understand about the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between anaerobic digestion and
and aerobic aerobic microbes versus
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic microbes and and the potential
for them to make us very sick so that
[SPEAKER_00]: being said let's let's delve into what is
a cold compost versus a thermophilic in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cold composting situation the sweet spot
for massive protozoa production and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason I'm using protozoa is because
they're the ones that are doing all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of nutrient cycling in other
words the nutrient cycling is that this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria has all this good stuff locked up
in it including nitrogen and this protozoa
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to eat that bacteria because it
wants the carbon to make itself grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: get bigger doesn't want the nitrogen
doesn't care about what's in the pantry of
[SPEAKER_00]: that bacteria so it consumes that and it
poops out pure nitrogen and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other elements in a plant available form
and that's critical in pretty much all
[SPEAKER_00]: soil systems that I look at the number one
issue is the lack of protozoa that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the flagellates and the amoeba those
are the aerobic ones the anaerobic ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are the ciliates and then you get some
facultatives which we're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that it's just too deep but bottom
line is the sweet spot is 85 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% moisture content so when you squeeze
the stuff you will get water drops forming
[SPEAKER_00]: in between your fingers that tells you
that it's above 50% if you get no moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: you're about 50% if you get drops now
you're pushing into the 60 70 and 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture that's the sweet spot for
protozoan production it is also generally
[SPEAKER_00]: a sweet spot for what I want to call
fungal sporulation and germination in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil system itself plants don't like it
that humid or that that much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture that's when you get into root
rots and you get into other disease
[SPEAKER_00]: causing potential pathogens whereas in a
compost pile it's a different animal now
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not dealing with plant life yet
we're just dealing with protozoan
[SPEAKER_00]: production and when I'm applying this well
I probably need to go through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of how I do it so I'm taking these vegan
compost so it's just plants no manures
[SPEAKER_00]: greens and browns the ratio is is always
66% browns 33 and a half percent greens
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are using a tremendous amount of
water to to get that to begin what I call
[SPEAKER_00]: the thermophilic rye we never want to get
to the thermophilic process that's 130
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to keep it below 120 I generally
tell people keep it below 115 if I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: 115 I got to flip it as a matter of fact I
got to flip a pile this afternoon because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 115 right now that being said I'll
let the temperature go up to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point 115 is max and then I flip it if it
doesn't get to 115 then I never flip it I
[SPEAKER_00]: just let it do its thing and I watch it
until it starts to come down not quite to
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient ambient would be the the
temperature outside environment so today
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 75 is always in sunny so when it's 75
degrees and I know it's gone through the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological process or the thermophilic
rise that never got to thermophilic phase
[SPEAKER_00]: so I brought it up but I kept it in the
mesophilic now that's considered immature
[SPEAKER_00]: compost because it's not really well
broken down so how do I break it down at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point that's where I get into these
mechanical forces I use agitation aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: vibration spin so gravity all of these
things to to get that immature compost to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the the things that I'm looking
for which is the biology and and the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest bits poem particulate organic
matter that I can get through that process
[SPEAKER_00]: and then whatever's left goes right back
into the compost pile again so are you are
[SPEAKER_02]: you describing mechanical processes that
you submit the immature the immature
[SPEAKER_02]: organic material to that replaces what is
normally done by breaking down with
[SPEAKER_00]: thermals or time or time right you can you
can stack up a pile of chips or any
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter for that matter matter any
organic matter for that matter and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: go through a decomposition phase whether
it gets hot whether it goes thermophilic
[SPEAKER_00]: or not it doesn't matter I mean I don't
know about you but growing up in New
[SPEAKER_00]: England we had to rake leaves every fall
and we would take those leaves and dump
[SPEAKER_00]: them over at the edge of the swamp and
that pile would be like five feet tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: me and my sisters would jump in it we'd
have a blast throwing leaves and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: running down the hill and fast as we can
trying to dive into the pile but come
[SPEAKER_00]: spring that pile was gone it was just this
low lump of what was left of we call it
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf mold nowadays but just what was left
of all those leaves so that went through a
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown process but it never got hot it
never we never saw those piles steaming so
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no major heat exchange but there
was definitely some minor heat exchange in
[SPEAKER_02]: order for that to break down when you add
the water the the the 85 degrees and 70%
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture that's a that's a lot of moisture
is the water involved because it's there
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep the temperature from spiking I
think you called it a thermophilic rise
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not very familiar with that I'd like
to know what happens during the
[SPEAKER_02]: thermophilic rise and what's what's like
why why so much water so the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: broken into H2O all right so we have
oxygen and we have hydrogen there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of bacterial constituents that thrive
on hydrogen so they consume hydrogen as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel source to break apart the nitrogen
and the organic organic matter or the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon off of the organic matter all right
so there are also other forms of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that consume the oxygen to do their part
in breaking the nitrogen and the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: off of each other does that make sense
yeah it does so water is the food water is
[SPEAKER_00]: life right there's no joke to that water
is life without it nothing ceases to exist
[SPEAKER_00]: so that water is just a fuel source it has
nothing to do with with with regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures not we're not putting out the
fire we're just providing a food source
[SPEAKER_00]: for the biology to do their part in
breaking the nitrogen and the carbon off
[SPEAKER_02]: of each other and so let's see I'm gonna
try to do a summarization to this point so
[SPEAKER_02]: so what we're trying to do with the cold
compost is that we are going to a use only
[SPEAKER_02]: plant matter so we don't have to worry as
much about pathogens like E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli and then we're not gonna let the
temperature go above 85 degrees but
[SPEAKER_02]: especially 120 but 85 is really our goal
so that the the pile gets warm naturally
[SPEAKER_02]: from the breaking down but it doesn't get
hot enough to kill our microbes off and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can get away with that because we're only
using plant material instead of animal
[SPEAKER_02]: material which can cause the pathogens and
and then we are also going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical processes to this organic
material that will further break it down
[SPEAKER_02]: to create more of these biological
opportunities in the soil for life which
[SPEAKER_02]: also breaks down the compost in ways some
of them some of the ways that we would get
[SPEAKER_02]: from a thermal version as well so we're
we're choosing to not use the heat of a
[SPEAKER_02]: thermophilic compost and instead we are
using a safer inputs and also massaging
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil in ways that opens up
opportunities and so we have what is
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially yes a riskier or I love what
you said earlier a dangerous compost but
[SPEAKER_02]: we have decreased that risk by not using
animal products in there and we are making
[SPEAKER_02]: it more diverse and more effective by
doing some of these mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations to yes and I think the other
thing is that you missed his seats right
[SPEAKER_00]: when I when I harvest greens and browns
and I harvest greens and browns I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest plants that have gone to seed
because I don't want the seed in my
[SPEAKER_00]: compost what I want is flowers but I don't
want the seed pods so that's another piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of this that's important and the other one
which we're missing on is diversity like I
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect like every type of green I can
find every type of brown I can find and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I use those proportionally volume not
by weight to make my pile and the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so important to get the diversity is
because of endophytic biology it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit deep but we got to go there all
right so the endophytes that live inside
[SPEAKER_02]: those green leaves and luckily we just did
the Jeff Loewenfels show on bacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: endophytes so anybody who just listened to
that show is already going to be up to
[SPEAKER_02]: speed on this so so folks who want to hear
more about this go back and listen to the
[SPEAKER_02]: show about the new Jeff Loewenfels book
with that please continue all right so but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's both endophytic bacteria and
there's endophytic fungi that live inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant itself so when that leaf is fall
comes and it dries out and falls to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground if it lands on the ground it's
going to release sap robes that's a type
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungi that decomposes organic matter
but it's also going to release decomposing
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria say it lands in the water well
it's now going to become aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms now you've heard me talk
about the great mass migrations before the
[SPEAKER_00]: great human expansions and this here again
is a subject that is somewhat debating or
[SPEAKER_00]: debatable that that there is microbes that
live can live both terrestrial and aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a firm believer of it but there's
plenty of people out there that would say
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm batshit crazy on this but that being
said I have proven it to myself many many
[SPEAKER_00]: times in the products that I've done one
of the key things that I focus on is
[SPEAKER_00]: diatoms those are specific organism that
lives generally speaking in aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and it produces or they
produce oxygen via two different sources
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why they're so powerful one is
through photosynthesis and the other is
[SPEAKER_00]: through consuming biology consuming
bacteria consuming nutrients that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water system and then using their own
internal biological factories to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient out of the water and build their
shells and build build their I should say
[SPEAKER_00]: divide and continue to expand as a
population so I've applied I've applied
[SPEAKER_00]: diatom based what's one of my ingredients
it's called fish brew for lack of better
[SPEAKER_00]: ways it just let's get right after it so
fish brew the the farm on Cape Cod has
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater diatoms like I've never seen
before and I got so excited when I found
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff because diatoms are a great
indicator like you I can apply diatoms to
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil and I can come back next year
the year after the year after year after
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll be able to find them if they're
healthy they will have a chloroplast and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the their nucleus and their other
you know oregano's if they're not healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're dead they're just an empty
shell made of silica and silica has a
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency to last quite a while in the soil
so there's a great indication that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: take aquatic organisms and put them in a
terrestrial environment and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: survive so that being said when I take my
low temp compost and I throw it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where I'm using agitation
centrifugal force aeration soft collision
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm breaking off all of these pieces
of of what I want to call pre-digested
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter so it's in the digestion
process but it hasn't been completely
[SPEAKER_00]: digested into like a palm or a mom if
there's still very much a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that has not gone through any kind
of decomposition so now I've I've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've I've I've banged it against each
other I've pulled off all of the little
[SPEAKER_00]: bits that have decomposed and I've I've
done this in a in an aqueous environment
[SPEAKER_00]: with fish brew and and some worm castings
so now all of a sudden I have all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: suspended stuff in the water column it
looks like chocolate water so it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: very rich with hemic acids which we've
talked about as as the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: superfood I've introduced all these
microbes from from fish brew which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible if you look at the the DNA
sequences of what they've done now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called meadow meadow barcoding where
you're getting a general idea of who's
[SPEAKER_00]: present or who's been there which gets
deeper into horizontal gene transfer which
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't go there today but that being
said is now I have all of this diversity I
[SPEAKER_00]: have all the endophytes from from the
decomposed organic matter I have all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these biological constituents that came in
on the fish brew and then I have all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these secondary and tertiary metabolites
from the digestion of the worms that is
[SPEAKER_00]: called worm castings so this in many ways
you know when I started this journey I had
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea what the fuck I was doing but now
14 15 years later I'm really seeing like
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like what do you call intuition
instinct drove me down that path of well
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone talks about how great worm
castings are I should add some of those oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how good fish manure is because
every time I play with it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately aerobically stabilize it and
I pour it on plants many of those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: explode and I also know the value of
compost and and the fact that it brings in
[SPEAKER_00]: these these superfoods like humic and
fulvic acids as well as all these
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary and tertiary metabolites that
that are happening during the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition phase so BAM there's a
there's a grand slam home run for you by
[SPEAKER_00]: adding all these things together using
mechanical forces to separate them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then using what I call dewatering
techniques which is through vibration
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrating the organic matter to shed all
of the liquid off of it now I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological super sauce secret sauce
whatever you want to call it now if I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make that shelf stable then I have to
press it so I take the dewatering to
[SPEAKER_00]: another level and then I take that and
fluff it up and that's what you got was
[SPEAKER_00]: was that poem inoculated poem that's easy
to work with just put it in a glass of
[SPEAKER_00]: water stir it up as a matter of fact on
the podcast a couple weeks back I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: drank some I put some 11 year old product
in a glass of water stirred it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: drank it on camera because I've been
telling people that I eat this shit all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time every time I work with it I get
it in my mouth my ears it's always my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingernails are always dirty so I'm just
constantly being inoculated with this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so I proved that hey it's not going
to hurt you it's actually really super
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to your your entire digestive
tract because you're putting in microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't there or weren't there haven't
been there for a long time that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: again all these crazy biogeochemical
reactions that we have only begun to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss because science is moving into an
interdisciplinary mode because the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction aside of it has realized we
can't just keep reducing everything down
[SPEAKER_00]: to nothing and then not talk to anybody
about how does this affect their work or
[SPEAKER_00]: how does this affect that process or so
it's an interesting time to be alive as
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are happening but we don't
have the technology yet to really delve
[SPEAKER_00]: down what those processes are why they're
so important and how they are affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything around them so again if if you
don't have the technology but you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: know-how well then that's the key to the
whole thing is all right I don't know why
[SPEAKER_00]: it works but I know it does work so I'm
gonna keep doing it and that's good okay
[SPEAKER_02]: so so you know bringing this home a little
bit to like how it can be used by the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator we it sounds like this cold
compost inoculant does all of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we think a thermal compost will do
the you know we we we use a thermal
[SPEAKER_02]: compost as an amendment we use a thermal
compost as a as a top dress we use a
[SPEAKER_02]: thermal compost to make compost tea why do
we do that because we want to add you know
[SPEAKER_02]: life vibrance to our plants but we know
because they've been cooked so hot because
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that's a smart thing to do when
there's pathogens that that it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually not as vibrant with life as as we
would hope it would be in our gardens and
[SPEAKER_02]: so what we've done with this is we have
used a lower temperature and we have
[SPEAKER_02]: gathered our microbes and and protozoa and
other biology we have we've gone through
[SPEAKER_02]: the effort to bring them together from
these three different directions and and
[SPEAKER_02]: we are actually creating a air quotes
compost which is essentially organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter that is actually what we think of
when we think of compost but the common
[SPEAKER_02]: form of compost that we get which is
thermal actually is not supercharged the
[SPEAKER_02]: way we really want it to be and so this
cold organic matter because of the care
[SPEAKER_02]: we've put into it is actually what we
idealize about compost yeah biomimicry
[SPEAKER_00]: right we talk about biomimicry all the
time i've had arguments with people that
[SPEAKER_00]: say there's no such thing as as compost in
nature and i'm like no you're wrong look
[SPEAKER_00]: at every time there's a flood that's all
piled up all the sticks and brush and and
[SPEAKER_00]: algae from the bottom of the river is
piled up and that's float sam that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost pile underneath the forest that's
a compost pile that's just a giant compost
[SPEAKER_00]: pile dead animals dead sticks leaves you
know plants that have come in and gone out
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all creating compost now that
compost doesn't heat up in the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: floor nor does it the float sam the pile
that's you know left by the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: river those don't heat up those those
would be considered cold compost do they
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up to some degree oh i'm sure in the
in the pockets of it when it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: dense and compressed that's going to heat
up but is it going to go thermophilic no
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not it's not going to it's not going
to ever get to a position where it could
[SPEAKER_00]: combust and that is the end of the
thermophilic phase if you let it run wild
[SPEAKER_00]: is combustion is when the microbes start
to produce alcohol and and then and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it can you know self combust so you know
again thermophytes are are important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and and getting your head
wrapped around the fact that you do not
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cross contaminate you do not want
to deal with pathogens you do not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with seeds thermophilic process is a
great way to bypass that potential problem
[SPEAKER_02]: all right so um i want to go back to
talking about the the actual physical
[SPEAKER_02]: structure of good compost uh during the
third set we're gonna we're gonna talk a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more about your actual
manufacturing techniques all these ways
[SPEAKER_02]: that you massage it but um you um you know
you made a special point to talk about um
[SPEAKER_02]: you're breaking the pieces down to a small
size using these other methods that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to talk about but you were very
specific that the reason that you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it is to make these organic matter grains
have lots of housing and community
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities for the microbes and
protozoa and amoeba and other denizens of
[SPEAKER_02]: the rhizosphere right so so talk a little
bit that about that would you about the
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual physical structure of good
compost so this goes back to poem
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate organic matter and moam
mineral associated organic matter mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: associated organic matter is going to be
very dense kind of like um worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: except for even more dense so think of
bulk density how much something weighs by
[SPEAKER_00]: volume um and those weights are going to
be indicators of how long that material
[SPEAKER_00]: that organic matter is going to last in
the soil system as well as how quickly it
[SPEAKER_00]: will release its nutrient so poem will
last two to three months in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: system uh moam will last two to three
years so there's a big difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: last what does last mean so um you throw
um poem down on uh on an orchard and three
[SPEAKER_00]: months it's going to be gone it's going to
be decomposed by all of the biology not
[SPEAKER_00]: the thermophytes but the other decomposers
whether that's fungi or bacteria but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be it's going to go away it's
going to have been used up as a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants that you've applied it to
does that make sense yep i do okay so
[SPEAKER_00]: again the the moam is going to last years
and the poem is going to last months so
[SPEAKER_00]: what that tells me is that if i colonize
that palm and i apply it then what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen is we're going to have a fast
nutrient release within within three
[SPEAKER_00]: months it's all going to be gone it's
going to be consumed and released plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available or at least stored in the in the
biology in the bacteria um whereas moam um
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get that fast release
you're going to get a really really slow
[SPEAKER_00]: release which is good for soil structure
um because you want you want concrete
[SPEAKER_00]: foundations you don't want to build your
your palace on bamboo stilts right but if
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm trying to get uh inoculation i want to
get those microbes that that have set up
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and and in these condominiums on on
this poem then the best way to do it is
[SPEAKER_00]: use the poem because i know it's going to
have released all of that biology into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil relatively quickly and to be honest
with you um moam is so dense the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density is so great that that you again
you don't have the ability for um you know
[SPEAKER_00]: mass colonization it's too dense it
doesn't let the oxygen in to feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that in turn are providing food
sources for the protozoa and it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: complex but i i think i explained it okay
there yeah and so um the do you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have these these small fluffy um you know
granular i guess it's probably the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of them ours and also we don't want
anything like smooth um so it creates all
[SPEAKER_02]: these like small micro hotels for all of
these microbes that is essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: point exactly dude like when remember when
we were smashing up rocks yeah oh god yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: i remember smashing up rocks to make my uh
to make my regen tent with the with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil horizons oh my god yeah so no smooth
surfaces yeah think of it like um if you
[SPEAKER_00]: polish something um it's very difficult
for oxidization for uh you know any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of mechanical um force to to break it down
so that polish is is is protection and and
[SPEAKER_00]: yes you you want porous you want surface
area as much as you possibly can get so
[SPEAKER_00]: things can get into the cracks and set up
shop and then set up their biofilm and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to expand out but they can't do that
on a smooth surface they're they're they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the benefit of of the
protection on three sides they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically exposed on 180 degrees on a
polished surface where if they're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little crack or a crevice there's a very
small exposure to to the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: environment all right that makes sense
especially with the word porous that gives
[SPEAKER_02]: me the picture i'm looking for so um so
the last thing i want to talk about here
[SPEAKER_02]: in set two is um uh what is essentially
the point of the of the paper we referred
[SPEAKER_02]: to earlier which is talking about how you
know in this cold compost that we are
[SPEAKER_02]: creating we want to have there be a
variety of fungals there um and so like of
[SPEAKER_02]: course there is you know you know basic
fungals that that we're all familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: with like mycelium but this paper goes
into uh depth that there is a wide variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of different fungal participants that the
more of them we have the more combination
[SPEAKER_02]: of fungals and bacterias and nutrients it
becomes this kind of wild mix and match
[SPEAKER_02]: where it like a buffet that that um like
everybody can get what they need but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know i've never really heard anybody talk
too much about the variety of of fungals
[SPEAKER_02]: except for like oh do you want to make a
you know bacteria dominant um compost tea
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you want to make a fungal dominant
compost tea that's about as far as i
[SPEAKER_02]: generally hear it so would you please
address um the the fungals in the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: compost uh their importance and um you
know as much as you can tell us like what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing there okay so you hit on a
couple of really important parts um first
[SPEAKER_00]: one is imo right everybody's like imo imo
and imo is the foundation of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming what is imo well i'll be honest
with you it's yeasts it's not saprophytic
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi it's basically the precursor the the
the successionary system that has to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: place in order for sap robes different uh
constituents that in play so in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: build that um foundation or that roadway
so that you can bring in the groups of uh
[SPEAKER_00]: following the successionary groups into
play you need those yeasts you need those
[SPEAKER_00]: um lower successionary fungal uh life
forms i'm going to use that term because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so much we don't know so little
in that paper um they talked about knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: about 0.01 percent about what the fuck is
really going on in these biological when i
[SPEAKER_02]: read that i actually screenshot it and
circled it and sent it to some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: compost friends i'm like do you know we
only know what 0.01 percent of of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes even are like i was astonished to
realize that we know almost nothing about
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in our soil uh-huh and and then
worse yet uh the interactions and those
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions are the key to the whole
thing like like why does a thermophyte
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up why why is why is that getting out
of control why is it because i put so much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in there that if this pile is
going to combust like what is that
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeochemical process that's happening
that's creating so much heat it's it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy um so you know that being said imo
works so great because it's putting all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the foods and and the successionary
species that need to be present for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these older later succession species to
come into play so um in in understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost process in getting a fungally
dominated compost you've got to have those
[SPEAKER_00]: yeasts to to even begin to get the sapro
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in and do their thing and we're
not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that kind of that kind of thing to
happen and it's just not going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to any of these other organisms that are
all working together like a internet
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighway and that white coating on the
outside that is actually a protection
[SPEAKER_00]: against oxidization so that when if that
if that individual organism that
[SPEAKER_00]: individual saprobe actually got exposed to
oxygen it would disintegrate or or exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to uv it would it would disintegrate so
that white is actually to basically think
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as the wrapping around your
electrical cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to prevent something from going
catastrophically wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most interesting component of that
is that when you find that, that mycelial
[SPEAKER_00]: cord in your year old, two year old wood
chips, and you pick it up and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: other little pieces of organic matter are
hanging on like a web underneath it,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you know you've got many, many
different later successionary species of
[SPEAKER_00]: sap ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why again, if you take the time
to actually harvest these chips that are
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded with mycelium and you heat it up
over 120, you just wasted all your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You killed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's so important that you
keep this at a lower temperature so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they will colonize your organic matter so
that when you go to actually strip it or
[SPEAKER_00]: use it, they have gone through a
sporulation phase where they have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point where they grew out a ton of
spores or clubs or feet depending on which
[SPEAKER_00]: camp you want to talk about as far as what
the different sexual methods that this
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi do to produce their offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to ask you about these different
sources for these mycelium, these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of fungals, because we know we
want them and we know we want as wide of a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that using IMO, indigenous
microorganisms, that's a simple low level
[SPEAKER_02]: version that will evolve some fungals,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we're also going to throw wood
chips into our pile because we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: capture these hundreds, if not thousands
of varieties of fungals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing though that we probably want
to pull our fungals from a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: different sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our IMO box is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our wood chips, that's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are a couple other places that I want
to hunt for wild crafting these fungals to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it back and put it in my pile so I
can have it be not only fungally dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but hella diverse fungally dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's clean up the Achilles
heel of IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is taught and most people understand
or believe that that IMO collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO1, is going to have all of the fungal
constituents that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only has the foundation, the yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's probably got some spores,
but it's not nearly as diverse as one
[SPEAKER_00]: would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, you see the microscope slides
people post on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called pin molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very important foundational
creatures for succession to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you producing a shit ton of pin molds,
but when you introduce IMO3, which again
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be very pin mold heavy,
and you introduce that into a IMO4,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when you blend it with soil,
that's when you're really going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your fungal colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to get your sap
robes, your more later succession fungi to
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play because there's the food
there for them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all those pin molds doing all
their thing that are providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation or the paving the highway for
the sap robes to come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for a slow version of
getting to a fungal dominance,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yeah, that works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is if you don't have super
healthy soil to blend with your IMO3,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get the kind of
fungally dominant compost that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to how do I get this into my low
temp pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one is finding the old one to
two year old punky wood chips with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to have tremendous diversity
in it because that cord, the thicker the
[SPEAKER_00]: cords are and the more long and webby the
cords are, the more different organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting, sap robes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece of this puzzle too is
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are fungal foods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know like steel cut oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them and you can
research this on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other wonderful place to get sap
robes are from leaf duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talk about prevailing wind,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everywhere you go, there's generally
what we consider the wind's direction that
[SPEAKER_00]: most days is going to be blowing in this
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you go to wherever there's a
stone wall, a downed tree, a crick or a
[SPEAKER_00]: depression, and the leaves that blow
across the yard will fall in a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: pile either behind that log or in that
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an incredibly diverse indigenous
saprobe fungi factory for you to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, diversity, diversity,
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves, chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straw is already going to have decomposers
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can add some emic acids,
they're also a very good biological
[SPEAKER_00]: superfood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good for both bacterial and fungal
kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have incredible
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's one last piece of this
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a place where you don't have
access to these kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to your local mushroom producer and
ask him for a spent mushroom block.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want mushroom compost because
mushroom compost has gone thermophilic and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been forced to kill all of the
biology because that's what the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: requires of anybody who's making
commercial compost has to hit that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's 150, three times over the
course of X amount of days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get mushroom compost,
you're not getting organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the mushroom block,
now you're getting the organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have access to many mushroom blocks,
which I will now go get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take this idea of wild
crafting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to kind of say, I want to apply
what you just said to my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everybody can kind of like do
that in their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In their own heads for where they live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about collecting these
leaf collections that have naturally come
[SPEAKER_02]: together in indentations and along tree
lines and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I'm wanting to do that kind of
collection in my neighborhood so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have got the widest diversity of fungals
in my cold compost as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, I would, for example, my neighbor
has got a long fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the leaves, like we have all seen
in suburban neighborhoods, even though I
[SPEAKER_02]: live way out, the leaves blow against the
fence and they collect at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can imagine going over there with
a five gallon bucket and just smushing all
[SPEAKER_02]: of these leaves together and filling that
bucket up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then, okay, great, I've got a
collection from this particular bio region
[SPEAKER_02]: along my neighbor's fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have got this huge ass tree in my
yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the base of the tree kind of
swells up because of the old root
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, there's always a whole bunch of
magic sitting in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, as you've talked about before,
there's all of these yeasts, these IMOs
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually kind of fall from these
trees, these fungal dusts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fall from the trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right, I will collect all of the
leaves that are at the bottom of the tree
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to get a little of this
little fir bits and some leaves and,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, random organic matter
debris.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll fill a bucket with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe I would go over to the
estuary here on the island, go over to
[SPEAKER_02]: Fern Cove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's all these different leaves
that get collected in the brush that is
[SPEAKER_02]: along with salt water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll get some salt spray and a
different variety of funguses because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's yet another different environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking to myself, I want the
environments to be different because these
[SPEAKER_02]: different biological environments are
going to have different fungals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I've got these three buckets full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this could be, you know,
you could do as many as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for this example, I got these three
buckets and I'm now going to put those in
[SPEAKER_02]: the pile along with my IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've got the very basic IMO yeasts
and I've got the way more complex fungals
[SPEAKER_02]: from three different areas near where I
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, I've got all this higher end,
cool mycelial action going on and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: hangers on that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that by ideal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, just a couple little points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're collecting leaf duff,
you really want to scrape back the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on the top and you want to get down
into the layer where they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: slimy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the magic is not in the in
the top layer that's dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top layer that's dried out will then
get covered by this year's crop of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and that'll pressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then become the wet, nasty,
slimy underneath for the following season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're looking to get partially
decomposed, naturally decomposed organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter in the form of leaves that have
started to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always encourage people to maybe
this is the perfect place to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial compost for six bucks is to
wildcraft responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring something in and leave that in
place of what you've taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way if you spread, you've taken
out say six feet of this top inch or two
[SPEAKER_00]: of this leaf mold, you can then spread
that commercial compost down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: cover it back up with the dried out
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've not just totally disturbed or
fucked nature by leaving a big scar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already talked about how while
it might not really work well for compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually works great as a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so and so we are we are helping
diversify that area right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other piece for mushroom
blocks is that people have to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that when they take that mushroom block
and they leave it, it's going to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid slimy stuff in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a biocide that's produced
by the fungi to protect from bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: infections and or yeast infections or
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fungi is doing everything it can to
to build a fortress with the white cake
[SPEAKER_00]: around the outside edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also releasing these bio toxins
to fight off anybody that could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: compete with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I generally tell people to do is
take the bag and run it over with your car
[SPEAKER_00]: on soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you smashed it and then just leave it
in the bag so it gets nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should get all different colors in it,
but it shouldn't have any real liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: build up because that's the biocide that
you do not want to add to your compost
[SPEAKER_00]: pile because you will knock back your
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dealing with mushroom blocks is a
little bit more creative than than one
[SPEAKER_00]: might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the longer you let those blocks dry
out and if it's raining, it's raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just don't allow that biocide to
build up in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to rip all the plastic off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the plastic on it until you're ready
to actually introduce it into your compost
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're going to introduce it
into your compost pile, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this funky smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, remember our noses are there to
protect us, to warn us from dangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you smell it, you're going to kind
of like pull your head back and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that smells really funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like when you ferment things,
it smells funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not going to want to eat this
stuff, but when it has that funky smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be providing all kinds of
secondary tertiary metabolites for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only part of that I want to tease at
is the running over it with your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that the car is the our goal is
to break up the cake so that the white on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside that is providing the
protective barrier for the cake gets
[SPEAKER_02]: destroyed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Disturbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the cakes that I have come in
contact with actually break up very easily
[SPEAKER_02]: in the bag by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it would be just as effective if I
just take the bag and I hold it well with
[SPEAKER_02]: my two hands and just twist my hands in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so break the exterior of the cake up a
bit and then just go with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only goal of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something to do with the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain it, biogeochemical process
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have noticed that when I do run it
over, again, I'm not trying to break it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to just kind of like squish out
any of the biocide and disturb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That outer coating so that now the local
indigenous biology can come into play and
[SPEAKER_00]: have fun with it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's still a tremendous amount
of resources in nutritional value that's
[SPEAKER_00]: locked up in that block that that fungi is
trying to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to expose it to my local
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting all of my indigenous
microorganisms to colonize it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm saying just run it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't want to tear the bag off
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to pop it so that,
again, air exchange can come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biocide gets squished out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let it sit and get funky,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more funky it gets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more diverse of microorganisms that
you'll get from your microenvironment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and take
another break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to finish up with set
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to talk more about the
mechanical massaging that Leighton does to
[SPEAKER_02]: create these community opportunities in
the inoculant organic material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to talk a little bit
about how to actually to use this in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today, is soil biologist Leighton
[SPEAKER_02]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: For decades, Americans have enjoyed
cannabis flowers and joints and bongs and
[SPEAKER_02]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with the normalization of cannabis
use increasing across the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the opportunity to enjoy smoking
cannabis luxuries that simply were not
[SPEAKER_02]: attainable before.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast, hand rolls, blunts,
cannons, rosin infused donuts and canigars
[SPEAKER_02]: available in the state of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast focuses on flavor over
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of growing their own flower,
North Coast goes out into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: community and creates relationships with
the best growers, working with the best
[SPEAKER_02]: new cannabis varieties available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely heavy THC is a factor, but North
Coast focuses on aroma, complex terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles and taste that continues
throughout the entire smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The North Coast team curates flowers like
others curate art.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seek out the best talent,
build relationships, helps them take their
[SPEAKER_02]: product to the highest levels and then
buys their well cured flowers in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: hand roll them just for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like their hand blown glass tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And North Coast has branched out beyond
canigars into rosin solventless THC A
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds and exceptional hash rosin carts
for on the go cannabis connoisseurs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast provides you with attainable
luxury, offering you an ultra premium
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking experience at a price that seems
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And repeatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: To find out more about North Coast line of
cannabis products, visit their Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: at northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when in Michigan, ask for North Coast
at your favorite shop, North Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_02]: their own and night owl seeds works
tirelessly, bringing you auto flower
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that are reliable, thriving and
with extraordinary terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Night owl seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their founder
[SPEAKER_02]: Daz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds and night owl
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds really are extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos and by fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proof is there and obvious terpenes
are complex and rich plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics,
like I am, you'll likely also love night
[SPEAKER_02]: owl seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Night owl founder Daz worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_02]: years, including breeding Mephisto's much
loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing both night owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And night owl seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs and desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Night owl even has the secret owl society
text club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just text the word night owl one word to
760-670-3130 for early announcements and
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about upcoming drops by following
[SPEAKER_02]: the night owl seeds Instagram too,
at Daz.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's D-A-Z.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get your packs of night owl seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and HEMBRA
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Night Owl Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_02]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_02]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_02]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_02]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_02]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_02]: in tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_02]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use,
and pit moss is inert so it won't change
[SPEAKER_02]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is soil biologist, Leighton
[SPEAKER_02]: Morrison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the break, Leighton and I were
talking about the inputs for this cold
[SPEAKER_02]: compost because when I visited him there
in Ventura, I don't know, right before
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID-E, started, he had all this stuff in
his backyard that he was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all looked like weeds and shrubs and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, oh, what are these
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, I'm growing this
stuff for my compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't think much about it and moved
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not until today that I realized
where as most of us will wild craft our
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs for the compost or we just produce
it like, you know, air quotes,
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally on our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leighton, you actually are growing green
inputs that you know you like for making
[SPEAKER_02]: your cold compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea of growing specific things
intentionally just to kill it for your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found it kind of inspiring and I'm
probably not the only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we move on, why don't you just
hit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you growing for your compost and
why do you bother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question, Django.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that, again, diversity,
diversity, diversity is the key to making
[SPEAKER_00]: some incredible end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I grow indigenous grasses,
pollinator plants, flowers, even some
[SPEAKER_00]: little shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I don't kill them,
I just cut them back from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't let things go to seed that I put
into the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see something that's gonna seed
out, I either just let it seed out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then wait till it's done seeding and then
take the brown because the plant dies
[SPEAKER_00]: after it seeds out and just make sure that
I'm getting all the seeds off of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: leave them in place in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the greens, of course,
I trim back the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love flowers in my compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just bring a whole nother
level of biological superfoods to the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposers that they wouldn't ordinarily
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that everybody,
if you got a little corner somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can obviously just buy green manure
seeds or wildflower seeds or whatever's
[SPEAKER_00]: locally grown or locally responsibly grown
in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go through a harsh winter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have certain plants that do die
back in the colder weather, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part, everything pretty much grows
year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very blessed in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was to say, do this in New
England, I typically would build a pile in
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and I'd build a pile in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be harvesting whatever I could get
my hands on in the spring, like the new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the fall, I would obviously be
collecting stuff throughout the summer to
[SPEAKER_00]: build the pile in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit trickier in an area
where you have a true hard winter to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you only built one pile a
year, you'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's no reason why you can't
harvest the local or grow whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel is important for your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use the biomass in your compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea because you kind of put it
on its head, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I grow flowers and all this kind
of stuff on my property, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they naturally find their way into a
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that you kind of went
backwards and you're like, OK,
[SPEAKER_02]: what stuff do I like in my compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm going to grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a subtle but important difference
from, oh, I grew all this stuff because I
[SPEAKER_02]: just like the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope it makes good compost versus I
want good compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to pick the flowers and
grasses that make good compost that also I
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it changes the direction of the
decision making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that kind of delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll actually like pull up roots
and use those in the compost as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something seeds, I'll let it seed
out and then I'll pull that plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got seeds that are going to
happen, pop next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll compost that root ball because
that's got the rhizosphere in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are in set three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two main things I want to talk
about is first, you have talked about the
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanical ways in which you manipulate
the organic matter to make more porous
[SPEAKER_02]: community opportunities for all the life
forms in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've kind of just hit on that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've referred to it as massaging,
but like I've been to your workshop and
[SPEAKER_02]: seen all the stuff that you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think so far we've given everybody a
pretty good roadmap for how to make this
[SPEAKER_02]: at their house, except for this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you take us through the different
mechanical manipulations that you work the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter through so that it is
optimum for an inoculant process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I recently did a
video, a one hour lecture and an outline
[SPEAKER_00]: with a friend of mine, Jimmy Perkins,
who's actually going to put it up online
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about charging 50 bucks for
it, but it would be a great resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to actually physically see what I'm
talking about and how I go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that was designed for
the homeowner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's using mechanical forces on a
smaller scale than what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But needless to say, these mechanical
forces are scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a 85 gallon compost,
or excuse me, yogurt maker that I
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into one of my strippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I call her Raquel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my other stripper, I call her Sandy,
because I went through Superstorm Sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sandy Hook in New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what, poor Sandy's
got a bad name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's make something good out of the
name Sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one that I travel with is Sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically a older washing
machine that I converted to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I call soft collision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a soft collision, think about the
two of us standing in a pool up to our
[SPEAKER_00]: neck in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And underwater, I punch you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to feel the force of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were standing in the air and I did
that, you'd feel some serious pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of philosophy that I
want you to think about when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about soft colliding organic
materials or matters together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way that you're brushing off the
loose pieces, the fungi, the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not damaging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically using its own biomass to
break off the pieces that are suitable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to be used as poem to inoculate your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So number one is soft colliding using a
washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you give a quick description of your
retrofit of that washing machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to find a really old machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer ones have a lot of different
sensors and computers, thanks to China,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I've tried desperately to convert to
many, many lost hours and frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as soon as I get rid of this
control, that sensor is tripping and now
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine won't go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I keep this control, but I get rid of
that sensor because I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now this control will no longer
function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to find a very old machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can get anything after
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not going to be able to
convert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, there's not a huge
pool of these pieces of equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: have survived that long in a junk pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a particular easy way to go
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this conversion back in about 2010
was when I made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had access to used appliance stores
that had plenty of older inventory that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could manipulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bottom line is you have to gut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take the whole thing apart,
power wash the inside, get rid of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: residues, all the soap scum, you've got to
replace bearings, check for wire phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're basically looking at taking all
of the wiring out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically have two functions,
spin and agitate, and no time restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those little control, that little
dial, you bypass that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something for the
lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be somewhat of a mechanical
or high mechanical aptitude and somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: of an inventor to actually do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I did it, anybody could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, the more simple way
for a user friendly small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: application is to just use a paint mixer
or a compound mixer and a cordless drill
[SPEAKER_00]: on a low setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I did this video with
Jimmy so that people could see,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wow, this is really actually quite
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my work, I've taken it a little bit
further because I'm really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the most powerful inoculant I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also use, along with agitation,
I use aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a little air pump that pumps air
down into the agitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the agitator, I created these whips
out of polyethylene pipes that go all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way out to the edge of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that's going back and forth,
those are basically acting as a sweep to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweep the material off the floor of the
washing machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the aeration now, as it sweeps,
it's blowing the stuff higher up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water column, and then only to sink back
down in the center and repeat,
[SPEAKER_00]: agitate and repeat, repeat, repeat,
or what is it, rinse and repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing that, I'm adding another level
of physical force to this organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's colliding on the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting swept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting pushed into each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I'm adding a
tremendous amount of oxygen, dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, into the aqueous solution of fish,
brew, and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really getting another added
benefit by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, without a proper piece of
equipment, it's a lot more difficult to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yogurt mixer has sweeps on the
outside, pushing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cone bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I've used a tremendous
amount of oxygen blowing up through the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's creating that same aeration
agitation that I did with the washing
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, I have two
impellers opposing each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one impeller is pulling from the bottom
and throwing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impeller above that is actually
pulling from the top and throwing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting three levels of agitation
with that piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because I'm trying
to do it as efficient and as quick as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using all the different forces
possible to, again, produce a high volume
[SPEAKER_00]: of super powerful inoculant in a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this washing machine that you have
messed with, it's got the organic material
[SPEAKER_02]: and water in it, what's coming out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inside the barrel, you'll see that it's
got holes, little tiny eighth inch drill
[SPEAKER_00]: holes all the way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those drill holes are acting as a
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm washing my compost,
anything bigger than an eighth inch isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get through those holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stays in the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I spin it, I'm now pulling all of
that moisture out of that product or out
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's left in the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's left in the barrel,
I just scoop up and I throw it right back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the compost pile again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first level of screening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the water that's coming out of it,
that is not a waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's actually the goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're using the water and the
agitation to strip everything out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: organic material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while you're still going to throw that
organic material back in the pile,
[SPEAKER_02]: the goal is to have the organic material
give up its goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And release all the humic acids,
fulvic acids, secondary tertiary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, along with all of the biology
that went in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm using fish brew in that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm basically using about a gallon and
a half of fish brew and about three and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half to four gallons by volume of compost
in that one process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on a smaller scale, you can do this
in a compound bucket and buy a quarter a
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of fish brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that in there with a couple handfuls
of compost, agitate for 15, 20 minutes on
[SPEAKER_00]: slow, and you'll get the same end results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just won't have been as efficient in
removing all of those organisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: components that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you and I both share a love of
the fish brew product, but I'm always
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to make people self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody doesn't want to buy the
fish brew, they can go their own way and
[SPEAKER_02]: collect fish poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So find themselves an aquaponics company
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is that fish brew is the easy
way to go, but you can also do this if you
[SPEAKER_02]: use your aquarium water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquarium water is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, personally, I don't know why every
farmer does not have at least a friggin
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead, why not a fish pond?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always promote aquatic microorganisms as
so important and one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: missing pieces from the soil because we
don't have mass migration anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil used to get inoculated every time
a migration occurred, but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AMOs are, in my mind, the foundation of
creating regenerative, healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without them, what are you really
accomplishing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So another way to get aquatic
microorganisms is to do a wild craft of
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp or algae, duckweed, any of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any aquatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in a bucket, put the wire
mesh on top, put a brick on it so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are all submerged below the water,
put it in the hot sun for three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: days, depends on where you are and what
temperature you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you'll see is a white frothy foam
that raises to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's going to have a funky
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your body's going to be like,
ew, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to kind of get a reaction
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to smell like poop,
but it's not going to smell like forest
[SPEAKER_00]: floor either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell funky, kind of like
those mushroom blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a very powerful aquatic
microorganism inoculant that you can pour
[SPEAKER_00]: on your compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny that you say that about
fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just traveled the entire country and
we did soil awareness classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did seven of them across the
country and I had the same answer at every
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, you need fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you need fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got to the point where I was
like, man, these people probably think I
[SPEAKER_00]: own fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no stake in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can tell you is that I've been using
that product since Rodale, since the
[SPEAKER_00]: inception of trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually before Rodale, I'd come to
realize that there was something really
[SPEAKER_00]: special about fish manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every time I poured it on a plant,
I'd see plant reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole reason I went down to
Rodale to talk to this woman named Elaine,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I had no idea who she was,
and show her this stuff and put it under
[SPEAKER_00]: the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came back and goes, holy shit,
where did you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the missing piece of the pie,
the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in soil science, they're missing
the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's missing the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you do this with your own compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two choices, time or money.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of time,
then you need to spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of money,
then you've got to spend the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you do it without fishbrew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to take time and end trials
and learning how to work with aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to how you are mechanically
breaking up and stripping your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the first one, which is your
soft colliding washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so soft colliding, aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dissolved oxygen in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, adding those other elements,
because every time that bubble comes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pushing something out of the way and
displacing and putting it back into a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical force position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after you go through those basic,
or I want to call beginning processes of
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling apart the organic matter,
the next would be through dewatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by dewatering, there's a couple of
different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some really cool screw presses
where you'd feed in this slurry at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a big auger in it, and it
presses that material until the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: oozes out the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, you just get this cake
that comes out the end, where when the
[SPEAKER_00]: screw pressure has gotten so great that
the end of it will kind of open up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and let some of the dewatered
organic matter spill out into the waste
[SPEAKER_00]: pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I've went toward what's called
a concrete vibrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to mount on the walls of
foundations so that you're vibrating the
[SPEAKER_00]: concrete to get all of the air out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use that in conjunction with a metal
or wood frame and with a stainless steel
[SPEAKER_00]: mesh screen that I string like a guitar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I suspend it on these rubber
isolators so that the vibration is only
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring on the screen and not vibrating
everything else around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've basically isolated the vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I hit the certain, if you do
this, you get the variable speed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you turn it up or down, and you'll get
this point where it's called resonance,
[SPEAKER_00]: when everything is vibrating and the
liquid just pours out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not right, what's going to
happen is the top is going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrating, and you're going to see all
this air bubbles and stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you hit that sweet spot,
that resonance, you're not seeing any
[SPEAKER_00]: surface action on the top, but you're just
hearing the water pouring out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a couple of different advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, yes, you're getting the
maximum amount of liquid out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter that is otherwise
oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through vibration, you're exciting
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gets really fucking deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But excited electrons tend to want to
interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the most interesting phenomena
behind this process is that I noticed,
[SPEAKER_00]: after I've vibrated it and say,
I want to sift out some rejuvenate or some
[SPEAKER_00]: alliance, which is one of the two
products, the solid products that I make,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see the liquid goes through,
and then the clumps on the surface start
[SPEAKER_00]: to clod.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to attach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to form microaggregates almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed, too, that when I take it
to the next level and stabilize or
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dewater, the alliance or the
rejuvenate, I basically put it in a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: press, a screw press, and I just keep
cranking it until I squeeze out what is
[SPEAKER_00]: literally pure fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then take that cake and I, again,
run it through a vibrating screen to
[SPEAKER_00]: create that soft, fluffy stuff that you
talked about earlier in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put that stuff on soil,
oh my god, automatically clay platelets,
[SPEAKER_00]: sand particles, they just start to bond
together and create these microaggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only explain it through my
understanding of quantum mechanics,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you stimulate electrons and
protons, that you can actually create
[SPEAKER_00]: these paramagnetic charges that begin to
want to attract or repel based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a deep one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, makes sense, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got five of these so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soft colliding washing machine,
aeration bubbles, dewatering press,
[SPEAKER_02]: concrete vibrator, and then a vibrating
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's the majority of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, again, your goal here is to lower
the moisture value of the product if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to make it shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If shelf stability isn't an issue and you
just want to make it and use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't have to go through all of
these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just literally just take it,
mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I poured it into a paint strainer,
which was stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have used a insect screen because
in turn, we're only putting it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering can and watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need to take all the big chunks
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more chunky it is, the better and
higher level of inoculation that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: create quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the chunkier, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those are pretty much the
primary forces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just a matter of,
all right, how are you applying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll drive you to, all right,
I got to screen it to this level because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running it through a diaphragm pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not use centrifugal force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centrifugal force creates cavitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cavitation kills biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to have any kind of
mechanical pumps that will create
[SPEAKER_00]: cavitation or centrifugal force.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use a diaphragm pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are using a diaphragm pump and
you've got spray rig or nozzles that you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to deal with, then you have to screen
to that level to get it out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a pause here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people who possibly like me,
these last five steps that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned are very off-putting,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wouldn't do this stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important to point out
that the point of the show was to
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage folks to make a cold compost,
which is essentially a organic material
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't have to do this last part.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you needed to do was just put the care
into collecting your plants and then not
[SPEAKER_02]: let the pile get too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point of what we're
encouraging folks to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to do it right, you need to do things
like make sure you avoid your pathogens by
[SPEAKER_02]: using plant material only and make sure it
doesn't get too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the stuff that we talked about
during set two, these things that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about now, number one,
they remove the water to make your final
[SPEAKER_02]: material shelf stable, but also by
breaking it up, it creates lots of places
[SPEAKER_02]: for microbe life to attach to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that the compost will be quickly
integrated into wherever you place it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, increases the places for
community, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's all these like 360 degree
ridges everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we lost you here at the beginning
of set three with this mechanical stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't lose heart because you don't have to
do this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really just a way to finish it if
you need to make it stable where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make it once a year and then let
it sit all year, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that this is important to
understand is all about delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've grown these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made this beautiful biologically
rich compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get that biology into the soil
effectively and efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do that is with liquid
because the liquid will help move those
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms down into the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your compost, this amazing stuff
that you made, and you top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 50% of it's going to get oxidated
and die or exposed to UV and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how effective did you get those
microorganisms down into the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost 50% of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're actually making two products
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one product is the actual low moisture
inoculated compost that even though you've
[SPEAKER_02]: removed most of the water, it is still
brimming with life and it's essentially a
[SPEAKER_02]: dry good that you can sell in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's a secondary product or
useful product, which is the water that
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps on coming out of this stuff,
which is just also brimming with life.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care about it being shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to pour that on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key again is delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get these microorganisms into
a condominium where they have food,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do we get them down into the
soil profile where they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe and sound and continue to grow and
inoculate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other product that we're talking
about is harmonize, highly unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave this in a bucket for a day,
maybe two, it's going to go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the water,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go anaerobic because there's
just so much what's called biological
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen demand, BOD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's so much going on in
activity, they're stripping the dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen out of that water at such a fast
rate that it can't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it goes anaerobic, well,
now I've defeated my whole purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: My purpose was to get minerals,
nutrients, biology into the soil so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it could do its work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was no longer mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if it rained, it didn't
wash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go anaerobic, I've basically made
a nutrient solution that's all the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs right there in that liquid,
even though it smells like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pour it on that plant, the plant's
going to be able to take it up really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it rains or I water, I've washed it
all out of the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the real missing piece
is mobile or not mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal was always to produce
non-mobile nutrients that in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: biology that could be there as a nutrient
bank forever, for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the mechanical side of this is
how to effectively and efficiently deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: this very sensitive biology down into a
place where it is safe and it has food,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are somebody like me who is
very interested in a cold compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not going to do the mechanical
aspects of this, it is also fabulous and
[SPEAKER_02]: way better than your thermal compost if
you were to just make this cold compost
[SPEAKER_02]: pile and then make a compost tea with it
and just pour it on your plants and get
[SPEAKER_02]: right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's essentially what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a compost extract, not a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeah, you could take this biological
compost, throw it in your brewer,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you put it in a bag or free-brew
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I would free-brew it,
which is basically just throw handfuls in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, bubble it for 30 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we need to touch base on that,
why that's such a critical point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've made a compost brew,
so I've taken a handful of this compost
[SPEAKER_00]: that I made, the cold compost,
threw in a little bit of sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you want to make sure using
unsulfur blackstrap molasses, no more than
[SPEAKER_00]: one ounce per 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use more, you're going to raise
the biological oxygen demand, BOD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to have an anaerobic shit
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to eat very little bit of
foods, you bubble it for 30 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then use it up by hour 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is that between hour 20
and hour 24 is when you start to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: high level of protozoan production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you've provided the
bacteria, you've provided the deer,
[SPEAKER_00]: now all of a sudden the lions,
the bears, and the wolves are coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're breeding like crazy because
there's so much food in the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's critical that you wait
till hour 30 so that you've had a good six
[SPEAKER_00]: to eight hours of high level of protozoan
production because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's missing the protozoan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have bacterially dominant soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the missing piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that are eating the
bacteria and releasing that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other point is that, yeah,
if you just took this cold compost and you
[SPEAKER_00]: threw it in some water and agitated it
with your hands and then poured it on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, now you've basically made a
compost extract with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you need the mechanical stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can use your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to take the time to
actually massage it with your hands for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time, wouldn't it have been
easier to use a power drill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was going to say it's all about
delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you getting those organisms into
the soil the most effective and efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the key to this is go ahead
and make your cold compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you have that, there's a whole
bunch of different ways that you can apply
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're encouraging you to make the pile
and don't overheat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you have that, you can do it the
easy way, which is how I will be doing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is to take a few handfuls and bubble
it up for 30 hours and put it on your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take that further because
maybe you're scaled and you want this to
[SPEAKER_02]: be available to you in a few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then go through more of the
mechanical stuff, press out the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you can put that compost on the
shelf and it will be ready for you when
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to use it in a few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use that water now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, it's all about getting that
pile made and not having the pile get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about making ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: One interesting footnote I would like to
throw in here is that people will be
[SPEAKER_02]: astonished at all the unexpected benefits
that come from using a biology-rich cold
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one example that I want to have,
because it's really hard to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, my plant's color got so much better,
and oh, the flowers were so good,
[SPEAKER_02]: and oh, my gosh, the flowers tasted
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like it had a wider terpene profile
than I normally get.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that's true, but it's really hard to
measure that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I can tell you is, if you go back
in the Shaping Fire Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you go back to Instagram, we've got
this four-by-four indoor bed that,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I'm using electricity for LED
lights, I'm trying to use regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of is an experiment, because doing
regenerative stuff indoors has got its own
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did that, and I ended up with a
fungus gnat breakout for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking with my providers about
the beneficial insects I want and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I call you to bitch, because we're
friends and we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, ah, I got this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, let me send you up
this cold compost that I've made,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then bubble it up and pour it on your
bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't understand how a
freaking compost tea is going to get rid
[SPEAKER_02]: of my gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, it's going to make the soil
more wet, and I'm going to get more fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, well, first of all,
it's not a tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you said, just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, all right, well,
I trust you enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very often, I will just do the stuff you
say and then watch for the benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did, and I'll be
damned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made this, and I put the five gallons of
it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I sprayed it on the top,
so I made sure that I got all the top
[SPEAKER_02]: areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I just poured the rest in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no fungus gnats within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called you, and I'm all like,
what kind of sorcery is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did you explain it to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sorcery.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what you did was you threw down
a bunch of hungry microbes with a food
[SPEAKER_00]: source of fungal larvae, fungal gnat
larvae all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just went to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like buffet time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the predators, essentially,
that were in this highly inoculated
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, they went and they ate all the
larvae of the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never even considered that approach
to fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked nearly instantly and was
very economical to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is just an example I want to give
folks for once you start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we all love the microbes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all believe in IMO, and we all
believe in using nature as our ally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is kind of next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage folks to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in bringing us kind of to a close here,
Leighton, we talked about what kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: compost or things that are called compost
are available to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about what those options
were like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, like vermiculture
compost, we freaking love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it, like the bag stuff,
we don't really love.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one thing was that we wanted to
encourage folks to not heat their pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people go ahead and they don't heat
their piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using clean, non-pathogenic green
materials and browns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have this and they make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they've got what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going to be the nature of the pot
container or the soil if you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: right in the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of bring us home here by describing
the nature of the soil after this
[SPEAKER_02]: application versus the nature of their
soil before the application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll end with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the whole point of this
conversation is soil aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason you use compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason we use microbes is
because they actually form aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is aggregation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregation is like a little clump of
sand, silt, and clay in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside that clump is waterfalls and ponds
and cities and walkways and parks and all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different creatures and
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider it a zoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so inside that, and it's in this
article that talks about the magic,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biogeochemical reactions that are
happening inside that aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have tools to measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the technology to test it or
monitor it or actually scope it in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new instrument that was
invented I believe last year that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope that you push into the soil and
you can leave it there for days,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and monitor this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kinds of tools that we're
going to need to really advance our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding on how valuable soil
aggregates are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aggregates are a combination of fungi,
bacteria, protozoa, the physical side of
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well as the chemical side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the triple threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the physical, the chemical,
and the biological coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the aggregates are so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, aggregates let the oxygen down,
lets the CO2 out, back up to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows water to infiltrate into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just running off and creating
erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggregation is the critical foundation
to soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have aggregates without good
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have compacted soil because you don't
have the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you have the biology and the
organic matter in play, you will begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: form aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's why I went through this
whole process of vibrating shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting the electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will form these aggregates
extremely quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole purpose of taking this
biological compost and manufacturing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of better words, so that you're
getting a faster response in building the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health and building those aggregates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not lost on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is one of the reasons
why, as I learned more about cold compost
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts, why I kept on pursuing this
until I figured out what this was enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a show about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that this is the future of
regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that thermal compost has been a
great tool for the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are sophisticated enough now to
know how to work with the microbes and to
[SPEAKER_02]: know that our biggest role is to A,
stop fucking killing all the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then second, add microbes and help
incubate them and make more of them as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as possible because we're not really
the ones that are going to clean up the
[SPEAKER_02]: mess we've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the microbes that are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we are dedicating ourselves to
not only working within the natural forces
[SPEAKER_02]: of the earth, but also to play our role to
maximize them, I think that's the only
[SPEAKER_02]: direction that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've we've learned how to break
shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got to learn to put things back
together again, the way nature would have
[SPEAKER_00]: through biomimicry and not not through our
ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if for lack of better words,
I think that is the best word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, Layton, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always appreciate you,
you know, both our friendship and then
[SPEAKER_02]: having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was extra special today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you sharing these these
insights, some of them pretty damn
[SPEAKER_02]: revolutionary and and also, you know,
slogging through three hours of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm exhausted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even the one that was talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you too, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doing a lot of hard work for
many years and you bring a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: message to to the community as well as the
general population as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure for me to be able to share
what I've learned in my experiences with
[SPEAKER_00]: you and your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to follow along with
Layton's exploits, there are two ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first way is on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow his Instagram profile at
Kingdom Aquaponics LLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you straight up,
like he's not a huge social media guy
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's usually filthy and in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he does post stuff to the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is always interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he goes on tours, you'll find all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you have some reason you
want to reach out, he does check his
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that's Kingdom Aquaponics LLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you can also find Layton
