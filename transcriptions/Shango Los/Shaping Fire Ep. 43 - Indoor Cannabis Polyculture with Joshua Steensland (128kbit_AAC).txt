[SPEAKER_01]: For decades there have been two families
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outdoor growers who use a sunshine and
indoor growers who used lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They each developed their own approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both dabbled in synthetic nutrients,
but indoor growers really approached
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic and processed nutrients as an
art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor folks generally were using less
processed inputs, but certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both groups tended to use chemical
pesticides when needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 20 years, as people became
more aware of eating organic food,
[SPEAKER_01]: health-conscious cannabis farmers,
both indoors and outdoors, began reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: their synthetic inputs and using more raw,
natural materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very generally, though, it was the outdoor
folks who were leading in that direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: and indoor growers were still focused on
bottled nutrients, especially hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that has been turned upside down,
as more cultivators in every part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry began to use more natural inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, with state taxation of cannabis,
came regulations that nearly demanded the
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusion of many of the traditional
chemicals growers would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a person who's dedicated to living
soil, you can imagine my curiosity and
[SPEAKER_01]: glee when I came across images on
Instagram of grow operations in just about
[SPEAKER_01]: every legal state, beginning to bring
living soil techniques indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lushness of the polyculture and
companion planning, but done indoors in
[SPEAKER_01]: raised beds or on tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started talking to other folks like me
about these amazing photos I was seeing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were all jazzed about these new
possibilities, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bright future of climate-controlled
indoor growing, but with real living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and worms instead of mechanized
hydroponics.

[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Joshua Steensland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua Steensland is a lifelong cannabis
cultivator and educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is presently lead cultivator at
Freshwater Farms in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also has a very active YouTube channel
where he teaches cannabis horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formerly, he was a hydroponics store owner
with a heavy emphasis on customer
[SPEAKER_01]: education and has himself evolved from
using synthetics to using organic bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and is now dedicated to living
soil, no-till, and raw amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk about all of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start by giving a little context
to folks about where you come from kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I don't know, philosophically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you find your way to indoor
polyculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, were you an indoor guy who wanted to
be more natural or were you an outdoor guy
[SPEAKER_01]: who then brought your outdoor skills
indoors for work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm actually always been an indoor
cultivator and I just never had the space
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it outdoors and always just kind of
was really intrigued with the idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: being having a controlled environment and
being able to control all those different
[SPEAKER_02]: atmospheric variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually just kind of gravitated
towards wanting to do things in a more
[SPEAKER_02]: natural fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I ended up where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting because,
you know, for so long, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the indoor folks were like,
listen, you just can't use these outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't make the transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a long time, people kind of,
you know, some people believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now suddenly in the last few years,
people like you are actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first started implementing
this stuff and, you know, telling your
[SPEAKER_01]: buddies about it, did you get some
disbelief and pushback and you had to
[SPEAKER_01]: push, you know, prove them wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or were people like, hell yeah,
man, go that direction?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a fair amount of healthy
skepticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I just kept progressing and kept
pushing forward, people were seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: results I was getting and they're kind of
speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what started all of this
with me reaching out to you is I just
[SPEAKER_01]: started following you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the images of your polycultured tables
at Freshwater were just like astonishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, just like looking them
and making the picture big, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that you can look really closely
and going, oh my God, he's actually doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was all really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, aside from the cannabis
chemovars that you're choosing,
[SPEAKER_01]: how did you go about choosing your
companion plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got a lot of options to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you think through that challenge?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of really good
information and there's a lot of great
[SPEAKER_02]: companies like Build A Soil that put
together cover crop blends that are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of pre-made for living soils that have
lots of clover and, you know, nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing companion plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that kind of information available,
readily available, it was really easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of just dive in and start learning
what was happening below the surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not with just the cannabis
roots, but with the roots of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and even like the foliage with the
dynamic accumulators like comfrey and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot that I just really just dove in
and started looking into what all those
[SPEAKER_02]: what all the benefits are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that I kept coming up with
was diversity is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you really you really want a
diverse population of companion plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: because they all do something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have their little part to play in
this symphony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seems to me that the more
parts, the more things that are allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: play their part, the sweeter the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nicely put.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many notes do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this may be a question that you
don't actually know, but do you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: many other species of companion plants
you've got outside of the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's pretty considerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started with the 12 seed cover crop crop
land from build a soil and then which is
[SPEAKER_02]: like 60 percent clovers, different clovers
and vetch and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started adding other things
like daikon, radish, beets, broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have and I've recently learned that
broccoli might actually not be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a potential fungal inhibiting
component of its of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to some research to do on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so we're always learning, you know,
we're all forever educating myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I learn that something's not good
for the bed, like if I learn the broccoli
[SPEAKER_02]: is not good, I'm taking it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got so many, so many things in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really just not afraid to throw
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the broccoli may not make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you already experimented with any
other plants that you decided don't work
[SPEAKER_01]: for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest with you, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything tends to the things
that some things just don't come back from
[SPEAKER_02]: the flowering period because the canopy
gets so dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a relatively large die off that
happens underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the vegetative stage,
when there's lots of light penetrating the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop flourishes and then your
companion plants flourish and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy kind of overtakes things and you
get a lot less light down there to the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's this die off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes things just don't come back
like I've had come free die off and not
[SPEAKER_02]: come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really fuss or worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figure if the conditions weren't
right for that particular one to come
[SPEAKER_02]: back, then I'm not really worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really considered how the the
dense canopy of a cannabis plant would
[SPEAKER_01]: block out the light from the unders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly it's like, you know,
like when you visit the the the giant
[SPEAKER_01]: redwoods, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly just ferns and and,
you know, duff on the ground at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the plants that when the
plants are when the cannabis plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: young, they're getting full light,
suddenly they're going to get choked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's have you ever like replanted or added
low light plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you start bloom?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a that's an interesting
consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do re seed occasionally, like if we get
a significant die off and for one reason
[SPEAKER_02]: or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the the large leaves like,
say, especially of comfrey, they'll die
[SPEAKER_02]: off and they'll completely choke out any
light from the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you end up once the comfrey leaves have
been kind of consumed by the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biology, you're left with a bare spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so occasionally I'll have to reseed
those bare spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but us making specific light,
low light plant considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really kind of appreciate the nutrient
cycling fact factor that happens when the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop flourishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all this nutrient capacity in its
leaves and then the flower growing period
[SPEAKER_02]: starts and then so it dies off and creates
like a mulchy layer over the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just building to the humus layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's contributing to a nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, it just allows me to
spend less time in the garden and just
[SPEAKER_02]: allow that kind of little micro ecosystem
to do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly get the value of when you
get the die off that that nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_01]: is natural and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two, I guess, really specific
questions about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one would be, if having the
cover crop with one of the benefits of it
[SPEAKER_01]: is that it creates this like mini
rainforest down near the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it holds in moisture and water vapor
down towards the top of the soil so that
[SPEAKER_01]: your microbes can live closer to the top
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you worry at all that if you've got
these patches that you're losing that
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage or over the size of an entire
bed, it doesn't really matter that much?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you take the whole bed into
consideration, it's not as big of a
[SPEAKER_02]: factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the benefit, I think,
of having a larger soil volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've often used the analogy of aquarium
keeping or fish tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used to keep little nano reef
tanks and 55 gallon tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for obvious reasons, the smaller the
tank, the harder it is to keep things in
[SPEAKER_02]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the larger the volume of water in a
tank, it's a lot easier to keep it pH
[SPEAKER_02]: stable and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really similar in soil beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a larger four by eight,
you got 1.2 or 1.3 yards in of soil in
[SPEAKER_02]: your bed, little pockets of say anaerobic
bacterial activity or little pockets of
[SPEAKER_02]: areas that are running less than optimally
aren't such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take a little sidebar here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned aquariums and I too have got
a background in aquariums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually after my brain injury,
one of the only things I could do was
[SPEAKER_01]: raise specialty aquarium shrimp and sell
those to other aquarium people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only do stoner folk just like
looking at fish, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I find that people
who are into aquariums and building that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of natural and yet artificial
environment also take quickly to growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because they are similar ideas
where it's like, okay, I wanna make this
[SPEAKER_01]: as natural as possible, but I wanna do it
in this artificial environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulate nature inside my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that kind of an experience for you
too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had similar conversations with people
about this very topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point in time, I was really big
into hydroponics and recirculating deep
[SPEAKER_02]: water culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I very often just kept feeling like it
was back in my aquarium days because
[SPEAKER_02]: really in both of those instances,
you're just water keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're water tenders and it's your job to
keep the water conditions perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's that obvious correlation
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you kind of touched on it too,
that there's this kind of desire to
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate something natural and do it in
the most pristine way possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just this kind of this
intrinsic reward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your idea of aquarium being,
we're water keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of the famous natural
farming guy, Joel Saladin, who always
[SPEAKER_01]: said, listen, I don't farm foods and
chickens and cattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just like, I'm a grass farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so long as the grass is healthy and
pesticide and chemical free, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: animals that live upon it will do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always thought that that related
really well to regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growing as well, where a lot of what we're
doing is we're soil farmers, we're microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as that soil is bountiful,
it will offer the buffet of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that our cannabis plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just do it on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wonderful, beautiful miracle that
we've been given.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really proud and impressed to see
the speed at which people are starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of reclaim this old ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like this revival of the old ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are sick of being lied to and being
poisoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you realize that there's just a
simpler way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just take care of the soil,
it takes care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So circling back to when we were talking
about some of the spots of the cover crop
[SPEAKER_01]: dying out, do you ever find that that is
helpful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a canary in a coal mine where if
something's going on with your cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's like letting you know of a
problem early that you might experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cannabis plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think if you allowed yourself to
kind of hyperanalyze things, you could
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely kind of postulate what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to, I really tend to be very,
very, very hands off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very Fukuoka-esque and I like to just
observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once the plants are in,
once things are going, it's really just
[SPEAKER_02]: our job to observe and kind of do gentle,
steering and guiding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what really works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My days of being kind of the mad scientist
in the grow room and spending hours in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, fussing over pH levels
and all these other things, those are
[SPEAKER_02]: over, those are long gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get to your question is when I see
bare spots on there, it's usually always
[SPEAKER_02]: been because of a thick patch from the die
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it, and when I revedge,
if it doesn't get kind of repopulated by
[SPEAKER_02]: the bloom of regrowth, then I'll,
you know, the next cycle, I'll reseed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really don't worry or concern myself
too much because, you know, it's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: simple process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you, as long as you follow a few
simple rules, it's really hard to go
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this next question, I'm going to
suggest three categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: of polycultural planting and, and you are
clearly more advanced than I am on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I'm going to suggest this
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just want to hear your,
your thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, even if you vehemently disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I find that so far in my learning
about polyculture planting, they seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: fall into three categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like first is companion planting of plants
that seem to encourage cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there seems to be inter planting,
which is just simply green filler to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: soil so that the moisture is higher up in
the soil towards the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gen, you know, they participate
in a generally healthy rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then there's, I guess
there's four categories, IPM planting of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that has something to do with
keeping pests away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people add a fourth
category, which is as food, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to go through all this,
this effort, you might as well get some,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, some cherry tomatoes
to eat while you're there or, or to the
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Nick and Liz over at a green
source gardens where, where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting huge amounts of food out of their
outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so with this in mind, you know,
how do you think about the different
[SPEAKER_01]: categories of polyculture plants when you
are strategizing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just got to give huge shout out
to green source gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are just the shining example of
regenerative homesteading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, you know, what they have is
something we should all be striving for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just, they've got a really
beautiful thing and I can't say enough
[SPEAKER_02]: good things about what, what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I second that the two I got there this
summer floored me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is the gold standard for
what we're all trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without question, without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the shining example of the tip of
the spear and they, they deserve all the
[SPEAKER_02]: alkylates that, that come with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the polyculture, you know,
all the categories, that you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should, when, when
participating in this cultivation style,
[SPEAKER_02]: we should try to achieve all of those
things in the beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think at first, my first
concern was maybe just kind of nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling and moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a time when I just used a rye
grass one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just planted a bunch of rye grass,
just, just specifically to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminate a lot of the composting material
that I had because I had a problem with
[SPEAKER_02]: woodlouse and roly-polies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was trying to eliminate their
food source, you know, just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: messing around with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't, I didn't really like how
the, how it felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what, what I got in the end,
when the die-off happened, I ended up with
[SPEAKER_02]: just this huge mat of rye grass and it
just didn't really work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've really learned that the,
once again, the greater diversity I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: the healthier things seemed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I started to include the
food crops that I don't really harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just leave in to rot, like the beets and
the daikon, parsnips and those kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think they're just,
they're just wildly valuable to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting that you leave them in
because I can see the advantages from
[SPEAKER_01]: that, of course, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the idea of, of growing the
food and being able to extract extra value
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, the, the novelty,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, look what I grew next to my
cannabis plants indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of letting it go through its
life cycle and then rotting there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, of course, that's going to create
the opportunity for so many micronutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wouldn't normally have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, now I want to play with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of it as just varying the,
the kind of the nutrient volumes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: earthworm castings, the natural earthworm
castings that we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if we give them various food
sources, you know, then the quality of the
[SPEAKER_02]: castings that we get fresh from the source
in the beds is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, when we design our,
our arc of light, if we will, for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants and, you know,
I think, I think you do 18-6, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: folks do 18-6, and then we, we switched to
12-12 for the bloom, but that's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: true for a lot of the plants that we are
putting into our polyculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious what your experience has
been finding these other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: these multitude of plants that you're
putting alongside the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they react to 18-6 and then 12-12?
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically when you flip,
because I would think that while we do
[SPEAKER_01]: that to kind of startle the cannabis
plants to suddenly bloom, that may well
[SPEAKER_01]: freak out a lot of the companion plants,
but I've never grown it at the level as
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to like, you know, have a good
set of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, what I've observed over time is
the, like, for instance, the broccoli
[SPEAKER_02]: never flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, for whatever reason, and I don't
know enough about how broccoli works
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily that it just is all,
it just stays in this perpetual vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the one, one thing that I've
noticed different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell what differences,
what the differences are attributed to
[SPEAKER_02]: when we flip, flipped a flower,
because the canopy is so dense by that
[SPEAKER_02]: time that changes have kind of already
started to happen at the lower levels
[SPEAKER_02]: before we even flipped it to 12-12 because
of the reduced light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really difficult to say,
you know, there's a pretty drastic and
[SPEAKER_02]: pronounced die off, you know, late in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the canopy is thick enough,
you know, to initiate flower at that point
[SPEAKER_02]: in time, they've been under reduced light
for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really hard to say what,
what light is doing at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a lot of variables at that
point and no control group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as like water usage goes,
you know, I find that generally the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've done it in the past kind of pre
poly culture, since this is new to me as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, but I have found that indoor
generally needs to be watered more than
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you companion plant this much,
you know, you're retaining a lot of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plants create that moist
rainforest effect at soil level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does planting poly culture impact
the water requirements?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible how little water is needed
for a four by eight bed when it's properly
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The companion plants do such a good job,
or even if you just used a straw mulch and
[SPEAKER_02]: you weren't even companion planting,
anything covering the soil is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help retain that moisture and help
prevent, you know, the transpiration of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I get by, like in my home
grow, I got three, four by eight beds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're fed by a, like a seven gallon
reservoir to blue mat drippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had to turn the water off,
that seven gallons would last me four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five days, maybe even a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water requirements are so nil and I
think it's just insanely valuable,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially as we, you know, when we start
thinking about conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that poly culture plus blue mat
really is a nice system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, we'll take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Joshua Steensland,
[SPEAKER_01]: lead cultivator at Freshwater Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to implement these biological
solutions, real science education is
[SPEAKER_01]: vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in all things
probiotic growing, you will probably want
[SPEAKER_01]: to attend the upcoming Science of Organic
Regenerative Cannabis Cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua Rutherford of Dutch Blooms has
lined up an incredible array of educators
[SPEAKER_01]: for the traveling event.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teaching staff includes Leighton
Morrison and Elaine Ingham on soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, Chris Trump talking Korean
natural farming, Kevin Jodry on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, Kelly and Josh from Dragonfly
Earth Medicine, Suzanne Wainwright,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bug lady, Dr. Robert Faust on natural
biostimulants, Steven Reisner on
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics and Chip Osborne on soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more folks will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a grower panel, a breeding
panel and a DEM certified farmers panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua has even built in significant
informal time for you with the teachers as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no advertising at the event,
no vendor booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tuition is what is paying the staff,
so they will all be very present and
[SPEAKER_01]: attentive to you, not a corporate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even better, the conference is not just
for folks on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt, California is hosting one event
for sure, but the show is going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: road to Vancouver, British Columbia,
Portland, Maine and Ann Arbor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out your pen now because I'm about to
give you the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fabulous opportunity for you to
hear from an array of nationally
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized top shelf soil educators all in
one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, this isn't just beginner
stuff like you get at most conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an intensive for people like us
who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The website is regenerativeorganiccannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find a link on the shaping
fire Instagram and newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn real soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a listener of shaping fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_01]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_01]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Joshua
Steensland, lead cultivator at Freshwater
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
the variety of polyculture plants and the
[SPEAKER_01]: positive impacts that they offer in your
indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are choosing your plants for
integrated pest management, did you choose
[SPEAKER_01]: for all potential pests that could happen,
or did you choose plants that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful for the ones that you usually have
to deal with locally in your bio region?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't give it a heck of a lot of
consideration aside from just basic
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I use mint and marigold at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mint has been my main kind of IPM
companion plant, but mainly I tend to use
[SPEAKER_02]: companion plants less for IPM and more for
pests, kind of like the canary in the coal
[SPEAKER_02]: mine for pest ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned that clover flower,
when it's allowed to flower, the thrips
[SPEAKER_02]: really like clover flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you have flowering clover,
thrips are gonna attack that clover first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider mites seem to really like clover
over cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, that's kind of the low hanging
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, the companion plant is really
more of an observational tool to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: help me see where we have a potential
hotspot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also just knowing things that like
clover flower attracts thrips,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can take some preventative measure,
preventative IPM measures by adding the
[SPEAKER_02]: proper beneficials, say before your
clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is flowering to tackle the potential
influx of thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that idea of the plant as the
canary in coal mine, because I had not
[SPEAKER_01]: really considered that perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: When planting companion plants for IPM,
normally it's either, okay, I'm gonna add
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant because it gives off terpenes
that wards off pests, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just simple trap plants,
which is kind of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, about the clover flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it will attract the thrips to your
clover flower instead of to your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this additional idea that,
oh, these trap plants are actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: thermometer letting me know how much my
pest infestation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as all of us living soil folks
know, it's not about having zero thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about keeping the thrips you have in
balance and never letting them overrun the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really novel idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of those things that,
you know, clover, spider mites like the
[SPEAKER_02]: clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean they're not gonna make
their way onto your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they certainly hit the clover first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same, definitely with the thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just one of those deals where,
like I said, the low-hanging fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're observing that, that's usually
where you're gonna start to get your first
[SPEAKER_02]: signs and indications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been an insanely invaluable tool
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're talking about pests,
let's talk about the use of essential
[SPEAKER_01]: oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of folks, you know, there's an
ongoing debate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People say that if you foliar feed certain
essential oils, that the pests don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll avoid your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly we're talking about,
you know, veg or only in the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe week of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking about latent flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then other folks, right, the other
folks will say, nah, nah, nah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't wanna spray essential oils on
your plants because the oils plug stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: and make it more difficult for the plants
to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've watched enough of the videos on
your fabulous YouTube channel to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a pretty strong understanding
of cannabis botany itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were your thoughts be on this
ongoing debate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think context is important here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we're talking about just,
you know, like if we're talking about like
[SPEAKER_02]: say a method one PPS, which is essential
oils and I think a little bit of alcohol,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I have no problem with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there is a potential for,
say, neem oils or some really heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: applied essential oils to clog the
stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stomata, especially if you're using them
in succession, like you just, one
[SPEAKER_02]: essential oil spray after another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's a potential for
buildup and possible stomata blockage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if your IPM practices were
such that you're hitting it with an
[SPEAKER_02]: essential oil on day one, and so maybe day
three, doing like an aloe rinse on your
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves or whatever as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those, if you're practicing your IPM
in that fashion, I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: drastically going to reduce the
possibility of that happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if you went with kind of a
commercially produced oil product,
[SPEAKER_02]: those tend to be really light in the oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be your DIY guys that might
go a little heavy with the oils and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot, and they could run into potential
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think adding a rinse is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have been that place myself when I
was more of a rookie than I am now,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's like, well, if it says this
much is good, if I add three times that
[SPEAKER_01]: amount, it's going to be triple strength,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, it doesn't really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like most of these ideas that we're
talking about, it's about balance,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or moderation is what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moderation, so yeah, if you're going to
use these foliars, use them in moderation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't plan on leaning on them to do all
the lifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to add than subtract in
situations like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've overdone it, especially with
foliar feeding or with IPM or even like if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're feeding some kind of bottled
nutrient regime, you always want to start
[SPEAKER_02]: with less because it's easier to add the
things that maybe you didn't get in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time than it is to kind of take it
back once you've applied it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's way hard to take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much everybody has been in the
situation where they're late into bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get pest infestation at the worst
possible time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, if you've got a clean room,
if you've got IPM plants planted,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are doing foliars in vegetative
state, if you're doing all of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: your likelihood should be very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, sometimes bad things happen to
good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to get an infestation,
let's just pick spider mites, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: give whatever example most appropriate to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something like that in week,
say four, where you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a lot of these sprays because it'll
mess with the taste of the flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: then could potentially risk molds then
because the flowers will be getting wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your go-to solutions at that
point where everything is so limited,
[SPEAKER_01]: our options?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think if nobody wants to
be in that position and at some,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to kind of just gauge how severe
your infestation is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beautiful thing about this
situation is that if you've had good
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, like you were saying,
up to four weeks and you just got kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: an incidental exposure, that could be
pretty easily fixed with a heavy dose of
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much your only go-to in this
instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're at week four and you have a
severe infestation with webbing and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot, you messed up somewhere along the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some serious user error.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if at week four you've got just kind of
a light little hotspot in your grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: things to consider are hitting it with a
very heavy dose of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities or really like very hungry
predators or just kind of rooting that
[SPEAKER_02]: spot out and cutting it out and cutting
your losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's one or two plants in the back
of your greenhouse or one or two plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: one of your beds, it might be worth it to
just kind of cut your losses, get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tend to want to throw live stuff at
it and try my luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned the beneficials
because I've become a big fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year was the first year that I
used them heavily from veg all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through the end with three different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any pest issues this year,
which was like astonishing and fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you find that your companion
plants, especially the trap plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: were also attracting your beneficials or
were you able to choose trap plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were more interested, that the pests were
more interested in them than any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials you were using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that any time that I've had that
experience where I've seen it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: clover, we took really quick and decisive
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we didn't really, don't give it much
time to observe whether it liked the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis more or what are the predators
had more of an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first sign of any kind of nonsense,
we just throw an obscene amount of bugs at
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that every time has done the trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that I would love to be
able to do a no-spray IPM on the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that no-spray IPM is really the
most ideal way to go about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can just focus on your
foliage and your feeding and know that
[SPEAKER_02]: your pests are handled by the predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, a lot of times like in
our situation at Freshwater Farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're surrounded by hemp fields and we're
also surrounded by other cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it became really apparent to us in
our first cycle that we were not gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get away with a no-spray IPM
because the influx of bad guys was just
[SPEAKER_02]: more than we could throw bugs at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that if you were by yourself over
there, that you would not attract nearly
[SPEAKER_01]: as many from all the dirty ass farms
around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got no problem with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's just kind of a
natural thing that happens too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that many cannabis plants in one
area, they just send a signal out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bugs just know like, oh, in that
building, there's a bunch or there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge hemp field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everywhere in the area, they're just
kind of migrating that way and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: find their way into the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we were talking
about water and how between all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plants and the blue mats that
your water requirements are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wondered what your thoughts were about
nutrients because for folks new to
[SPEAKER_01]: companion planning, it's a pretty common
pushback for them to say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: my nutrients are really expensive and I
don't want them to be all taken up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually start with, hmm, what nutrients
are you buying that are so expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But to their point, I was curious if you
find that to what degree the companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plants swipe nutrients from the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how does that impact your feeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good consideration to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had the same thoughts when I was
first getting into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we as a whole don't really
understand the vastness of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: available in the soil and in a properly
amended soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in my situation, I know that Tad
would keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always recommends that we re-amend
every cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really value that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I value his opinion, but I really hold
fast to my minimalist approach and we do
[SPEAKER_02]: it every other cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're still finding that even though
we're waiting six months, we're basically
[SPEAKER_02]: re-amending our beds twice a year,
that there's plenty to go around in that
[SPEAKER_02]: six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just kind of have faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have faith in the process and
the system and know that those plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are uptaking some minerals and some
nutrients, but they're also gonna give it
[SPEAKER_02]: back in that cycling process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you were cutting down your
cover crop and then fermenting it and
[SPEAKER_02]: applying it back to your soil as a T,
you can capture a percentage of those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that the plants took and give it
back or just allow the plant to give it
[SPEAKER_02]: back when you go through your die-off
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going further down that line of
thought, when people ask me about the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that the companion plants take
up and it's taking away from my cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, what I normally tell them is if you
are going to go to the point of having
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plants and to be feeding the
whole bed a natural diet, whatever you are
[SPEAKER_01]: out financially for the nutrients that the
companion plants are going to uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will end up receiving far,
far more from the additional
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients and nutrients that are
germane to the soil that will be created
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got all these additional
plants and the mycelium that comes with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are all the additional microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may be putting in some nutrients
and those plants may be taking them up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the symphony, like you were talking
about, will actually cause far more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients than you paid to put in the
backs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over unity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like in the old days when I used
to own a brick and mortar hydroponic shop
[SPEAKER_02]: in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing we would always say is if
you're in here spending $1,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: you shouldn't feel terrible because that
$1,000 is going to earn you $10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a similar thought process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to sacrifice a little,
but in the bigger picture, you get more in
[SPEAKER_02]: the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really, really well put.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along that same vein, my favorite part
of polyculture is the interplay of the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots of the different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my science knowledge is growing,
but I would still call it somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when people say any justifiably
evolved technology is indistinguishable
[SPEAKER_01]: from magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, soil science since I consider
myself still a novice, at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get down a level of a detail and then
it's just magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my favorite parts is the
interplay of roots and mycelium through
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil and the rhizosphere speaking,
these networks where they're moving around
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and they're sending signals
about pests that are on the other side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of some reason, the symphony,
as you put it, it really seems to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the thriving nature of the entirety of the
bed, even though this is mostly invisible
[SPEAKER_01]: to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, I know that you spend a lot
of time with your beds and you've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point, decades of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the cultivator, over time,
can you sense any of that activity below
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Below the soil, since you're with them for
such long periods of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, without sounding too
starry-eyed, there's definitely something
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens when you feel like you've
achieved homeostasis, when everything is
[SPEAKER_02]: just firing on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this kind of iridescence that
happens with your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lipid layers on your cannabis are
thick and beautiful and it's when you show
[SPEAKER_02]: people pictures, they're just like,
oh my gosh, supreme health.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that feeling you get when you look at
a plant that's just, you can tell that its
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum genetic potential is expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a feeling that happens and I
think that's what calls a lot of us to
[SPEAKER_02]: this living soil process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed a lot of us to kind of put our
ego aside because it's really hard,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, to take credit for the cannabis
that I grow in these systems because I
[SPEAKER_02]: literally don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally plant them in and observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll lollipop, I'll thin a little bit,
but I'm not in there fussing over things
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm just observing and that's when
having the trust in the process and having
[SPEAKER_02]: faith in that magic that happens because
I'm no soil scientist, I'm a high school
[SPEAKER_02]: graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a trade school for audio
engineering, so I'm ProTool certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea about the soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know what has worked and from what
my very basic understanding and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: your actual soil scientists themselves
like Dr. Lane Ingham and Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be the first ones to tell you that
they are only at a 10% knowledge of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of magic that needs to
be deciphered there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you say that you don't mess
with it much and then earlier on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you said that you're kind of past your
days of bothering about pH because of how
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pH is going to be correct and stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious where you fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: How regularly do you test your soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I wanted to tighten
up on my regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: At my home-grow, I've never tested my
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad has been really wanting me to get soil
samples in just to get the data because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over three years on these beds and if
the plants look like they're doing good,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not fussing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we're on this commercial level
with freshwater, we're going to start to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement at least twice a year soil
samples and soil analysis so we can see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's being consumed, what's being left
behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe move forward with a more
conscientious amending as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing a basic amending kit that's got a
little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil analysis is crucial for data and
crucial for moving forward and keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: costs down and those kinds of things
because now that we're not black market or
[SPEAKER_02]: medical, we're really concerned with cost
of goods produced and all these types of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So analysis and data is crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking another step down this science
path, in medical days in each state before
[SPEAKER_01]: the heavy regulation and taxing comes
along, we all had a lot more flexibility
[SPEAKER_01]: in our grow locations and so places that I
have worked and places that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: visited, very often I would see two
stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be a Dab station and then
there would be a Science station and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd have a rig on one side and then
they have a microscope on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was curious, clearly you can't have
the Dab station anymore under the new
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, but perhaps you are the kind
of guy who keeps a microscope station in
[SPEAKER_01]: case maybe to check out your bugs or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just curious if you keep a
microscope in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have your little USB 400 times scope
that you see lots of folks have and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that sometime in the next six months
to a year, I'm definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in taking some actual courses
on microscopy because Elaine Ingham has
[SPEAKER_02]: some really good courses and I'd like to
get into that because I think that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons why I don't like
doing aerated compost teas because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what you're getting really
until you can get in there and look at
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're actually cultivating in that
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been hesitant to go down that
route simply because my skill set just
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't allow for me to know exactly what
was happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very, very valuable skill
to have and it's something that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going to be putting into my
future toolkit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it cool that so much what I'll just
throw in one big basket and called soil
[SPEAKER_01]: science, that this stuff is becoming so
much more available to all of us when
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis had to be in the dark and in the
prohibition days and even farther back
[SPEAKER_01]: when all we could find was a column or two
in high times magazines in the stone age,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays though, not only can we talk more
publicly about soil cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil science as it relates to cannabis,
but now like you mentioned Elaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take her classes, you can take her
online classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that great traveling science
classes that Joshua Rutherford is running.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Organicregenerativecannabis.com I think,
but he's taking these soil scientists and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking them across the country so people
in Michigan and Maine can get the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a game changer I think from
everybody from the high commercial level
[SPEAKER_01]: who certainly needs it, but really so many
patient and just enthusiastic home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: are diving into the soil science,
which always brings me back to the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: that really cannabis cultivation is an
entryway to all sorts of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love what Joshua's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to his first one last year in
Portland and he's got such a great vision
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm really proud to know him and happy
that he's doing that because you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting time because we
have a lot of people we touched on it
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, a lot of people that are just
kind of sick of the system as it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: as it's been presented and are realizing
that there's a safer way to produce your
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine or to produce your cannabis and
not have to sacrifice yields or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're producing a safer, higher quality
medicine and it's a better product than
[SPEAKER_02]: you would otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, I've seen lots of people go
from cannabis and now they've got
[SPEAKER_02]: hugelkultur veggie beds and they're taking
this living soil idea and bringing it once
[SPEAKER_02]: again back to the old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we grew before commercial
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people just really reclaiming our
past and there's this kind of maybe this
[SPEAKER_02]: inherent nostalgia that happens when we
participate in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to go back and fix the URL
that I put out because I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua is out there listening to this
going, you gave the wrong domain because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't planning on mentioning it,
so it wasn't in my notes, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerativeorganiccannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing four or five of these that are
going across the entire US and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing people like Kevin Jodry and Lang
Ingham with him across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and take our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Joshua Steensland,
[SPEAKER_01]: lead cultivator at Freshwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become distilled only with steam,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you stack those terpenes to make your
blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_01]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_01]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_01]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: True terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to shapingfire.com board slash True
Terpenes to find out more, or click on the
[SPEAKER_01]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty in the customers you do have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and you're not really ready to hire
someone full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Blunt, Kirsten Nelson and her team are
focused on improving your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_01]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_01]: of sale, whether it be online or
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what she did recently for
MoonTime Medicinals in Humboldt County at
[SPEAKER_01]: MoonTimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean that they bought my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on four
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and every single time they have done more
than they've promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: on results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: making you a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just doesn't happen every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_01]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_01]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Blunt Branding, marketing that makes you
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Lowes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is Joshua Steensland,
lead cultivator at Freshwater Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua, in addition to all this
groundbreaking polyculture stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing, and the fact that you're
doing it indoors is even more
[SPEAKER_01]: mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also no-till, and no-till is
becoming exceptionally popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just take a moment and explain a
little bit about how you're implementing
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till in your floor by eight beds,
and what your planting and harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: processes look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no-till has really become kind of a
buzzword as of late over the past couple
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I think of no-till, I literally
think of not tilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I try to, when I plant my
crop plants, my cannabis, I will plant
[SPEAKER_02]: them in the ground in as small a container
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can take my cuttings in clone form
as just rooted cubes or rooted cuttings,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put those directly into my beds,
because I don't want to displace any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil that where we were talking
earlier about the fungal components and
[SPEAKER_02]: the bacterial components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to disturb that delicate
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we had one gallon pots,
and we had 24 or 18 plants in a four by
[SPEAKER_02]: eight bed, or even 12 in a four by eight
bed, you're displacing 12 gallons of
[SPEAKER_02]: medium that was in the beds, happy,
doing its thing, and you're just tearing
[SPEAKER_02]: it up and displacing it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, ultimately, it's not the end
of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your beds will recover, but I think over
time, there's this cumulative benefit that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens to really just allowing that soil
structure to remain intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you haven't disturbed areas
of the bed for over three years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can imagine the strength of that
communication network that resides in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like, oh, we've got all this
mycelium superhighways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why on earth would we break that up and
then start over every year when we already
[SPEAKER_01]: have all that maturity in the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, so if your optimum situation is
just to create a little opening and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: bare rooted start in there, how do you go
about amending your beds without
[SPEAKER_01]: disturbing the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tend to just top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, when I amend, I once again,
I tend to under amend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's been recommended that you
do about 14 pounds of dry nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals per four by eight bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do about seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I do half of what's been
recommended from Tad at Kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've been doing quite well with
that, once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just top dress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top dress and maybe sprinkle it a little
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happens is the cover crop
will kind of grow over it, and the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: life just kind of pulls it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that actually speaks to my next
question, which was how do you actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, all right, so let's say that
today you harvest and you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start a new cycle in just a couple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of people will do is top dress
and then kind of flood it with water to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the nutrients to soak in more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you've got a really wet bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you need to let that even out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like your idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you are using less top dress over a
wider area, watering regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the idea that the soil comes up
and sucks it down, it takes it itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of the visualization I
have is that really just like the worms
[SPEAKER_02]: will make their way up to the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll know that the kelp is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crab meal is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll come up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The process of them making their way to
the surface and then heading back down
[SPEAKER_02]: again is going to pull some of that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just the natural microbial
activity is going to just break it down
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll get kind of a precipitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about the beginning of the
cycle for no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk the end of the cycle of
no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does your no-till harvest look
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do a dry out or any kind of weird
stressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say weird because people do it
and they like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for a living soil bed,
I don't like to stress temperature stress
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants because I don't want to affect
the soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for obvious reasons, I don't want to
dry out or overstress that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with no-till, it's literally just
cutting the plant right at the soil level
[SPEAKER_02]: and then proceed with your dry and cure
methods as normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that is in my particular
methodology, in my minimalist kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: water only thought process or our
methodology is we just will re-amend at
[SPEAKER_02]: that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we have no cash crop in the bed at
that time, we've harvested, then I'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: my re-amendment if it's after the second
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll let it sit for about a week
before I transplant the clones in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just kind of to ease my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like the nutrients amendments
that we use are necessarily hot or would
[SPEAKER_02]: be a detriment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of like to give the soil time
to acclimate to its new influx of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and minerals before plugging the
plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you pull the root ball and plant in its
place or do you plant beside the former
[SPEAKER_01]: root ball?
[SPEAKER_02]: We plant beside the former root ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, we don't want to disturb that
kind of that delicate infrastructure in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the roots become worm food and they
also leave air cavities in there for
[SPEAKER_02]: aeration and water to flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a really good thing to leave in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just drove by a hemp field recently and
they had 15 or 20 people out there digging
[SPEAKER_02]: the root balls of their hemp crop out and
piling it in a big pile and burning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, no, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are you wasting man hours and
labor, you're wasting a valuable resource
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're depleting your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, it pains me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was medical grade hemp instead
of fiber hemp, there's actually really
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable medicinal properties in those
root balls as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there's just still a lot of
funky cultivation practices going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't done enough volume to have an
informed opinion on this or experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plant next to the old root ball,
will that root ball break down and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycle back into the soil within
one cycle or will it be there for a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the delicate parts of the root ball
will go away pretty quick, as you can
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the finer roots and whatnot,
those tend to go really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that those are gone from
after the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never done, I've never sliced
into my soil to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be really interesting to
kind of see, but all I can judge is by
[SPEAKER_02]: what the stem and stocky material that's
above the soil line that I've looked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the stuff that's left
after clipping, it sticks around and is
[SPEAKER_02]: visible for about six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you went in and touched it,
it would be spongy and you could break it
[SPEAKER_02]: apart really super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my guess is that the stuff that's below
the soil is long gone after your second
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, after the second cycle
post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that's above that has access to
air that tends to stay around a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you touched it or it was stepped
on, or anything like that, it would just
[SPEAKER_02]: be nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would break apart to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in preparation for chatting with you,
I spent a lot of time on your YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel, which is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the videos informs this next
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raw inputs like kelp and crab meal could
not be eaten directly by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of two things either has to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either you have to purchase a pre-digested
nutrient in a bottle, or you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce the whole kelp or crab meal or
whatever and give the microbes time to
[SPEAKER_01]: digest it, which will then be picked up by
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your views on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which do you prefer and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I clearly prefer the
amending.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the plant-ready soluble
bottled nutrients simply because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not allowing the plant to regulate its own
uptake at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have a soluble plant-ready
nutrient, the plant's just going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: it up because it's designed to be absorbed
readily by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically, my very rudimentary
understanding is that the root exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: play less of a part when you're dealing
with those kind of water-soluble
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetics or even like a water-soluble
organic nutrient that's just plant-ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: This came up because there was a question
in the community of whether no-till beds
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this came about basically from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a group of folks who think that
all plants need to be flushed and that
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you check the runoff of a
no-till bed, it's got three or 400 parts
[SPEAKER_02]: per million, that means that your plants
aren't flushed properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's where that kind of
video came from was me kind of addressing
[SPEAKER_02]: that aspect that a raw kelp is a lot
different in the soil than a water-soluble
[SPEAKER_02]: plant-ready nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I definitely am on the side of the
fence that raw nutrients and minerals that
[SPEAKER_02]: you allow the soil biology to process and
have their exchange with the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get your maximum genetic
expression, your maximum terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just based on my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cultivated for 15, 16 years with
synthetic nutrients and organic bottled
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and plant-ready nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second I switched to living soil,
there was a marked improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of the product was
outrageously good and I was never turning
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a really good case too for not
swapping out your soil every cycle too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the older days, it was like,
oh, we want fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays that seems so foolhardy
because we spend all this time and effort
[SPEAKER_01]: building this rhizosphere and all these
healthy microbes in the mycelium and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you throw it out and you're like,
ah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nowadays with living soil,
you not only are giving your microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: say for example, kelp, but they may not
process it all during this cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might get some advantages from
that kelp next cycle because you've kept
[SPEAKER_01]: the same soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other benefit of this
process is that you're allowing the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and in one of my YouTube videos,
the No-Till Talks series that I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: did, which was based on a lot of people
just asking me to explain my minimalist
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of water-only approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like to think of that interaction
between the soil and plant as this sacred
[SPEAKER_02]: union.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when the plant is interacting with
a healthy microbiome in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's asking it's calling for only the
stuff that it needs and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes back to that why we don't
have to flush is because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: overfeeding itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant doesn't have a capacity to
overfeed itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a highly finely tuned mechanism in
itself that allows it to only ask for what
[SPEAKER_02]: it needs and only receive that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's never like an over,
it doesn't overfeed itself nitrogen ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you allow that natural kind of
process that was designed in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it evolved in the plant and you're
not bypassing that, I think that's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the contributing factors to getting plants
that so clearly are exhibiting maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their genetic potential is fully expressed
because you're allowing those little micro
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms in the plant to play itself
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put it elegantly like that,
it really points out how the soil has an
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence and a heart and a strategy
for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly so long as we can set up the
soil to succeed, it will do its work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of changing gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen from the Fantastic Freshwater
Farms Instagram, which unfortunately was
[SPEAKER_01]: deactivated, but we've got a new one we'll
give you the address for in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Freshwater Farms uses LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your experience been using LED?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, I was a really hard
sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been an HID cultivator from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over 20 years and I just had never had
any personal experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't seen any flowers grown with LED
and having been a former owner of two
[SPEAKER_02]: brick and mortar kind of indoor grow
shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am intimately aware of the vast quantity
of snake oil that permeates the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and this kind of no R&D products that hit
the market where the consumers end up
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming the research and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really, really weary of stepping
into this realm and looking towards other
[SPEAKER_02]: large scale cultivators that just simply
never, even to this date, haven't made the
[SPEAKER_02]: transition because they're skeptical and
weary of the technology and whether it has
[SPEAKER_02]: arrived or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was extremely, extremely trepidatious
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked to Growmouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're familiar with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of a really popular DIY LED guy
who's working with chilled LED now and I
[SPEAKER_02]: really value his opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I reached out to him when I
connected with Mike at Freshwater Farms
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were discussing how we wanted to
go about setting up this facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And long story short, he put me in contact
with the current light company that we use
[SPEAKER_02]: now, Lighting Company for LED and it took
about six months of talks and visiting
[SPEAKER_02]: places that were using them and just
getting assurances from folks that I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: were using similar technologies and
getting the results they were getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was enough for me to move forward and
try it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that being said, we're really impressed
with LED tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's arrived.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting to the point where we have
lights where you have independent spectral
[SPEAKER_02]: tuning abilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're allowed to tune your reds,
your yellows and your blue whites
[SPEAKER_02]: independently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually affect how your plant
grows, the nodal spacing, the lateral
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, all those type of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a bit of a learning curve for
folks like me who's just used to hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: an HID really high and letting it fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a bit of a learning curve on
my part, but I really think that the
[SPEAKER_02]: chance for LEDs to kind of overtake the
HID lights in the industry, it's not if,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's when, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing yields that are three pounds,
two and a half to three pounds per 700
[SPEAKER_02]: watts of LED fixture, which is pretty
impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're not sacrificing terpenes,
we're not sacrificing any of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think as we refine our abilities with
the lights, they'll start to be a greater
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciation of what the LEDs can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be some people out there
who are begging that you name drop the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of light that you decided to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want to plug your lighting
folks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going with the Progro Tech EV700s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a really great company and the
light that they have, the fixture that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have and all of our research,
we went around and I'm not going to name
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that we didn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we saw and talked to many,
many LED lighting manufacturers and they
[SPEAKER_02]: all seemed so cheap and they seemed so
flimsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this unit from Progro Tech is really
durable, sturdy, it's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: waterproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of benefits to this fixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend people check them
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we wrap up, Joshua, I want to
give you a nice big open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a fishing expedition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have folks with a depth of experience
like you on the show and sometimes I can
[SPEAKER_01]: put together a question path like I did
for today, but I'm really curious,
[SPEAKER_01]: what did I not ask you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know that you are excited
about that people in the scene just aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about yet and I'm not experienced
enough to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to open it up for you and
say, what are you excited about that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should know about that you want to break
down for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think there's anything
really that you haven't touched on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do think that what I personally have
been excited about over the past six
[SPEAKER_02]: months or so is diving into biodynamic
cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in looking into that, it's almost like
thinking of handling your soils in a
[SPEAKER_02]: homeopathic fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, think very small, powerful,
kind of, it sounds starry-eyed again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like you're dealing with
energy almost more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's things like the horn manure and
horn silica where they take manure and cow
[SPEAKER_02]: manure and pack it into a cow's horn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's specifically a cow's horn.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tried to use other horns like goat
horns and ibex and it just doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll bury it for the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happens is this
transmutation takes place and you're left
[SPEAKER_02]: in the springtime when you dig these
things up, you're left with this ball of
[SPEAKER_02]: rubbery, humic material that's pleasant to
smell, doesn't smell like manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a highly valuable resource for
your soil, for your soil microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use super small quantities of
this to revitalize a very large amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's this horn manure,
there's horn silica where they'll take
[SPEAKER_02]: quartz crystal, grind it up, put it into
the cow horn, bury it in the summertime,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then dig it out and then use it as a
foliar application to help maximize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have in a cloudy day and you
don't have very much light, it'll help
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light that you do have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of really good research
validating a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a couple of the inputs,
the biodynamic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of them and some of them are
pretty strange when you get down into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the science behind it is really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people like wine
producers that are switching to this
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamic cultivation because they've
noticed the difference in their grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they're more wild tasting and the
more rich and the flavor profile is very
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to kind of take this into
the cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part, putting the compost in the
horn and burying it, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, that sounds different and
unique, but I can see how there could be
[SPEAKER_01]: some subtle science that we haven't
learned yet there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then your second example, you're like
grinding crystals and I could almost hear
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody in the audience kind of together
roll our eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm not so cocky or
full of myself that I think that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: all the ways that the world works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people are getting qualitative,
if not quantitative, positive results and
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of science supports the energetics of
crystals, well, all right, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things that science hasn't
unearthed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but holy smokes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hesitant to talk about it for that
very reason, because it immediately puts
[SPEAKER_02]: you in this class of like starry eyed
hippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of like, you know, well,
that guy's really like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's on one or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look into it, Steiner,
the guy who developed this was was no was
[SPEAKER_02]: no hack.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really was a really intelligent man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very gifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start looking into some of
this biodynamic stuff, and you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: past that kind of weird feeling,
it's like we were talking about earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: with the soil, like what what looks like
magic to us, there's science behind it,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just haven't found it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's what we're dealing
with when we're talking about biodynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm no expert on just now starting to
kind of wet my whistle in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's wildly and insanely fascinating
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're clearly a soil adventurer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so so this is this is novel and
kind of weird and potentially works.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a recipe that like will
totally attract you personally as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing that I had ever heard
about biodynamic really up till today,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see biodynamic on bottles of
wine, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but you know, you'll get people
arguing back and forth on forums like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Probiotic Farmers Alliance on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and people will talk about either
popping their seeds or harvesting with
[SPEAKER_01]: different moon cycles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't I don't personally have an
opinion one way or another, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know enough to have an informed
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is that part of your bigger picture
with attraction to biodynamics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you are you popping seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the moon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't drank the Kool-Aid that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think I think that, look,
the moon clearly has an effect on bodies
[SPEAKER_02]: of water on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you think about how it affects
the tides, you know, and you think that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are a very large percentage water,
the plants have a large percentage of
[SPEAKER_02]: water in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would stand to reason that if the moon
is affecting large bodies of water,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the ocean with tides, that there's
some kind of effect on anything that is
[SPEAKER_02]: water based on this globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I can get with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can I can I can see where they're going
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't gone that far down the
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can incorporate some of the
biodynamic principles without having to go
[SPEAKER_02]: that far into it and planting and
harvesting according to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: astrological signs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once again, who are we to kind of say
that there's nothing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just we simply just don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just shrug our shoulders and be
like, oh, that sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until we actually practically apply
it, if there's we can't really formulate
[SPEAKER_02]: that opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do know is that there's lots of
people who do utilize this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of commercial farms operate under
these biodynamic principles and they crush
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're they're vegetables and
fruits are routinely more nutrient and
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral dense than conventional,
even organic practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something there's some
something that that's there that deserves
[SPEAKER_02]: a closer look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad that you were willing to go
there with me, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that was a really interesting
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so before we sign off, I want to give
you props because it just came out this
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recording this the week before
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of your photographs was while it
did not win, you got information that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were a finalist, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I placed in the top 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really kind of a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that they were doing the photo
contest and I was like, oh, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I'll just throw something in and
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really didn't give it much thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just picked a photo that I really
thought was was great and sent it in with
[SPEAKER_02]: no expectation of any acknowledgment
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got back and said that I was in
the top 30 out of a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt I felt humbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, it's nice to get those kind of
unexpected kudos, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, Joshua, thanks so much for being on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you have a wealth of
experience, but you're just totally a
[SPEAKER_01]: delightful dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to talking with you
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so if any of you want to get in contact
with Joshua, or just follow along his
[SPEAKER_01]: totally awesome Instagram, you can get

is S-T-E-E-N-S-L-A-N-D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua Steensland, all one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, even though his farm's his
farm's IG got removed, they are reset up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's only like 15 or 20 photos
there somewhere so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to want to follow that
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's freshwater farms and then two
underscores.
