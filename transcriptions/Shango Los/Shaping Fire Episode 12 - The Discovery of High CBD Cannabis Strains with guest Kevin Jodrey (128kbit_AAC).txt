[SPEAKER_01]: Oral history has been important to humans
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking our histories to each other is
how we learn about nature, each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: and where we all come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an essential part of being human and
passing our history onto the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in the internet age, oral history
takes place less around a campfire and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead happens more often with the aid of
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: On today's episode, we're going to take
part in that oral tradition and share the
[SPEAKER_01]: story of how high CBD strains began in
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like lightning striking twice in the same
place, in the early 2000s, one line of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics bred by legendary cannabis
breeder, Lawrence Ringo, was showing high
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, a strain startled
everybody by testing high in CBD at the
[SPEAKER_01]: spannivus competition in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two sets of genetics soon came
together in Northern California and
[SPEAKER_01]: American CBD was born.

[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Kevin Jodry,
founder of Wonderland Nursery in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland is easily the most important
cannabis genetics hub in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experts come from every part of the world
to meet with Kevin and share genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques, and stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin was also a close friend of Lawrence
Ringo and was present to see CBD arise in
[SPEAKER_01]: America firsthand and help it along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Kevin's going to tell us about
those first two years of CBD and how these
[SPEAKER_01]: early cultivars made their way into the
hands of breeders growers, and patients
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, pleasure to have me on the show,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so glad you could make the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's like get right into
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I've heard you tell
parts of this story before and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to, you know, hear it for myself,
but also to share it with the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the small part of the story that I know
is that, you know, CBD coming to the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States or starting to be focused on
there in Northern California was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: happening two ways at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friend, Lawrence Ringo, was starting
to find CBD in some of the lines he was
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then at the same time, there were
these seeds that came from spanidus
[SPEAKER_01]: through pure analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were some seeds coming from
Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take us back to those early days and
explain how, you know, everything got
[SPEAKER_01]: started up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, when you're talking about
CBD, if you just go back to 2007,
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists believe that the CBD had been
bred out of cannabis for psychoactive use
[SPEAKER_00]: and that there was this belief that there
was nothing over, you know, maybe 2% CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: in existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harborside in 2008 funded Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They created their own laboratory and they
detected something called Stinky Purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: which put them at 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, they started saying,
hey, wait a second, CBD does exist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time about 2008, a guy named
Wade Lauder created Harlequin and
[SPEAKER_00]: Harlequin was basically a one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he used genetics that he had and he
created one of the first CBD clones and he
[SPEAKER_00]: released it through Harborside and they
started to put it out in small quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, release 10 and 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that same period in time, you have two
individuals that are doing breeding and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was Jaime from Resin Seeds out in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Lawrence Ringo in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Spain genetic group, we're going to
call that Kanatonic, and everything coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of Lawrence Ringo was based off of the
Sawa Tsunami that he created.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two individuals, completely
unrelated, completely unconnected,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them started to work on lines that
were CBD dominant, but neither one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think knew it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cutting that they worked on in Spain
came up at span with the 5% number and it
[SPEAKER_00]: became very attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a doctor named William Courtney,
another doctor out of Luxembourg,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jaime from Resin Seeds all got
together and said, hey, if we could bring
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds into Northern California,
we could work a breeding project and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if we can pull out some really high
CBD with no THC, because at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was believed to be a loophole in
terms of cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get below the THC numbers that
are mandated by the DEA, individuals could
[SPEAKER_00]: then produce this almost as if it was
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Courtney was determined to find
these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He believed that CBD was one of the
missing components in individuals' health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, driving it from a medical
direction, working with Jaime from Resin
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, they bring the varietals over to
Northern California and they bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: over to a guy named Dreddy Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dreddy Aaron's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreddy Aaron takes all the Kanatonic seed
stock and he grows it all out and he pulls
[SPEAKER_00]: out a bunch of different phenos,
but the most famous phenom that got pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it is ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this 18 to 1 incredible phenotype
was pulled out by Dreddy Aaron and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was this huge struggle over what to do
with the clone because they believed that
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone had value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Courtney realized what he was
working with and he wanted to benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which he should because that's not a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is doing good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd like to get paid for this work
because he's doing so much research on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were trying to understand how do
you get paid off a CBD when at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody would take CBD pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't even sell CBD to a dispensary
because no one knew what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't get you high, it had no
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no understanding of it,
but we understood on a human level that
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD had incredible value and that once
the patients got a hold of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would really start to do something for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Dreddy Aaron willingly took that
ACDC cut and he gave it to me and at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time I was the cultivation director for
the Humble Patient Resource Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcata and I was running this large
operation with this large clone
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution operation and I took that
ACDC cut and we started to propagate it
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it into the public's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was where ACDC really originated
and started making it into the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's the progenitor for,
if you take a look at Charlotte's Web,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you DNA Charlotte's Web through Phylos,
you'll see that the Charlotte's Web and
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC get connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I doubt that Charlotte's Web is prior
to ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could say that Charlotte's Web is
more than likely a derivative of ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ACDC really created this massive super
CBD, ultra-low THC phenomenon that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of the story is that the
guy that released it, Dreddy Aaron,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't try to hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine what this is worth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking about the CBD empire
and this guy willingly released this on
[SPEAKER_00]: his own and through humanitarian desire
because he realized that as much as he
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to get paid too, he realized
that if we were trying to use money to
[SPEAKER_00]: dictate the pace of the cutting moving
into the world, it would completely slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down and actually probably destroy the
progress that was about to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made this incredible decision,
releases ACDC into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to have super high CBD,
super low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that exact time that this little
phenomenon's going on, Lawrence Ringo is
[SPEAKER_00]: working on lines over in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he was working on was he had
grabbed, and I had to go to Kat and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to her because I had got this a little
messed up when I was talking to Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, we all hung out and
we worked together, but there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went and got a clarify from Kat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where Ringo really got this going was
he went and got seeds from Mark Emery and
[SPEAKER_00]: he got New York City diesel and Sauer
diesel and he bred them together and it
[SPEAKER_00]: formed something called the double diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he ran the double diesel for a
while and at some point he picked up a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone called the Ferrari cut from some
lagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took the Ferrari and he went back
into the double diesel and he went back
[SPEAKER_00]: into a Sauer diesel and he rolled it
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up coming out with something
that he called the tsunami that he really
[SPEAKER_00]: liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ringo had had a back injury as a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was like maybe a young teenager
and he hurt his back messing with his
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's always had this back problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was looking for cannabis that
allowed him to function and have pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relief, but also have some good mental
euphoria so that you're uplifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bred himself something that was
really solid for him as a varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about that same time all this is
occurring, Steep Hill popped out in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the same time Samantha Miller from
Pure Analytics popped out her lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Samantha Miller and Ringo hook up,
which was an incredible union because when
[SPEAKER_00]: they teamed up the work that occurred from
that point forward was just ungodly in CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Samantha and Jason, the team from Pure
Analytics hooked up with Ringo and they
[SPEAKER_00]: tested his Sauer tsunami and it came out
at 11% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he had seven, yeah,
it was high at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had about seven or eight other
varieties at that same time that were also
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD dom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was, like I said, you're in
the 2007, 2008 time.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get to 2011, so three years
after this introduction, Ringo releases
[SPEAKER_00]: the first truly stabilized line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when someone defines stabilized line
in plant breeding or in plant terms,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means four phenotypical
distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I breed it, I'm gonna get
four very specific phenotypes out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Ringo was able to create a one
in four CBD dominant line, he created the
[SPEAKER_00]: first CBD reproducible line, which was his
Sauer-Sue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ringo was taking his tsunami line
and he started laying it into everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that he could find that was CBD dominant
and other varieties to increase turp
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was working with Samantha Miller
and what Samantha Miller had pioneered was
[SPEAKER_00]: predicated testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Samantha Miller was the first lab
where you could go and find out your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid levels of the plant in
vegetative form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed, I and Ringo were friends,
but I went after THC numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was after higher rec numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was after high CBD numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used predicated testing to go after
different directions in our breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used it to find exceptionally high
THC ratio, exceptionally high THC overall
[SPEAKER_00]: level males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ringo was looking for these opposites,
exceptionally high CBD dom males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Samantha Miller, through her
predicated work, allowed this process to
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly speed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went from having two varieties that
were over 15, 16% CBD to the next year
[SPEAKER_00]: having over 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking of a breeding speed that
was just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that CBD no longer existed
to having now we have thousands of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant varieties in less than eight
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's such a fast rise once it got
kicked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a botany point of view,
was THC and high levels of CBD in the
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally occurring land races and then
guys like you who were breeding for THC
[SPEAKER_01]: were intentionally breeding out the CBD so
that the THC was more dominant or was CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: just not in any sense real significance in
the material you were working with at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting these genetics created like
this infusion of CBD into your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing with the thing with CBD is
from my own my own hunting through gene
[SPEAKER_00]: lines is what I found is that CBD really
exists in Pakistan and portions of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe say southern Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go through those gene lines
is where you start to see incredible CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always theorize that the people
who lived along equatorial to 20 on the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator, all those cerebral lines,
they they didn't need CBD, which what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call it, you know, medicine, they needed
cerebral uplifting because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: living in a beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you live in between the 20 and
the 30 on the parallel, you're in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most intense climate on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people are typically the hash
producing regions, desert regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you see the CBD genetics,
because you'd say that those individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: choose cannabis that makes them feel good
for their situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us in the United States,
we have all these gene pools that come
[SPEAKER_00]: into the US we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predominantly, you see all THC modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we started to tap into
anything that had Pakistani gene lines is
[SPEAKER_00]: where we started to see the CBD components
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD reduces the ability for THC to
really lift you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for high CBD in a recreational line,
it's the absolute worst thing you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were trying to drive CBD levels down
through perception, because we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab at first to prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we started to really get into
labs, being able to analyze and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, we started to see that within the
entire population of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific populations was CBD
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was based off of the cultivators
who were growing the strains to suit the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so individuals historically have
always cultivated cannabis to suit their
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started to really look at the
gene lines, we realized it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cultivated specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the genesis of the lines that
came from Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you said that you were referring
to it as the canatonic, as the
[SPEAKER_01]: cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened in Europe that suddenly
these lines were seen at spannibus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they found their way to Northern
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who was doing that work over
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the irony.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a G13 haze hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did a G13 haze, which is a true
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an extreme dissimilar genetic
material put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that population, you started to
have high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Jaime, Jaime from Resin Seeds,
came over to NorCal with Courtney,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we all hung out for a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jaime was trying to use that mail that
he had to tap into all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics to try to see if he could put CBD
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was hella funny, because at that
time, nobody wanted to touch CBD at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was no market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, none.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people weren't knowing how to use it
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was not only very helpful,
but he was also visionary, seeing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, we're ahead of the curve on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we start educating patients,
they're going to be all over clamoring for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I wouldn't necessarily
say, I mean, Jaime's a bright guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know if he was visionary as
much, because visionary would say he
[SPEAKER_00]: believed CBD was valuable, and he went and
created it, where he went and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, let's go chase a direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really had a cutting that he entered
into a competition, and it came out with
[SPEAKER_00]: these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, holy shit, we didn't
realize the line had this potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, everything we're talking
about is because laboratories exist from
[SPEAKER_00]: this minute forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if laboratories weren't in this
conversation, none of us would have a clue
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that when he entered the
G13 haze into spannibus, he did not know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the high CBD levels, but it was when
it was tested as part of the competition
[SPEAKER_01]: that he got these results and everybody
was blown away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lucky break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look at Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Lawrence wasn't breeding for CBD
in terms of per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, I am breeding for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, shit, we barely knew about the
damn cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, really, we were so
ignorant 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mind-bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just knew what we liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Lawrence knew that this cannabis
made his back feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when we were sitting at the
table in the shop, me, Samantha,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Lawrence, and he was just like,
goddamn, I can't believe I have such high
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD alleles in my lines by the fact that I
chose it because it made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Jaime brought the strains over,
had he made seeds from his cut and he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the seeds, or did he actually
bring his own cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought the male cutting and he brought
seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did he just bring one cut or did he
bring like a handful of cuts in case,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of them didn't make the trip
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: He just brought the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he brought plants, but it was just
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only plant that came over as a plant
form was the male that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else came as seed stock
because the problem with this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, it's a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to see incredible
population dissimilarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was CBD from 20 to THC
zero to the exact opposite, THC 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the kinetonic line was all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go through this massive line to
find anything that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why CBD was so difficult was that
they didn't have the ability to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: males that carried the high CBD allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you couldn't stabilize the trait
until the laboratory really started to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they had the ability to
start driving the direction, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: get more of a consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in four is where we were trying to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kinetonic is still a train wreck
if you breathe into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all over the place and you
have a lot of the phenotypes are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial hemp hay coming out of the haze
line that has some of the worst quality
[SPEAKER_00]: terp profile you could envision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it great for just a super,
you know, an extraction where you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to add a terp or add it to food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people who want to consume it as a
product, you know, a lot of it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the quality of the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where some of the kinetonics
lacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where Lawrence was able to kind
of come in and develop stuff like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss tsunami, where he had these
beautiful orange mandarin terpenes in a 15
[SPEAKER_00]: to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to remember that that
extraction and the labs all kind of touch
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, where they all begin at the exact
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so extraction is really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people weren't extracting CBD eight
years ago, they were smoking it as flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we were doing is we were
chasing through CBD lines to find CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that had the right ratio,
the right total, but also the right terp
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that was palatable because on a
lot of these hemp hay combos, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: taste like shit and nobody wants to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go to our first break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come back, we'll talk more
about how you guys churned through all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds that you were getting to find
the stuff that you wanted to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Kevin Jodry, founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are certified organic, non-GMO and
food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, terpenes from true terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: impurities that degrade your final
product.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Kevin Chaudhary, founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, Kevin, we were
talking about how both Jaime, bringing CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics from Europe, and also there in
Northern California, Lawrence Ringo,
[SPEAKER_01]: had both found CBD in the lines that they
were breeding, very possibly because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the advent of all of this new CBD testing
and the arrival of the first cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once these original CBD strains found
themselves into your hands, what did you
[SPEAKER_01]: all do to turn through all of the
possibility of the genetics to find what
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted to make the spine of the lines
you guys were working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was running a dispensary at that
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go back eight years ago,
everything was still kind of risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're in legal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then things are risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we were doing at that
dispensary was we were banking a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics for these operations where we
would hold copies of stuff so that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was duplicate copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the relationship between William
Courtney and the dispensary was really
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so William Courtney had communicated,
at the same time we did the CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also did all the juicing trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so William Courtney and the dispensary
was pretty connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a good relationship in the
sense that we were trying to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what the value of the CBD stuff was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to remember,
nobody knew anything about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, I can dedicate X amount of
space to this in my shop so we can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold and do the sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really just cracking seeds,
growing them out, and doing the test on
[SPEAKER_00]: them to find which one of these varieties
actually had marketable qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sift was done, there was another
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was another progeny called C6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the C6 was kinetonic 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact number of ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been kinetonic 52.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kinetonic 6 was the exact same numbers
as ACDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an 18 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was probably 20 times the
production level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this massive cactus of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, tremendously terrible turf
profiles, but supernatural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would use the dispensary to churn
through and sift through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we figured out which one of
these phenos had the varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratios we wanted, we were able to
stabilize on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, we didn't know what to do
with keeping ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the desire?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of know now a 1 to 1, and a 2 to
1, and a 10 to 1, and a 20 to 1 kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: give you some really good coverage where
you don't have to have 300 different CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have some basic ratios that give us
relatively changing amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 2 to 1s and the 1 to 1s are giving
us enough THC so that the individual has
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the others, we can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christ, we were trying to hold 50,
60, 70 copies of it, meaning a 1 to 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1.5 to 1, a 2.1, 2.5 to 1, because we
didn't know where the values were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we knew was the ACDC and the
C6 had by far the greatest concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were 18 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we didn't know what
to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we started to release them and
they started to go into the med situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it started to really pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we started to do, too, was we started
to have people come in and access all
[SPEAKER_00]: these CBD lines that we were given out
from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started to see all these people
breeding the CBD lines into their existing
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, meaning we were giving them ACDC
cuts, C6 cuts, Harlequin cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence had provided the Swiss Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had given me, I want to say,
maybe a Harley Sue, a Harlequin Tsunami
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were providing those to people all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, say eight years ago,
the beginning of the CBD to get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where you see all these
hybrids today that are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that push from that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really pretty neat to be able to
sift through this stock and pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the irony of it is that we
just didn't, nowadays, if we could repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: it, if we could repeat the process right
now, where we had a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what it was we were
trying to hunt and look for, it'd be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you do the best you can with the
knowledge you have at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, this was the beginning of the
whole CBD phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really were just trying to
understand, you know, what do you do with
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What works?
[SPEAKER_00]: What levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so new that I'm sure we made plenty
of mistakes in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I could go back and do it
twice, but hey, you got what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, one thing that I think is
important to point out is now a second
[SPEAKER_01]: time the importance of the new cannabis
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, even recognizing that
there was CBD in the cuts, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of having to just, you know,
toke them and figure out how it made your
[SPEAKER_01]: body feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you were testing for the CBD and so
you knew it was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the predictive breeding you were
able to do where, you know, you just had
[SPEAKER_01]: to crack a seed and then in a few weeks
you could test the leaf and you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to run it all the way through flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the amount of time that you saved
sifting through these seeds is just
[SPEAKER_01]: monumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do it constantly now, but there's
no way you can drive a project that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid based accurately through feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been growing for 38 years,
which isn't the longest grower I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but man, that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have to use lab tests to
really understand what it is that's
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting me because when you change the
ratios or you shift the minors,
[SPEAKER_00]: it changes the effect and perception and
all of a sudden you really don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the lab let us have some true
accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we had had, you know, phylos
technology, then it would have allowed us
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand what made up the plant we
were looking at so that we could really
[SPEAKER_00]: have said, hey, wait a second,
go to chase Pakistan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I want CBD, I go after
Pakistani genetics specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even waste my time looking
anywhere else because I know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistani lines, the real Pakistani lines
from Pakistan that I get shipped in from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Tira Valley, those things are so CBD
rich, it's not funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, nowadays we know where
to look to find the populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, trying to access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, if we had had, you know,
phylos working in conjunction with pure
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics, we wouldn't have been able to
figure out how to get the numbers high and
[SPEAKER_00]: then where the lines existed from that
contain those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would have been able to get out of
all the the muddling covering genetic form
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in the in the way of the CBD
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same when we're running,
you know, high THC lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get rid of stock that's
going to slow down that ability for the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC to stack up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only have so many molecules in the
basket and, you know, maybe 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 percent total and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, and if we add Terps,
maybe 40 with Terps complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's the total that can be
present, I'm trying on a THC level to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of all my CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the conversation we're having,
we're trying to get rid of all the THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: those forms and in those in specific
genealogical locations and lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the laboratory right now is just
blowing my mind on how I'm able to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking varieties that I used to
look at and I could DNA them and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is connected to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should chase something over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask you about the the strains
that you're the seeds that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling from Pakistan because you knew
they were CBD rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talk a lot on this show about
how often genetics from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Europe find their way into these small
communities because they want to trade,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our new school hybridized
genetics locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to get their land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening is that, you know,
some of our genetics are finding their
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to, you know, Pakistan or Jamaica or
India or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they they're corrupting the local
land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the people that that,
you know, who continue to go to Pakistan
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to find more of this, these
original land races to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: are they finding that that the CBD aspect
of it is becoming corrupted yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, because you're the difference
between, you know, Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan and a lot of places is that I
mean, very little Europeans are hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out over there for the last 10,
15 years and very little Americans are
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are places where, you know,
they're really difficult to get stock in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the stock is being replaced
by opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're losing land race due to
opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's places like South America,
Central America, Africa, those places are
[SPEAKER_00]: where the, you know, the euro and the and
the North American genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and people don't understand what land
race means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And land race means non cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that the plants, the plants
seeded and grew themselves for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it contains genetic
information that says, hey, in this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is the genes that said survive during
drought, survive during a flood,
[SPEAKER_00]: handle pestilence, handle poor conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those survival genes exist and
live within the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we go into a land race
line and we do something called cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pull something out of it that we
like specifically and we monocrop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that we don't have
any more of these land race populations to
[SPEAKER_00]: look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really similar to like when you're
chopping the rainforest down, you've
[SPEAKER_00]: removed a lot of the genetic material to
work with and you can't replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us right now, it's why I'm so
is so caught up with the genetic stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with phyloses that it's allowing me to
relook at everything I'm touching to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I really looking at so that it
makes it makes it worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to sift through if you're trying to
find specific directions on your breed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people that are working CBD or
THC, this is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's interesting because to a
certain degree, the violence in those
[SPEAKER_01]: regions is kind of protecting what is left
of the CBD stock there naturally that
[SPEAKER_01]: well, yeah, a lot of the cannabis is being
pushed out by poppies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since there's not a lot of Western
folks showing up there for the time being,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, you know, it's probably like a
natural archive of CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, guarantee, because you got to remember
the people who live there that traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: just like me, I'm from Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a trafficker, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my whole my whole existence began
as a consumer, like I assume most
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistani and Afghani people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to them, you know, they're growing
and smoking what's what's what's making
[SPEAKER_00]: them feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm living in an environment like
Pakistan, and I don't mean societally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, environmentally, where Pakistan
hits like 135 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got like extremes in Pakistan
that are so unreal, it might be some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst weather on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dry and hot and cold and holy
Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the people there are still
cultivating their outdoor strains to suit
[SPEAKER_00]: the desires and needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that, you know, we don't have an
ability to go into these little villages
[SPEAKER_00]: and meet locals and say, Hey, your
family's been growing for the last 200
[SPEAKER_00]: years in this little bowl here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I access some of your gene lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we took it home, it would have been
some really fiery stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guarantee it would have been some
higher CBD populations than anywhere else
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before we get into how these strains
started finding their their way into
[SPEAKER_01]: people's hands, let's take another short
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is Kevin Jodry,
founder of Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who is paying attention to
cannabis medicine, it has become
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly apparent that full extract
cannabis oil, known to some as Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil, is the cornerstone of healing
humans with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a medical dispensary or retail
store, you know that your customers are
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have been working with patients
and seeking out quality full extract oil
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Pacific Northwest, you know the
provider Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kat Jeter and her team at Deep Green have
been making full extract cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: setting the standards for quality and
exact dosing for years in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Deep Green brand is known by patients
and cannabis media as a premium quality
[SPEAKER_01]: provider for sick children, cancer
patients, and others in need.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time when there are no national
standards for cannabis oil, ensuring a
[SPEAKER_01]: product is whole plant, quality assured,
and lab tested is often a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing your source is reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust in a quality brand is essential in
choosing a cannabis medicine that is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be used concentrated and in volume by
any patient, and especially those with
[SPEAKER_01]: weakened immune systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Green is looking for national brand
partners to expand the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: their legacy top shelf cannabis oil to
emerging medical and licensed states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partners benefit from the Deep Green brand
recognition and credibility, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing customer and marketing support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but Deep Green knows how to
employ the 280E tax rule so you can deduct
[SPEAKER_01]: it all from your taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with Deep Green can provide the
trust and authenticity too often pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: aside in favor of lifestyle products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your customers can assure themselves that
regardless of the state in which it is
[SPEAKER_01]: made, brand licensees adhere to the same
strict standards that patients everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: have come to expect from Deep Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Green licensing includes startup and
capital planning, as well as operations
[SPEAKER_01]: and manufacturing instruction as you'd
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information on how your company,
co-op, or medical dispensary can benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from partnering with Deep Green to provide
full extract cannabis oil to patients,

Green to connect with Kat Jeter and her
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shapingfire.com forward slash Deep
Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Kevin Jodry,
founder of Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the break, we were talking about
how the CBD strains were put together,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you sifted through all the genetics
with the help of the new cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were able to really focus your genetic
program and you found your cornerstones in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cannatonic and the ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Swiss Sue from Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're to a point that you have this
stuff and people are starting to extract
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did these strains find their way into
people's hands so that the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders who were doing citizen science
got so much bigger and then the strains
[SPEAKER_01]: found their way around the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get stabilized sour Sue around
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, we start getting all the clones to
really move out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took over another shop at that time and
I realized that the problem we were having
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBD being really put into the market
was that people who were commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: producers were intelligent enough to
understand the value of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people who were really medically needy
were really too poor to really afford
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something I started to notice as a
dispensary operator where I started to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that the true recipient was too
poor to receive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they weren't going to be able to
really help themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you make medicine to give to
people, it's usually too expensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain at a high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with cannabis, to me, so much of it
is to be able to self-cultivate your
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we realized was that these
varietals needed to be pushed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but they had to be pushed into a
system at an affordable rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't understand really how to
figure out what affordable was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just figured we'd do it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the last four years,
we distributed over about 110,000 CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's through the veterans groups,
any CBD collective, any person that could
[SPEAKER_00]: come to the shop could access any of the
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over the last four years,
we've been able to fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And groups from all over the United States
would send representatives who then would
[SPEAKER_00]: get an official California person who
would come in and get with the ID and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allowed the CBD genetics to move
across the country because they were free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't charge any money for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that still the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we just had to stop in January 1
because the Prop 64 came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Prop 64 says no products can be
given away for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to figure out how we can
work the taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just something that I was really,
I'm a strong believer in, that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's been a commercial cannabis
producer most of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got into med cannabis,
I got really, really struck by how poor
[SPEAKER_00]: people who were sick were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wasn't understanding of that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of insulated from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm busy working, so I don't see a lot of
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized when I got into this
position, like nine years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the need for compassion was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the CBD thing was something that
was so unbelievable for people who needed
[SPEAKER_00]: it for tumor relief, inflammatory issues,
cancer relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, let's just make it
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to kick it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did was it allowed everyone,
their brother, to get the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were a large producer,
we wouldn't give you trays of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused primarily on people who were
getting 10 to 20 clones at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed us to just absolutely
saturate the medical base with
[SPEAKER_00]: self-producers of their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we allowed a lot of these people that
were doing this to get genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Lawrence had died.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away probably three,
four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he passed away, I received a huge
collection of his CBD genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took that collection and spread
that out into the system so that these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes were all in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people, medical elderly,
they would get CBD seed packs of CBD from
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would get cuttings from me
that were connected to the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would help them with
predicative and selection process so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could start to stabilize the lines
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you started to have community
groups of elderly that were doing their
[SPEAKER_00]: own CBD juicing program, CBD medicine
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to do it in a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to tie them in with labs and
other makers so that they could all work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really cohesive fashion so that they
could afford to produce the medicine at
[SPEAKER_00]: the level they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it was the best thing I ever
did in cannabis because it drove CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout as far as I could stick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one had to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allowed everybody to get their hands
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did was it took people who
were what I call mainstreamers,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're gonna find in med cannabis is
that typically med cannabis people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were cannabis per se, they would
already be on med cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would kind of integrate quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you come from med cannabis
specifically, you're usually a non-med
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we were able to take the money
away from the true CBD end of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just absolutely shocked mainstream
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made a lot of them cry because they
were needy of help and compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they received it in such a human
way, it shocked them and it changed their
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of us as a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know because I see the ripple of it
through the communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so grateful to be able to be
part of that because it's the ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to be used intelligently by all
people and the stigma is what's screwing
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD to me was what allowed people in
the mainstream to see us who are more rec
[SPEAKER_00]: users as normal where just because I like
to be infused with cannabis doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm less of a human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that people who had medical issues
were able to get cannabis, and when they
[SPEAKER_00]: went to get it, they got it served to them
in such an elegant, gracious way that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no way they could look at us as
being malignancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was such a beautiful
synchronicity of goodwill and timing that
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what takes place with the
federal government right now, CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: living in 10 million homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being grown everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the conditions, the human
conditions that CBD offers relief from are
[SPEAKER_01]: so pervasive and they cause so many people
to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a profound human gift to be able to
give high CBD whole plant medicine to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's sick and watch their
spasticity stop, help them either cure
[SPEAKER_01]: their cancer or just help their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's profound for people who work with
patients to see the relief, but then to
[SPEAKER_01]: give them the relief for no money,
because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients, you get broke fast because it's
expensive being a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still see this every day as more and
more people get turned on to what CBD can
[SPEAKER_01]: do from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, heck, that's even without even
going into the states that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: medical now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and I both live in rec states
now, and we can start to see how people
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting to profit from it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the early days of every state,
it's just good growers putting a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of their crop to CBD and giving it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like RSO, Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Simpson was a farmer who wanted to
fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: He distilled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave it a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out he releases the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have made a lot of money off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 110,000 clones is $1,000,000.00.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money, but it's currency
that only has one value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The currency of doing a social justice,
you really can't calculate it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have no idea who's benefiting from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to be part, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of us in cannabis at a career like
me, we were all criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Christ, we ran from 5.0 every step
of the way, and now we're all pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: normal and we can function and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to take part in society in
a positive manner when you probably always
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to, like most of us did,
was an incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff right now is allowing
all of us that had to live this weird
[SPEAKER_00]: duality of existence, we can now be open
and honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD cannabis, to me more than any other
thing, is what allowed the mainstream to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once they realized that cannabis
was valid for their need, now they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to say, well, maybe it's valid for
your need, and who's to say you're wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: once we start to find validity?
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to see radical changes in how
mainstream looks at people who smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of elderly that come to me for
cannabis assistance is unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: because we try to explain to them how to
use the products, how do you titrate your
[SPEAKER_00]: doses, how do you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the elderly are in concern,
or if you're ill and you're concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: we let you come in, just apprentice at the
shop, and we'll be able to help you and
[SPEAKER_00]: show you and get you up to speed enough to
where you're gonna be able to go home and
[SPEAKER_00]: do your cultivation work yourself and get
some success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to set it up to where we put them
in groups, to where the CBD people always
[SPEAKER_00]: work in groups of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it allows you,
I came up with the whole piece based off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the legal production amount of Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did all this R&D on my own,
but I used Humboldt County's legal numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: to create an indoor model because that's
where they have the most stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people can do indoor, but not
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so legally, you're allowed this X
amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created this little mini model,
and I did all the R&D so I could
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how much came off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically the model we put
everyone into, and it allows a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be able to cultivate a couple
months of the year, and then the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the month, you don't have to cultivate,
you just benefit from the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who are older and elderly
and they start to become, weakened from
[SPEAKER_00]: their condition, they don't have to
suddenly fail from production because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to tie the groups together
and put people together, and I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: serve as the technical hub, and sometimes
I would give them money to buy the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would find extra light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just do whatever we needed to do
to facilitate, but it allowed these people
[SPEAKER_00]: to feel strong enough to self-build their
little systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And slowly, all of a sudden, you started
to see regular individuals who never used
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis suddenly have benefit from
cannabis better than they ever had from
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream pharmaceuticals, and they
became some of the most vocal proponents
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis usage of anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you convert mainstream people
into cannabis users, and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in life without any decrease in
quality of life, it is a change for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of us that are commercial
cannabis guys, or Korea users,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we needed the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, but CBD, which doesn't get
you high, allowed everyone who wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: get high an ability to say so without
having to feel like you're a drug addict
[SPEAKER_00]: and ashamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the best thing that ever happened
for cannabis as a whole was the pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: on TV of kids having seizures and then
those seizures stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally opened up a whole new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask you about the potential
darker side of it, because so far we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking about the kind-hearted
growers who had been trying to put CBD in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hands of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can imagine that there were probably
some opportunists that you came across who
[SPEAKER_01]: were grabbing the ACDC strain and renaming
it and trying to claim it as theirs or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you come across much of that while you
were in the process of spreading it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much that they were trying to grab
it as their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just more a matter of you were
seeing and what I got to see was I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: see people's intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the drug game my whole life,
so I'm no virgin to seeing shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got to see some different shady
where I got to see people who they
[SPEAKER_00]: realized the value of the CBD and that
these people were basically a captive
[SPEAKER_00]: market, that they needed the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would come to me and say,
hey listen, we want 20,000 clones so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do this big production, we're gonna do
this thing, we're gonna get all this
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny because for a lot of us
that are in cannabis, the people that came
[SPEAKER_00]: to us to do this, they kind of believed
that we were corrupt too and it was weird
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're felony-leveled cannabis
growers prior and so we have a history of
[SPEAKER_00]: being lawbreakers, but none of us that
were in cannabis wanted to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: scandalous shit and push the big CBD
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you got to see was the
separation in cannabis where all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden it was people who were not in
cannabis who came in with the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially salvage this product and push
it and it was a direct war between them
[SPEAKER_00]: and guys like us, Ringo, all the people
who were trying to get the product into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hands of the people so that they could
self-medicate, self-heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to see this abuse of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as you see with any abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of weird because it was
the first time I got to see it in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had anybody really come in and
be parasitic like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never had anything that was quite
like this where you had an ability to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that if you could get it below a
certain THC level, you could sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where the whole,
you know, ACDC, these CBD oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: well all of a sudden it opens up the
market for the entire fake Chinese hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're having all this industrial-grade
trash oil covered with pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals being given to people who are
very ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, those are the issues
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I tried so hard to get the
product into the hands of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people I know did the same
thing where we just drove it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samantha Miller and Jason from Pure
Analytics, I mean, they went on a crusade
[SPEAKER_00]: of free-speaking lectures where they
toured everywhere talking so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: would be able to understand what is this
thing, how do you use it, what do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, where do you access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this way, individuals would be able
to get themselves out of that situation to
[SPEAKER_00]: where they weren't in such a potentially
usury role.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to consider how
the street price or the retail price,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, of CBD has evolved and will
continue to evolve over the next decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you were talking about in the
first set that when you first had the high
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD stuff, you couldn't give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The retailers didn't know what to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just were looking for high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with, you know, increased
education and of course, the super popular
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanjay Gupta TV episode about it,
you know, suddenly everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the, you know, there's just
not enough prepared CBD oil to go around
[SPEAKER_01]: to all of the patients that could use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suddenly the prices then skyrocketed,
not because people were necessarily trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, screw people over,
but just because the market was pushing it
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was so little of it
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's even more so in rec states
where, you know, the first wave of
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed growers, I mean, they're going to
go for the THC stuff because that serves
[SPEAKER_01]: the most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, for example, in Washington,
you know, there's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just barely enough of the CBD in
the market even say that it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the prices are still high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a couple of years from now,
there's going to be a lot more people
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it at the commercial and license
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the price will come back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, talk about a variable
pricing of a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gosh, it's not quite to the commodity
level yet where it's as inexpensive as
[SPEAKER_01]: some THC stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you know, you know, where it's
pricey is in banned states to mothers with
[SPEAKER_00]: kids who are dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're the ones that are just
getting screwed on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, oh, my God, talk about because the
problem is that once they let the cat out
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag, the cannabis has positive
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cure every damn problem,
but it can sure do a lot for a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then people who are having problems
become curious because they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, they want to save their kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that it opens them up
because they typically don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: production quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like Rick Simpson oil to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for all in Humboldt,
it's a little different because all of us
[SPEAKER_00]: are large growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if what we do is we take portions
of our crops and we have it turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Simpson from people we know that are
Rick Simpson makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now that sixty four is here,
we'll figure out how to work with this
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the years prior, for the last,
say, so many years, we know people who do
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they'll do is they'll donate
their time and they end and we pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I donate the material, the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then produce RSO and then we can
give it to people who are who are lower
[SPEAKER_00]: income, who are going through tumor cancer
because an RSO treatments really about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, shit, sometimes up to six grand
for a two month shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so six grand is a tremendous amount of
money for people who are absolutely wiped
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what you have is the
grower community has typically carried a
[SPEAKER_00]: river of these people in and grow a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to get, hey, look,
look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's a it's a thing that's
necessary because if we don't do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the product won't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the guys that are growing weight
aren't able to give up a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, there's no subsidized medicine for
the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it opens it up to these larger CBD
type companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're paying some money, you're
paying, you know, for a CBD cartridge in
[SPEAKER_00]: form, you know, you might be paying over
100 bucks or something for a gram of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's incredibly expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also why folks who need
RSO, even in legal states, are still
[SPEAKER_01]: tending to find it in the casual or
informal unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, most of the growers
that I know who are growing specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: for patients, you know, they'll have their
price for one gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they know you have cancer and
you're going to do the 60 grams over 90
[SPEAKER_01]: days regimen, you know, they tend to give
you a price break because you're buying 60
[SPEAKER_01]: grams at once and they know you're sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's not how it goes in
the rec states because you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to give volume price breaks like that,
the way that the laws are so far.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of buying 60 grams, you're buying
60 single grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're paying full price for the
whole lot of it, which is, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hitting the person who can
afford it least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part that's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not smoking cannabis
because I have glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get lifted mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a spiritual smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully when I have, you know,
if I ever have medical problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis hopefully will help me with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, from being in my position
all these years, what I see is if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: real med, you are having some real issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start to get caught up
with parasitic type individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem with cannabis is that
cannabis is almost traditionally always
[SPEAKER_00]: been pretty kind, the people in cannabis
dealing with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've changed it from a shared
product to a commoditized product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a question of, you know,
how do you still maintain the compassion
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is not the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants cannabis, but I still like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would prefer if it remained that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mind business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about making money because I have to
feed my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is so elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to diminish it with
shoddy, poor, cheap behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, hey, I still want to talk about
what you see next for CBD development,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's take our last break here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we come back, we'll talk about
that.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is Kevin Jodry,
founder of Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has all been really inspiring so
far, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we're all
curious about is what CBD holds for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we certainly know that there are
product developers coming up with new ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to get CBD into the human system to help
bathe their endocannabinoid system with
[SPEAKER_01]: these healthy cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know you come from a breeding
background and there's just becoming more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more people interested in CBD and
probably also breeding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like you to look into your crystal
ball a little bit and let us know what you
[SPEAKER_01]: see forthcoming with CBD breeding and
where you might encourage people to look
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're looking to get involved
breeding some lines themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with CBD breeding, what you're
going to find is that as we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: become really cognizant of the impact of
the terpene profile on how we perceive the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, that you're starting to see people
weaving CBD into a lot of the higher THC
[SPEAKER_00]: strains so that we can pull those terp
profiles that we find so enjoyable and mix
[SPEAKER_00]: it in with the CBD because people are
starting to find for a lot of individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little bit too much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little too racy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little too intense and they're
starting to find that they like CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they need the terp profiles to get the
effect that they really, really want
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that these terpene
profiles are what drive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm seeing is I'm seeing some
really interesting CBD being woven in with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of OG lines being intercrossed,
a lot of these sexy OG Skittle lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: sherbet lines, cookie lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all being hit with CBD pods and
pollen to see if we can find things that
[SPEAKER_00]: have those enjoyable palette and presence
but not in such a powerful form.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of cool too is they're
starting to create delivery devices like
[SPEAKER_00]: Penform.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Humboldt brand has a really neat pen
that buzzes when you reach like two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing about using these
products is the titration, the dose
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're starting to see preloaded
pens that when you hit it, it stops
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting after X amount is put through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to really dial in your
dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you're starting to be able to
see CBD is, we can use it as a balance
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have pens at my shop that a lab here
at Alenix, they made for me so that
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that had an overdose on an edible
or an overdose on too much BHO,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I waited until I found someone who had
a good overdose and we hit them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD pens that were designed to completely
counter-effect the high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within seven minutes,
it knocked it completely out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone went from having a full panic
attack to complete stability in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not heard of that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're still, when somebody has an
over-medicated experience, we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them betacaryophylline terpenes to
help bring them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But high CBD consumed, it knocks it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm seeing is high CBD in spray form
and people that have epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at an event and a lady fell down
with a seizure and her friend went right
[SPEAKER_00]: over to her bag, pulled out a spray
bottle, sprayed it in her mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped her seizures on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really an ACDC
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing people who have these
seizures bring in with them from their own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and people who are with them know
to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the change in this woman's,
the seizure was instantly nullified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a few minutes, she got up off
the floor, we cleaned her up and she went
[SPEAKER_00]: right back about her normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you're seeing CBD being used
in some really interesting methodologies
[SPEAKER_00]: to help and change existing effects,
but it's becoming so convenient to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the breeding lines go,
you used this great analogy earlier about
[SPEAKER_01]: this molecular basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And originally you're trying to breed out
your CBD because you wanted to leave more
[SPEAKER_01]: room for more THC and more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to top out at 40%,
you want to use each percentile towards
[SPEAKER_01]: your goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think everybody can benefit
from CBD even if they're even if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking for the THC because the CBD just
makes the THC experience that more much
[SPEAKER_01]: more pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD strains have got crappy terps,
you know, they're just, they're not very
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look, you got to hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do is I hunt through the
lines and then we find a cutting of it
[SPEAKER_00]: that we say, Hey, this is something that's
palatable and it's chemo type is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's terp profile is sexy and it
grows well for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have something that people
can use and say, Hey, I felt really good
[SPEAKER_00]: when I smoked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go, Holy shit, it's a 20%
CBD, 10% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're, we're, we're, I don't tell
you what it is when I give it to you
[SPEAKER_00]: because otherwise you won't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I start to give people some of
these high CBD strains that have neat terp
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, you're seeing them gravitate to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing it, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting people to be able to really
use cannabis in the way they should have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in the way they need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's talk to a minute specifically
for the breeders who are listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are, you know, at least all over the
country listening to the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but, you know, we've got some
international listeners as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but let's talk directly to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that they are, you know,
a historically high THC grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been fascinated, but about the
story that you've been saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously they, they know about CBD,
you know, where, where's the promise,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what, what would you consider?
[SPEAKER_01]: People do, you know, like, like try to get
their hands on ACDC and then start
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing it with stuff or, or where,
where do we direct them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got a couple options,
you know, access some access, some known
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD CBD cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have cloning material in your
library, and then you will go into a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock from CBD Dom stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, I would stick with Ringo stock
that he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done some beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_00]: His, his kids are still running his
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, work with known lines and
then the problem that you have with CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have to be aware of is that when
you do your predicated work on CBD with,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I pick, I'll give you an example from
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I choose a male and the male tells me
it's, you know, it's, it's a month and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it's 4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, 0.1 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pretty much say that that male is
going to be that all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: adulthood and through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD is kind of weird where sometimes
when we identify CBDs as kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they chemically change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They morph, so to speak, through their
process and they end up not being the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio they should have been from their
predicated look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing predicated,
you use it to mark out liars, but run the
[SPEAKER_00]: damn thing through all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way you can double check and make
sure everything holds true with what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it, once you know that that
cutting holds true all the way through,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that it changes crop to
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that when I look at,
sometimes kids, I look at a kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kid's predicted to be a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might not want to breed that kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have said, okay, this one's
going to be a genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a note on him when he's 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's still see if he's smart and let's
see if he can still breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you have to be honest about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of this is trying to get the
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for a lot of breeders,
it's, they say, I want CBD because they
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the number and they go, Ooh,
it's a CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is it's not palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no value to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what you want is you want,
you know, it's an ideal thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend that did this in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just really did a beautiful job
breeding a CBD, a heavy Pakistani,
[SPEAKER_00]: a heavy Pakistani into the OG lines until
he came up with basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10, 15 CBD, you know, maybe eight or
nine THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a beautiful CBD dom strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plenty of THC with that mere seeing
dominant profile so that he thinks he's
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking OG, but he's able to really be a
lot more lucid during his day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing growers who are able to say,
Whoa, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to wipe me out so hard
for my daytime function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD to dominant makes you kind of edgy
and racy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really each individual kind of
sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and for me, what I, what I'm looking
for in CBD lines is, is the ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant produce a product in flower
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quality there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's quality and flower, it's quality
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean as far as bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to smell good, look good,
be good, because the bottom line is that
[SPEAKER_00]: product still, if, if that product is good
there, it's still as good on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end, but not vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a CBD product that could
be consumed as flower and not oil because
[SPEAKER_00]: the tremendous number of cannabis smokers
who smoke joints don't like pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore they can't smoke CBD because
CBD isn't provided to them in flower form
[SPEAKER_00]: in a form that's quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I create it myself so that I can have
it at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it for people I know, because if we
want to smoke during the day, but not get
[SPEAKER_00]: blazed, this is the right product and you
want it to be good looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be good smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, Shane goes, when someone put
the word medical on weed, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: concept was diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as someone said it's medical,
that means it can look like shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can taste like shit, it can grow like
shit, but because it's medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth of the matter is that's
marketing belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always matters and it always will
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's how you have to see it
from like a plant perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any, I'm a Nazi on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any question that
we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people, you know,
just in casual conversation will say to
[SPEAKER_01]: me, oh, you know, I don't want this CBD
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all, it all sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taste wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, we've all, we've all been
working on hybridizing these flavors of
[SPEAKER_01]: the high THC stuff for decades,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been carefully sculpting these
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got CBD, you know, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very little and we, and the
problem is that people aren't looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it correctly because it's being looked at
from a medical perspective only,
[SPEAKER_00]: not from a recreational usage point of
view, where you start to weave the CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would depend on the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your CBD THC ratio totals and profiles
would all go into your creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, you're going to get
some killer high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to be so unbelievably
enjoyable to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're not look at
everyone's going the extraction so quick
[SPEAKER_00]: because extraction allows you to take
commercial and make it into a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction cuts craft right out of the
loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and while, while you might be coming
from medical cannabis plants, we all know
[SPEAKER_01]: that there, there are certain volatile
turps that you lose any, even your best
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extractions leave something and take
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant is the way to go for the
most balanced effect and the bot we,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know this from usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is, I'm not arguing because I
like one over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that when I want to keep myself
balanced on a cannabinoid level,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be whole plant flower because
extracts just do not give you a balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: effect over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Kevin, thank you so much for being
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, you know, ever since I heard
you give just a little, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four minute taste of this story at
Terpestival, I knew that I wanted this day
[SPEAKER_01]: to come so that, you know, we could have
you give the long version of the story and
[SPEAKER_01]: we could get it recorded.
