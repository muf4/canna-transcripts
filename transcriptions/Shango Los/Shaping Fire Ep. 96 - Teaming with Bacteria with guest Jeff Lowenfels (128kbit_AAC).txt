[SPEAKER_02]: One of the key attributes I look for in
friends is an open mind, with an ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn new things and evolve,
even change opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: While some folks respect being the same as
they've always been, I'm not one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a pretty active learner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And active learning is also a healthy
trait for a cannabis cultivator to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: For as long as any of us have been alive,
we've had to learn cultivation in secret,
[SPEAKER_02]: picking up hints from print magazines,
the guidelines that guide the gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: store, random folks at parties,
and if we're lucky, maybe a mentor in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, the internet and forums came
about, and that has been great for
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading both good and bad information
about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a period now where cultivators
have the opportunity to partner more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more with institutional scientists to
compare our cultivation recipes to
[SPEAKER_02]: establish science to develop new,
modern best practices for growing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing for sure, as cultivators,
the opportunity to partner with
[SPEAKER_02]: professional soil and plant scientists
looking to help us grow our best plants
[SPEAKER_02]: ever is extraordinary and will change how
cannabis is cultivated forever.

[SPEAKER_02]: Dispatch, now for over 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also a lawyer and former radio and TV
show host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff has been on Shaping Fire before,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 21 on Teaming With Microbes and
Fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Episode 47 at Shaping Fire Live in
Portland, Oregon with additional special
[SPEAKER_02]: guest Seth Crawford on the breeding and
use of modern auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, on episode 53 to talk about
his recent book on auto-flowering cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for new home growers and cannabis
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, though, during set one,
we will review a bit of what we know about
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria generally and the importance of
bacteria in and on cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the second set, we explore the
Rhizophagy Cycle in serious detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the third set, we talk about
specific methods to put this new
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of endophytic bacteria to
work for us in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's always great to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, since we're friends outside
of the show as well, it's nice to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: your voice because there hasn't been as
much opportunity to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: see other cannabis professionals around
the country, like during this COVID
[SPEAKER_02]: craziness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's actually nice to hear a good
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this stuff will pass and
we'll be meeting again in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's always been the teaming
with trilogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, you did teaming with microbes,
and then it was teaming with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it was teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and then you switched
over and you did an auto-flower book.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now suddenly you're back with a fourth
book in what we all know is a trilogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you always know that there was
going to be a fourth book eventually,
[SPEAKER_02]: or did you just become inspired after
learning more about bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, you know, you never think about the
next book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, once you write a book,
you never think you're ever going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very difficult process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go down in that little rabbit
hole and stay down there and write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I wrote the first
book, teaming with microbes, I did it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was upset that nobody really
understood and was talking about Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine Ingham's soil food web concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book, I got excited about after
talking to Dr. James White because it adds
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole new dimension to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds a whole new dimension to the soil
food web and just creates a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different picture and raises new questions
which we'll be able to study and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with and become better growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't expecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came across the subject matter,
it flipped me out to the point where I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew I had to really investigate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I discovered that it had
some real possibilities for growers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it became a necessity to write the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I was trying to figure out
how to refer to the series now that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's four in the series, I actually
looked up, you know, if a trilogy is three
[SPEAKER_02]: books, what is four books?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got two, there are two options.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a tetralogy or a quadrilogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you or have you chosen one of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use to describe four books?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't really figured it out
yet because I also try to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: I use to sign the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I haven't really come to a
decision, but it's going to be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those two words probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we've talked before, you know,
you've described like reading the series,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of us who have been with you
since the beginning, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you put out Teaming with Microbes and it
was an easy read.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fun read and we learned a hell of
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it really made the,
you know, microbe life and the soil food
[SPEAKER_02]: web much more accessible to a lot of us in
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your second book, Teaming with
Nutrients, was also highly educated,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as you said before, it's a little bit
of a heavier lift as far as a read goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more vocabulary,
numerical science, shall we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: than the Teaming with Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Teaming with Fungi, again,
was, you know, a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biological storytelling and it was things
that we could do stuff right about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the various books have
got like different heft of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: of difficulty in reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where on that scale do you find this
new book on bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on one level, I find it,
you know, I find it very simple to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, but on the other level,
it's the most complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is because it does talk
about bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only familiar with bacteria in a
general sense, in a health sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start using bacterial
names and have to spell them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, it becomes much more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start dealing with an
organism that's so small that we really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't study it as a society, we don't
study it in school and that's a bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: that little dot, you know, you got to
learn some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to teach myself and I figured,
you know, I probably had to teach the
[SPEAKER_00]: reader as well before I could get into the
real subject matter of what bacteria do
[SPEAKER_00]: for us with regard to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's good, you know,
well put because you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I was reading your book,
and thank you for sending me in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the first half of it is a bit
of, you know, refresher of high school
[SPEAKER_02]: biology, a lot of stuff I hadn't thought
about in a long time, but it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary for the second half of the book,
which is like, you know, getting into a
[SPEAKER_02]: race car, it goes fast and it's thrilling
and it's absolutely crazy the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: that you that you learn from the book,
but you really do need to be reminded what
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, I mean, I haven't
thought about gram positive and gram
[SPEAKER_02]: negative things in a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one other thing that we should hit on
before we get into the meat of the topic,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a piece of vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you discuss the difference between
the words bacteria and bacterium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really, really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the one of the reasons why
people really can't understand bacteria in
[SPEAKER_00]: a general sense, unless they really
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterium is an individual bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria are the population of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I like to look at it,
when most people think about bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are thinking about their car in a
driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That car is the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say bacteria, you're thinking
about the the parking lot at the Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Atlanta airport,
you know, thousands and thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so those two concepts are key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we often slip into talking about
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly ever a bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things they
multiply every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many of them that even
when you're talking about an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bacterium, you're really talking
about bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I like to tell people to do and
it's one of those things that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google bacteria on the on a needle,
you'll end up with a picture of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: on the tip of a needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's just a mind blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to pay for the picture to
put it in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I'm just telling you about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable how small they are and how
many they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so really what we're talking about
when we when we were talking here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about bacteria, multiples,
even though we refer to bacterium to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe the individual and what its parts
do, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never see an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always see the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's push a little more on that
size aspect of it, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the examples that you give in the
book of how small an individual bacterium
[SPEAKER_02]: is, it's it's really remarkable where,
you know, ahead of a needle is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have thousands of them, which which really
tells me that that this is an organism
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're going to be interacting with in
in the huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're two micro point two
micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the example I give in the book is
is that if you first of all, if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at a human hair, human hair is about 18 to
180 micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but if you made a bacterium the size
of a spruce bark beetle or a bark beetle
[SPEAKER_00]: and you and the tree itself, you know,
was the normal size, that's sort of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the hair versus the little
teeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're teeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they're just they're just hard to
conceive of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what I tell people is they're so
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many of them that when
you drop that Frito or that Dorito chip on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor, don't believe in the in the in
the two second rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be talking again and again over
the course of the episode about bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: and using water and moisture as a tool in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but categorically, you know,
bacteria require moisture to create their
[SPEAKER_02]: mucilage they use to move and to grab
passing nutrition and microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this suggest that a bacteria is more
part of the water food web instead of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil food web?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I don't really think of it
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All soil particles have a microscopic
coating of moisture around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so it's a natural environment for
bacteria to live in and to move around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, remember, they don't move
very far or they don't have to move very
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very, very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the whole dynamics of
how they move about and and what they do
[SPEAKER_00]: as they move about just absolutely
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that water level in the soil,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in your compost, in your
vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, inside plants is plenty of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I consider it to be, you know,
attached to the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if bacteria require water to be mobile,
what is the mechanism they use to move
[SPEAKER_02]: around?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I imagine like something like
ores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if they're so small,
and this is something very hard for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: conceive, they're so small that they that
they can't use something like ores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're they're the dynamics of
fluid at that at that size level is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they use ores, they would just
sort of spin around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't they wouldn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've developed this wonderful
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these flagellum, these these
propellers, literally motors, and they use
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 percent of their of their
proteins to produce these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spin around these little little
motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have they rotate about a thousand
times a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast they move and and how much energy
they take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and depending on what kind of bacteria
it is, they have them on the ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have them in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have thousands of them or they
can have one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they've developed this ability to
be able to use this propeller motion to
[SPEAKER_00]: move through this fluid, this sort of
jello to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can imagine that if you were
in a swimming pool full of of solidifying
[SPEAKER_00]: jello, how difficult it would be to move
while that's that's the problem they face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they've developed these
unbelievable motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the pictures of them,
they are motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sort of pinch yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable what we can see with
microscopes these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and they rotate six thousand RPMs
rotations per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did that with your current car engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're they're pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and they develop these protons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they use these protons which
they to move these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just they're unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned all the variety of
mobility mechanisms that the different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of bacteria have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gotten an idea of how small they
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us an idea of of how numerous
the varieties are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine there's so many on the
planet that we're still finding new ones
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do we have any sense of of of their
numbers on the planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're discovering new ones all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read an article today that they
wandered into some cave in Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered a thousand different bacteria
and they've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I will say that I read studies that
indicate that in soil is kind of a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a set amount and kinds of bacteria in soil
that's pretty pretty much similar all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the the plant can pick from
that what they need with the with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but bacteria, you know, they're
they're just so plentiful and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the ability to be able to
transfer DNA as they're going about their
[SPEAKER_00]: daily lives to make subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you know, it's really easy for
them to change by by transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like you're reading my notes
because that is my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I you know, I know there's not
boys and girls in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so will you explain to us both how they
reproduce and how they transfer their DNA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, with with them
reproducing, doubling in number every 20
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, there's so much opportunity for
the passing of DNA and evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must they must evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and there's two different ways
they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what when they divide to multiply,
there's a there's a quasi nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the right term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains chromosomes, the plasmid,
and it divides itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes some some of the chromosomes
leak out of that plasma as it's as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing and is floating around out there
free and gets involved in another
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes two bacteria will back up
next to each other, put out this little
[SPEAKER_00]: plank way and transfer a couple of little
DNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, it must occur that
occasionally one bacterium eats another
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium and absorb some of that DNA into
its plasmid and becomes a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're yeah, they change all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really like a what I want to
say is that I want to say like a like a
[SPEAKER_02]: carrier, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in right in mammals, you'll get like,
you know, the seminal fluid that is
[SPEAKER_02]: holding the packages, which then have the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about a level of biology
that is that is so basic that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: they it's just the transfer of the of the
DNA itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught I caught three different three
different varieties that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, when they when they one separates
into two, and there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: accidental leakage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one being where one eats
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third one, where one pokes
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so even the fact that there are
multiple ways that it happens,
[SPEAKER_02]: tells me that there's there's there's
constantly so many variables every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new I don't know, generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, which is why they can live in so
many different kinds of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also why we have bacterial
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, after a while, you know,
they they outsmart us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so so yeah, they're just they're
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we we've talked before,
we don't study them in school because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're too damn small for people to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we study dinosaurs, which are
too, you know, too extinct, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be of any use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish we were studying bacterium and
doing more microbiology in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and actually, you know, at home
preschool, you know, with the plush toys
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, as we've talked about,
I mean, you know, little kids know their
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium names.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but they do know a dinosaur name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bacterium is still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so how do these bacteria talk to each
other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they very much appear to cooperate
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can put chemicals out into the
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those chemicals reach the right
concentration, they can cause the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: group of bacteria to act in, you know,
in particular ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's a sensing they have
that they're able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they also can obviously talk
individually to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's the quorum sensing that
people know bacteria for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an individual bacteria might be
swimming around, having a nice happy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, it's starts to
pick up this this, you know, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_00]: better word, sort of a pheromone as to all
the other bacterium that are around it,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the ones that, you know,
that were their mother and father 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden they act they act the
same way and they fly in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: direction or they move, they they attack
the same thing, whatever, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it happens to be that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all do it at once because there's
little sensing signals out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that's quite an impressive
moment when you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's probably really hard to
look at one single bacterium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're probably seeing looking at like
a small group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody but but it isn't difficult to
see one anymore was when we you and I went
[SPEAKER_00]: to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it and it probably is today in normal
high schools because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oh, my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can now see individual strains
of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so yeah, we can we can see
individual bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, later on in the show,
we'll we'll talk about about the the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that go into plants and and the
pictures that are in the book are
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God, who that that moment of
watching, you know, a bacterium and then
[SPEAKER_02]: watch it, you know, start to be surrounded
by other bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that moment where I mean,
I'm assuming that there's this moment of
[SPEAKER_02]: shift where I as the observer,
I see them just milling around and then
[SPEAKER_02]: suddenly I can tell they've started to
coordinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's almost like, you know,
not to anthropomorphize too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's almost like like a moment of them
gaining intelligence because of the quorum
[SPEAKER_02]: sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or because you know me,
I mean, in the back of teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, I sort of I sort of laid out my
philosophy that we're just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're it's the dandelion theory of life
that we're just, you know, we're Horton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the who we're the little people and
there's a bigger people and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another bigger dandelion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, these bacteria,
we're just bacteria, perhaps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we quorum sense, you know,
I'm going to vote for so and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the group gets together and
they vote for so and so it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like quorum sensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that idea that we're all bacteria,
you know, that's that's that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: barely a metaphor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's there's actually truism to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so much of our body is bacterias
and microbes and these life forms that are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually following their own, I guess,
intent or plan, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and yet, you know, I think of it as
they make up my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, my body is only like about
30% unique to me and the other 70% are all
[SPEAKER_02]: these living life forms that that my body
is somehow coordinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what gets even more trippy is that
some of the things that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always talk about the soil food web
operating like the stomach, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils, big, big stomach digesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, my God, what happens in the
stomach and what happens in rhizophagy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're going to talk about,
it's unbelievable how similar they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, these bacteria control us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a bad bacteria,
you get sick and and you've got some good
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that probably take out the bad
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's phenomenal how how they
operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter whether they're inside
you or inside a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are they are controlling lots of
things we have no idea they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as we are, you know, we're kind of
setting up this these generalizations
[SPEAKER_02]: about bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's kind of approaching the
second set from the same context.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know how they reproduce and transfer
their DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a kind of an idea how they talk
with each other, how to like they
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially eat or acquire nutrients and
create energies for themselves because
[SPEAKER_02]: they, you know, they don't have mouths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so what's their deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they do they absorb it or
photosynthesize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they could do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some photosynthetic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that go through
endosymbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they take they open up and
actually invaginate around what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and others absorb it like a plant
absorbs through through channels and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in there through their cell wall and then
into the membrane and then into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's invaginate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be totally cool word of the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have a look that we're done
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's making you you know, you open up
and you and you're like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: encompassing your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's there's lots of different ways
that they get the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because there's so much so many
different variety of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pretty much any way that you can
think about it probably happens in some
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so there's so much variety that that
we're not going to lock that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so so bacteria are so small that they
do influence the macro world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, let me let me say that
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria are really small, but they do
influence the macro world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any idea of what their numbers
must exist, like how many of them need to
[SPEAKER_02]: get together for them to influence levels
of magnitude in nature that we notice it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's probably two answers
to that on both extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowflake.
[SPEAKER_00]: One bacterium can cause a snowflake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, on the other hand, then we can
totally notice it, though, we can still
[SPEAKER_02]: try to catch it on our tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take you take, you know,
some serious diseases which spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout, you know, cause pandemics,
not not the one we're going through now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, so so they can influence as
individuals and as groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in your first section,
where I'm learning more about bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some forms of bacteria have no
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't understand how that could be,
because in you know, in my only,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, high school biology,
everything has cells walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how everything stays inside and
like holds it together in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can some bacteria not have cell walls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's these are called L forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oddly enough, the term comes from the
name of the school where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: identified some London school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used L L forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are bacteria that don't have
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our story, we'll talk about one way
that they get that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you've got when you look at the
bacteria is you have a cell wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a little space and then
you've got a membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things have to go through the cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have to go into through the
membrane to get into the the the goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soup, the cytoplasm of the of the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've you've you've got the
ability for this, the insides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria to stay connected just by that
membrane in, you know, unless they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting roughed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rupture, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so so in my picture, that they have no
cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they don't have a dividing
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not something as serious as a
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so those bacteria would probably be
more fragile, but they still have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane to like hold their lives
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they might leak a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the example you might want to
think about is somebody mails you a box
[SPEAKER_00]: with a blown up balloon in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open it up, you take the balloon out,
the cell wall, was the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got that balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're not careful, it's going to
pop in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't have popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to tell you, Jeff, it's so and so
encouraging to have you back on as a
[SPEAKER_02]: guest, because, you know, this is that
there's we have a lot of information to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are such a snappy and excited and
get the words out and get to your point
[SPEAKER_02]: guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is the only way we were going
to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like we're moving through at such a
pleasant pace that like I can almost feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like information falling out of people's
ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we're actually going to be able to
get through everything in like a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a realistic time instead of like
a four or five hour show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to be around your enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've hit a lot about like generalized
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to start grounding some of this
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and we're going to start by talking a
little bit about bacteria and seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to the second set, we're going
to go in depth about the rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be our biggest set
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but I want to ground our conversation
in cannabis, since that's the nature of
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis plants have a relationship
with bacteria at every step of the life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I was really surprised to learn
that there's there's even bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed that, you know, is is is put into the
seed as it's growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's it's sitting there and wait
as it's waiting in our refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it's given the right
conditions, it is it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: told, all right, time to do your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you walk us through the
relationship between bacteria and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good time to introduce the
concept of endo fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo fights are microorganisms that live
inside a plant for at least part of their
[SPEAKER_00]: life and and sometimes contribute to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they harden the plant,
but they live part of their life inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are all manner of bacteria,
as we'll talk later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get into a plant and they can get
into a plant through little cracks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root and they can get into the plant
airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get blown onto the onto the plant and
maybe get blown onto a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is when a flower is
formed and the seeds are being formed,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you sort of sort of imagine it,
it's like an open the palm of your hand is
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower and you've got bacteria in the
palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hand closes up and those bacteria end
up inside the seed, your fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those bacteria are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are endophytic bacteria and all
seeds have bacteria in them, endo fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually, I don't know, maybe a hundred
million seeds, a hundred million bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in a seed that might be a high end,
many different kinds, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of seed it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are in the in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the seed germinates, they are
released or they come out of their
[SPEAKER_00]: dormancy and they either go into the plant
or they go most of them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these become your rhizobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add to the bacteria that are already
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are specific bacteria carried by
that seed and then deposited in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: for what purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the seed of the plant that
grows from that seed uses those bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and those bacteria to to do something
beneficial for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the seed is bringing its own
bagged lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out with cannabis that it's
bringing specific kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's just for a second, get away
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the one of the studies done that I
read was of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, corn has changed over the 400
years that you know, in the new world,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've we've been breeding it, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out that the original corn,
if you plant it today, it has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria in it that it had back 400 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it turns out that cannabis carry
their own specific desired bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and when we're dealing with seeds,
we want to be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the one thing you do not
want to do with your cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore is sterilize them, which many
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're fully capable of
completely sterilizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many people use hydro peroxide,
et cetera, to sterilize the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want every single bacteria that seed
has living and doing something in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's become incredibly common for
people to use a 70 30 mix of water and 80
[SPEAKER_02]: H2O2 with the idea that it is adding more,
you know, oxygen to the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you suggesting that the the H2O2 in
that blend is wiping bacteria from the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we got to do a lot more
research, but but it certainly makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to me that it is and that when the seed
germinates, so there's still some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: H2O2 that kills some of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or impacts the bacteria one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think we got to be very,
very careful about about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the same token, a lot of people start
their seeds in towels, paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you put the seed in,
you wet the paper towel, you fold it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the seed grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take it carefully with a
tweezer and you put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it make sense that that paper
towel contains a lot of bacteria that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bury the paper towel, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes practical advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practical advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many people, you know, if you leave
your if you leave your seed in the paper
[SPEAKER_02]: towel an extra day, a lot of the time,
the your most important new root hairs
[SPEAKER_02]: will have bonded with the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I've been in this heck I
was in that situation this spring where
[SPEAKER_02]: where I pull I pulled it, you know,
it had attached and I gave it a little tug
[SPEAKER_02]: and I separated, you know, what's going to
become the taproot from the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I it didn't feel good when
I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, ooh, I ripped root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now now after reading your book,
I understand profoundly how important all
[SPEAKER_02]: those early root hairs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to be far more careful now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm more likely just to, you know,
cut that area of the paper towel out and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant it with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seed carries these wonderful
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've discovered with cannabis in
particular, is that the bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil around a cannabis plant is generally
one cannabis plant and another cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is the plant and we're going
to talk about this, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next segment, Rizofazhi,
the plant takes up some of these bacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: and depending on the the the type of
cannabis you're growing, it takes up
[SPEAKER_00]: specific endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your Durbin poison takes up one set of
bacterium endophytes and your,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your Lemon OG takes up another
kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've always talked in cannabis about
Tawar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe we're getting into a slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not called Tawar anymore,
but the bacterium impacts the cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, you know, we are now just getting
our eyes opened on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no question that that your
cannabis is influenced by the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes that it has inside it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your book, you also lay out that
different seeds, even of the same variety
[SPEAKER_02]: and from the same seed making experience,
will have different bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_02]: different seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even if you are, you know,
intending that your seeds be you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: identical, I'll use that term loosely,
that even if you had the genetics all
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the same between two seeds and
they were actually identical, the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that they are encapsulating different
blends of bacteria means that that
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria is going to influence how the
plant grows in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is incorrect usage of the
vocabulary, but it reminds me a lot of how
[SPEAKER_02]: the scene thinks of phenos, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, you know, you got the same seed,
but you got different phenos of that seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it seems to me that that is an
interesting thing for cannabis cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're trying to judge the quality of
seeds, sometimes the seed can be produced
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it being appropriately made is
that different seeds in the same run are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going to have different bacteria
and therefore are going to start the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: off on a different path, on a different
footing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't help but have that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the same token, you know,
your strain should contain the same
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes, you know, time and time and
time again, which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that when you use,
when you again, we're sort of overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use nitrogen fertilizers,
you reduce the number of bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere that go into the plant that
influence the plant's terpene content and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you increase the amount of
bacteria that you put in the plant versus
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fertilizer, you end up with
higher terpenes, flavonoids, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so all of this bacteria talk validates,
validates, validates the organic soil food
[SPEAKER_00]: web system of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I guess we can go one
step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also validates not changing your soil
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis in the soil,
it's putting it's you know, it's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates out that are concentrating and
the right kinds of bacteria, no sense
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing that stuff out, plant in it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take advantage of what's
already happened in it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dear listener, if you're listening and
you're like, oh my gosh, Shango,
[SPEAKER_02]: ask more follow up questions on this,
we will get to that in the third set,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically how the bacteria can be
leveraged in your, in your cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, reading your description of
seed germination, the root cap that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that protects the radical, the mucilage
produced by the seed to lubricate the area
[SPEAKER_02]: of soil around the seed and how that
mucilage is used to bind microbes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: root while attracting phosphorus,
zinc, iron, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me realize that as cultivators,
we should really be careful and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and resist moving the seed once we've
placed it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yes, they're hardy and like
seeds pop, you know, and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and survive in crazy situations,
but there's so much subtle biology going
[SPEAKER_02]: on as soon as the, as soon as you're
triggering the germination that I can now
[SPEAKER_02]: see how important it is to not disturb the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that like, with this
understanding, I'm going to increase my
[SPEAKER_02]: germination rates because I have,
I have a tendency to, to like move seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and move the soil around it to like,
you know, you know, help it get more sun
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure or, or like, Oh, I watered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, it got recovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think now I understand that
it's important to just like, don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: touching the seed after you've started the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, let the plant,
I've always said the plant's in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what I learned from Dr.
Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's no reason why,
why a cannabis plant shouldn't be in
[SPEAKER_00]: control as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's go ahead and take our
first commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are probably mostly here for the
rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to leave most of the
time for that next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take our short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is that
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynamico endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynamico is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dynamico is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love using Dynamico to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamico.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before the break, we were talking more
generally about bacteria as an organism,
[SPEAKER_02]: as something that we interact with every
day in our lives but almost never think
[SPEAKER_02]: about, unless we get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started bringing that home to
the cannabis plant itself, kind of like at
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning of this cycle that we're
gonna be talking about this, this entire
[SPEAKER_02]: set, the rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see this cycle as starting with the
seed, as far as the plant's living cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with the seed because when we
germinate the seed, it brings along with
[SPEAKER_02]: it the essential bacteria that it's going
to need to grow, which is totally cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing in and of itself, but also really
useful to know as a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of want to back into this topic,
Jeff, because usually in an interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd ask successive small questions to
paint a bigger picture, slowly making the
[SPEAKER_02]: picture bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're gonna discuss rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think that before we talk
about the details of the roots and the
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake and all this stuff in specific,
we really should grok what the rhizophagy
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle is itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: In total, before we go into the details.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to do something for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to read a paragraph from your
book, just a couple of sentences,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll hand the mic to you to
meticulously walk us through it in more
[SPEAKER_02]: detail, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this, like whatever it is,
four sentences in your book, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: just nailed it so well for me after I read
all the details that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is, friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the new model of the soil food web,
plants still farm the soil, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain flocks of bacteria too.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are rounded up and corralled just
inside the root meristem cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, the bacterial walls are shorn off
and absorbed by the plant as nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: In response, the bacteria produce nitric
oxide to protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a further boon, supplying the
plant with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the plant causes the bacteria to
multiply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, the plant grows a root hair and
puts the flock of bacteria back out to
[SPEAKER_02]: pasture to get ready for the next season's
shearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this example that you give of bacteria
being like sheep really simplifies it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the point that I understand that the
bacteria are going to enter the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: through the root and then be put back out
to pasture through the roots as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is wonderfully oversimplified,
but I think that having that out in
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's ears first will help them
listen and make more sense about where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're about to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am sure that you've got a way to
explain this as like a beautiful package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I'm going to hand you
the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is going to be a pretty long
answer to the question, but why don't you
[SPEAKER_02]: just walk us through the rhizophagy cycle
in its main framework?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you kind of get to the end
of it, we'll move on to the more specific
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start with our model of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant takes its photosynthetic energy
and it uses quite a bit of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% or so, to produce exonates that drip
out into the soil that attract bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria and fungi, as you know,
attract protozoa nematodes who eat the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and fungi, poop out the excess
and all of that excess is in plant usable
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it then diffuses into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that the diffusion model of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wonderful research and work
that's done by Dr. Elaine Ingham and
[SPEAKER_00]: others that's given us the concept of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, along comes Dr. James White and this
terrific woman in Australia who made the
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery of rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered that some of these
bacteria that are congregating right there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rhizosphere, they're living in
there right at the root tip there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, as you say, in that little sloughed
off area where the sloughed off cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the root tip as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, some of them smell
this butyric acid buttery smell and they
[SPEAKER_00]: back up against the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the root wall right there in the
meristem of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: These brand new cells that are being
formed, they have very thin cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't differentiated in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a colony of bacteria sitting
right there against the cell wall of these
[SPEAKER_00]: root cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them produce ethylene,
not some of them, they all produce
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, which they make using one of the
exudates arginine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant produces this arginine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows these bacteria to produce
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ethylene enables them to push
through that thin cell wall in the
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem and enter into the space between
the cell wall, the plant cell wall in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root, and the actual membrane that we talk
about that has the little channels that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients go through, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little space between that
membrane and the cell wall called a
[SPEAKER_00]: paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in go these bacterium and they become
bacteria inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they go in, they have this
ethylene, which causes the wall to open
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethylene triggers the plant to try to
defend itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant does that by spraying
something called NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't give you the scientific word for
it, but it sprays superoxide, oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: superoxide onto the bacteria as they
enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that superoxide strips off the cell
wall of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is absorbed by the plant as
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it strips them off and the bacteria
goes, wait a second, I got to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: myself a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it produces nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both the nitric acid and the ethylene
produced create chemical reactions that do
[SPEAKER_00]: two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it reduces the power of the
superoxide, turns it into hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide, so it's been antioxidated,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, it causes the plant to provide a
little bit more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon to the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this bacteria that's literally
trapped inside that little paraplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting carbon from the plant,
but it's producing ethylene and nitric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that nitric acid turns to nitrate and
it is also absorbed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has now gotten the cell wall
and nitrate out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bacteria that's in this
paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now inside this space, there's a current.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a circular current inside the
cytoplasm, inside the membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: and inside this paraplasmic space,
you also have a circular current.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bacterium, now bacteria,
without cell walls are moved in a circle
[SPEAKER_00]: in this paraplasmic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they move, the agitation and the
fact that they've been in there for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 20 minutes causes them to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their L-forms, they don't have cell
walls, and they reproduce and they form
[SPEAKER_00]: quads and sekeplets of bacterium,
wall-less bacterium, that are circulated
[SPEAKER_00]: around the cell and they are producing
ethylene the whole time they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ethylene is causing the plant,
again, to provide a little teeny bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, but it also causes the plant cell
to grow, to elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a couple of days, literally,
these things are feeding the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing that nitrogen, and they're
moving around and they're multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They congregate, their numbers get so
large that they begin to congregate up
[SPEAKER_00]: against the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get caught in a little rough spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they produce, ethylene in that
group, that ethylene causes a tube to form
[SPEAKER_00]: off of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I know that tube to be a root
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs aren't separate cells that
attach to the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a tube that forms from the cell
that is in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got this tube that forms and the
bacterium, now bacteria, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing ethylene move into that new tube
and more and more accumulate, more
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that cycling that goes around and
all of a sudden, a little tidal wave of
[SPEAKER_00]: paraplasmic stuff gel gets pushed into
that little tube, that little root forming
[SPEAKER_00]: root hair, and it pushes the bacterium out
of the tip of that root hair into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: where they, coincidentally, grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their cell wall, and then several days
later, repeat the trip through a new
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that little explosion through that
root hair doesn't occur just once.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be three, four, five different
explosions as that root hair grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you and I have been taught that root
hairs are there for absorbing nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They increase the surface area,
what, 30% or so of the root, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really there to be ejectile structures to
put these naked bacterium, L-forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the soil so that they can pick
up more arginine, pick up more other
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates, put their cell walls back in and
go back in again and feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trapped in there providing
nutrients, getting nutrients, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're back in the soil fixing themselves
up and they go back in again where their
[SPEAKER_00]: wool is sheared, and then they're put back
out into the pasture so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: regrow their wool and come back in again
and be sheared again.
Whoa!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mind-blowing, and it makes you
wonder, are the bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, let's call them, are they
there because of Dr. Elaine's concept,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, of course, the truth,
or are they there because of Dr. White's
[SPEAKER_00]: concept?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they there first for the rhizophage
or were they there first for the diffusion
[SPEAKER_00]: model?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like a chicken and egg thing,
but it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same bacteria.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be redundant systems because
nature does that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it makes sense that the bacteria
would want to be inside the root because
[SPEAKER_00]: one once they're inside their root,
they have less competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being fed some carbon by the plant
internally and nobody else is eating that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's reasons why, and they're
multiplying like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is life here for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to multiply and propagate,
and that's what they're doing inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the philosophical question about which
came first is a fascinating one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens in there is just
absolutely unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photographs, folks, that are in
the book that show these individual
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and then show them as protoplasts
or L-forms, and then show them as quads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I should say, because it's not
necessarily in the book and I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to get into it right now,
but from a cannabis growing perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: the question I wrote in the book at the
time was, are trichomes simply root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: that are formed on the leaf in the
phyllosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of research has been done in the
two years since the book was written and
[SPEAKER_00]: went through the publishing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it now appears that there's sort of a
similar thing happening with these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause, in a sense, part of the
formation because they have ethylene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it appears that what's happening is
there are bacteria inside these trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are being bombarded by superoxide and
then are going through the antioxidant
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that they went through in
rhizophagy and are nullifying the super
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidant by producing nitrogen inside the
trichome, but also producing all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, flavonoids, cannabinoids,
et cetera, so that there is a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between the rhizophagy and
what is being called endosymbiosis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phyllosphere and inside the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely something going on
here with these bacteria that we were not
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of that we could guess at that Dr.
James White and some of his students are
[SPEAKER_00]: now coming closer to getting the answers
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I dare suspect that once cannabis is
fully legalized so that we can study it in
[SPEAKER_00]: a truly scientific method, we're going to
find out an awful lot about how these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria influences the trichomes and I'm
going to have to do a revised edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is amazing that we humans are so
cocky thinking we know so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we didn't even know that the
rhizophagy cycle even existed until 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like there's so much more research we
have to do about our planet and then
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully we won't kill it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was actually it was 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent a copy of the book to the woman in
Australia who made the discovery and she
[SPEAKER_00]: since sort of moved on apparently because
of funding etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she was she was stunned and thrilled
that somebody's really glommed onto this
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you recall her name until we can name
her and give her the respect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I can't pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to open the book up and give
it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's I just cannot pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes me so angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to find it's going to take me a
minute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go ahead and ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that is a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's it's hard to like walk
that line, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give respect to the scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also if their names are in languages
we're unfamiliar with, we also don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the disrespect of like butchering
the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry I put you in that position.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get where you were coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it gave me an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To once again point out this is not me,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make these discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Laming, you know, and Dr. James White,
they are the gurus, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was parrot what they've what
they've taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, it's I'm glad you did that
right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so so thank you for going through the
entire cycle so that as we go through
[SPEAKER_02]: these next few questions, you know,
people already have the big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're now we're just going to kind
of poke at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, one of my favorite parts of
this cycle are exudates, something that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have found fascinating ever since I
started getting involved with learning
[SPEAKER_02]: about the the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, generally, cannabis
cultivators understand that the exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: are selective nutrition that the plant
uses to feed the microbes and other allies
[SPEAKER_02]: that come out of the roots and the hairs
into the rhizosphere during the dark
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the light cycle, the plant
photosynthesizes and the rhizosphere feeds
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then during the dark cycle,
the plant like rewards the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: with exudates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But few folks, including me, have a real
understanding what these exudates
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically contain and how the
selectiveness part of the plant functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already said that that the that the
that the the plant uses the exudates to
[SPEAKER_02]: attract particular members of the
rhizosphere, including bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so will you kind of like break that
out for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this this is an incredible
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the plant uses that
photosynthetic energy to make everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always a surprise that people
tend to realize that they would waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, by by exudating these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so they can they can adjust that
exudate to attract what they need if they
[SPEAKER_00]: need more bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing if they need more protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this particular instance,
there's one part of the exudate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called disarginine that we talked
about that that really is so important to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plant wasn't producing it,
the cycle would occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it just points out how how important
individual exudates can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that some of these exudates
attract fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them attract yeast, which is a
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them act as cidophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they go out and they lock up
various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you know, there are
things that you don't want inside a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant has the capability of
putting out an exudate that can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, can glom around those particular
metals, for example, and prevent them from
[SPEAKER_00]: going inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacteria have the capability of doing
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sort of trading around with
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these exudates are incredibly important
and they have everything in the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with not only the attraction of these
microbes, but the beginning of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you attract these microbes,
they create the soil structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria with its slime, the the fungi
by time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tying tying together individual particles
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so so it's just an unbelievably
crucial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually date, as we've talked
before, our sweat is actually date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attracts bacteria and fungi to our
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if dial soap work the way that it's
supposed to work, we'd be dead in 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: because that stuff acts as a protective to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's key stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to focus in on one aspect of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you mentioned during the cycle,
you made this very interesting comparison
[SPEAKER_02]: between the traditional soil food web,
Elaine Ingham diffusion idea where our
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is growing and it absorbs nitrogen
through the roots to feed itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other example on this
bacteria focused rhizophagy cycle where
[SPEAKER_02]: the cell is brought into the plant via the
hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is then stripped of its cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, not not not via the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in through the meristem in the
root tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they find they find their way in
their stripped of their cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they are they start to produce
nitrates as a defense because they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: like my cell walls gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's produce this defending nitrate,
which nitric nitric acid nitric acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which which then turns into nitrate as a
result of some of the superoxide that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is spraying on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so here here's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is these are both different
ways that the plant gets nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you write?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that one is preferable to
that another?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we find that that both are important
because they're going to be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: different things in the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps it's just nature's redundancy
to make sure things stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think both are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's going to be a lot
more research to determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, there have been studies that
show about 30, maybe 40 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in a plant can come from
rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so obviously, that's a pretty
significant, significant number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but something else happens when that
NAPDH sprays this superoxide onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, it has to make sure that it's
not killing its own cell wall at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is the plant cell
becomes a little bit more resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better able to handle stress
as a result of that that superoxide ROS
[SPEAKER_00]: being sprayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it strengthens the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant is better able to handle
various stresses as a result of having
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even talked about the fact that
that a lot of these bacteria, these
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic bacteria that enter the root
and then move, move into the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these phyto hormones like
gibberellic acid, you know, that that that
[SPEAKER_00]: cause ethylene that causes the plant to
have different reactions to different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they help the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just incredible what these bacteria
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts and starts with stimulating
the cell of the plant to be more resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably a good place to plug the
book again, because by listening to this
[SPEAKER_02]: interview today, you are not replacing the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are there are four chapters
that I don't even pull questions from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you are if you are
hearing our conversation today and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting fired up by some of the new ideas
that you're having, for goodness sakes,
[SPEAKER_02]: go get the book because because,
you know, as as as much as I try to
[SPEAKER_02]: capture everything in this interview,
we're never going to do in an hour and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half what's in this entire book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about let's see,
where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, you know, one of the insights that
I found especially stirring was your
[SPEAKER_02]: statement that through using methods
through, you know, cultivators using
[SPEAKER_02]: methods like natural farming and Korean
natural farming techniques specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: that that we can use valuable
photosynthetic energy to biosynthesize
[SPEAKER_02]: exudates feeding the plant as much as I am
helping the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to attract bacteria and fungi to
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I skipped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skipped a line in my reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the point I'm trying to make is that
you're suggesting that that the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming and can F that we do is really
less about feeding the plant directly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really about helping the plant
bait the hook to lure and attract the food
[SPEAKER_02]: its needs, which brings us back to the
idea again that I'm not actually the one
[SPEAKER_02]: who's feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the one that's feeding the soil and
and my partner in this is the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: and through can F and natural farming,
we're actually helping the plant bait the
[SPEAKER_02]: attractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actance, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're filling up the refrigerator,
you know, and the plant doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and I think I try to make the
point in the book that we can call it can
[SPEAKER_00]: F.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can call it regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can call it whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's making sure that the soil
food web can operate to its fullest extent
[SPEAKER_00]: with the maximum amount of efficiency so
that everybody's happy, including you,
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual that's taking care of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's regenerative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It closes all the cycles and we are fully
interacting with our crops and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these these root hairs, these tubes at
the end of the roots, where we are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of flushing the the
bacteria back out for for it to regenerate
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and then to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can share it and use it to
produce nitrates again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that cycle is clearly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and as a cultivator, I want to know
what I can do to encourage root hair
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously you want to make sure that
you're not disturbing any of the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in your system, because that's what's
causing the roots hairs to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to ultimately add in
the right kinds of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know, for example, with cannabis,
which ones they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have some ideas, but are you
and I able to identify them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to figure out a system to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's all coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a time, you know, five years from
now or 10 years from now where we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to to to take a soil sample and
be able to analyze it with our cell phone
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll tell us what's in it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can you can determine what kind of
bacteria DNA you've got by sending in
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and having an expensive system
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but we're going to end up with a,
you know, like a twenty three and me
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you know, where we can find out
exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so exciting that we're getting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know there's a need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll certainly there will be a
development that gets the databases are
[SPEAKER_00]: already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got databases of all the known
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ought to be able to hook up what
we've what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's common.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but there are certain certain things
that we do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, we know that the
bacterial mix in vermicompost is different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the bacterial mix in thermal compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may turn out that using thermal
compost is better than using vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has the right mix of bacteria
in it to be able to feed the kind of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we haven't talked about
is that these plants are are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would a plant allow a bacteria to get
into its root cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it, you know, it does so if it's the
right bacteria and it knows it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to harm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so it's the plants are pretty
selective about which bacteria they're let
[SPEAKER_00]: in and which ones they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that the bacteria turns
out that some bacteria go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular kind of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean cannabis, but a particular
kind of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grass thrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same bacteria bacteria goes into a
different kind of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that grass dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this the evolution has determined
which bacteria can go into which plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to nail that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all coming coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the time that this book has been
going through the publishing process,
[SPEAKER_00]: as noted, our whole concept of what goes
on inside trichomes has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. James White and his students have
discovered some of these bacteria inside
[SPEAKER_00]: cells inside nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the nuclear poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they providing something for the
nuclear poor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they taking sugar from the new?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of neat stuff that's going
to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get better and better and
better at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to take a side quest with you at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already recommended at the top of
the show that people check out teaming
[SPEAKER_02]: with fungi, one of your earlier books,
if they have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, you know, it's a cannabis
cultivation classic, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually enjoyed by gardeners of every
kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I recommend people read that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like you to kind of like tie
us to that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like you to make the linkage
between the rhizophagy cycle and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium network, because mostly we've
really been talking about like just the
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but I know that there are handoffs
back and forth between the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: the mycelium network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that's fleshed out also in team
with fungi, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to I'd like to have you kind
of tie that in at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, none of these microbes operate
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil food web is a web, not a soil
food microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there everything is operating
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we what we've discovered is that
the first of all, the the mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi go into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't they don't invade the cell
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they they they're in between the cell
and then an invagination occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're in between the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're and they're providing
nutrients to the plant and return from for
[SPEAKER_00]: those exudates in sort of a similar way
that's happening to the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the bacteria isn't connected to
the soil anymore, it's providing nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that that may have come from the soil,
but then contained inside their their
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they operate in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, along the mycorrhizal
mycelium, you will find plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting bacteria that sometimes act as,
you know, as rhizophagy bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes they just they just help
out, you know, getting phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and giving it to the to the
fungi so that the fungi can give it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and they work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the same token, there are some fungi
that are that are not healthy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these bacteria can jump out of
the root and can kill the fungi and jump
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the root again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's this intricate relationship
that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant growth promoting bacteria,
which are in some products that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: already buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to, you know, unfortunately,
the damn mammoth, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those kinds of products,
they operate using the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they operate together and they work
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we've talked before about
how overfeeding a plant can make your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants roots and mycelium network lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from thinking about this bacterial
cycle, this rhizophagy cycle, and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the elegant work that is being done and
how very specific that the nutrients are
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant is farming and gathering
for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm convinced even more of of not
overfeeding our pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're just making all of these
kind of like, loosey goosey nutrients that
[SPEAKER_02]: we tend to add that are not as specific as
the plant is specific, that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: having all of all of this nutrition
floating around is is is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a likelihood that I'm either going
to interrupt or screw up the rhizophagy
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that I'm going to add enough food that
suddenly the mycelium network is not
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching out to to the distant parts of
the of the container or of the soil in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to get specific micronutrients or or
that I can, you know, I might even injure
[SPEAKER_02]: the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that we need to be
exceptionally careful to only feed the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants as much food as they're going to
need or or say amend as much as we need
[SPEAKER_02]: and and return our focus again and again
to soil health versus dumping nutrition
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no question that there's
studies, lots of them that show that the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical nitrogen when it's applied as a
fertilizer reduces, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizophagy symbiosis, you know,
nitrogen fixation, because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have to waste the action dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason I give anyway,
a little theological thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the plant doesn't have to
waste its photosynthetic energy doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff if it's getting it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very clear with cannabis studies
that plants that are given artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical nitrogen, they don't they don't
do the internal stuff the way the way a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end, and again, since we know
since we since we know the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the turpinoid flavonoids,
you know, these secondary metabolites and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that are in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, if you're growing
cannabis, you want those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why you want those trichomes to
have the maximum amount of production in
[SPEAKER_00]: in them as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, there there is a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we don't call it rhizophagy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we call it endosymbiosis or
symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, endosymbiosis that that involves the
trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the predictions that were in the
book have actually come true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're approaching 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're almost ready to take a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I've already said there's
no way that we're going to cover
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in the cycle today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that you are particularly
excited to talk about particular aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to kind of give you this open
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since in set three, we're going to be
talking about application of what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned in set one and two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there are there particular parts of
the cycle that I have not focused on with
[SPEAKER_02]: my question for you, that you're all like,
I really want to talk about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: because now would be the time for you to
say, I really want to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I think the the endophytes
that go into the plant not that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the rhizophagy cycle,
you know, are very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these these are also taken up from the
soil food web conglomeration of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get into the plant through little
cracks that form as branches of roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a little cracks where where
these guys can get in and they sneak in
[SPEAKER_00]: through wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I suppose some of them I
don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they come from the
rhizophagy cycle itself, but they they get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them get into the stomata and they
and they and they can travel around
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant and they impart all
of these terrific, terrific things to them
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can stimulate growth because they
they can produce auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce ethylene and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce jubarillans and jasmonic
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, all of the things that that
that that cause plants to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: to form their flowers, to drop their
flowers for their fruits to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all bacterially produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, we've we've learned an
awful lot about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and now we were beginning to figure
out how to be able to supply either the
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto hormones that they produce,
for example, with regard to gibberellins,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can now produce gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray your plant with gibberellic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need the bacteria that create
the gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we're learning all of these
things and we're beginning to apply them
[SPEAKER_00]: to to different plants, including
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and so these endophytes are
incredibly important in terms of enabling
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to operate as a plant,
produce flowers, drop flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, to increase their
their strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress tolerances to outcompete plants
that don't have them to to change the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperatures which you're able to
operate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a picture, I think, in the book of a
of an area in Houston, Texas, lawns and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the ones are covered with snow except
for one of them, because those grass
[SPEAKER_00]: plants must have an endophyte in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This changed the freezing point of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's some really
phenomenal stuff that goes on and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're learning so much about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no question in my mind of all
the books that I've ever written.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that's going to need a
revised edition at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these endophytes that you're talking
about, it sounds like they since they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not part of the the rise of haji cycle,
they're really just making a one way trip,
[SPEAKER_02]: they join the plant and then and then they
stay in the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're never they're never being re
released back into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of them are they go into the
sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're in the flower and
the next thing they know, they go back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that the bacteria are such
opportunists and they they they get into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant where doors are left open and
cracks in the root and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: wounds and all these different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting because on one
hand, you're talking about these like
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial endophytes, which we want in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is also the same place that like
pathogenic bacteria would get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, because I want to avoid the
the negative bacterias, it's got me
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking in whole new ways about,
for example, staking plants near the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, there are certainly
cages on the outside area, which which
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, best for supporting a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people are, you know,
put the stake in alongside the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: then in some way bind the plant to the
stake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that means that the stake is going
into the root zone and probably ripping
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of root and root hairs along the
way and actually causing trauma to the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone that is pretty much inviting
bacteria of all forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to me like we are rolling the
dice when we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of those stakes like,
you know, those tomato stakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they got a little green stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that there to keep?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill bacteria, you know, fungus and keep
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yeah, I mean, I think you got to be
very, very careful and an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think you got to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may very well be that you if you dip
that that stake into compost, let it sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absorbs the right kind of bacteria that
are in the compost that might help your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we've got a lot of research to do
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might just do that just as a as
a preventative at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my guest today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options and who to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend HEMBRA genetics collection to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's HEMBRA, spelled A.
[SPEAKER_02]: H-E-M-B-R-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA is not just another seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA is a woman operated boutique
cannabis genetics provider that only sells
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughtfully curated seeds from the top
names in cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: With over 50 breeders and over 500 strains
to choose from, you will certainly find
[SPEAKER_02]: something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_02]: HEMBRA genetics has something for everyone
with over 350 feminized strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 regular varieties and over 100 auto
flowers to choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names you know you can trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Humboldt Seed Company, Night Owl,
Canorado, In-House Genetics, FastBuds and
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both know that there are other seed
banks who will take your money but have no
[SPEAKER_02]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invited HEMBRA to advertise on Shaping
Fire after hearing so many good stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about them from my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have A plus customer service with
lightning fast response times.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, Helene and Caitlin will get
your order out the same day you place it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll usually receive your seeds in
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most seed banks are simply not this
organized or interested in getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to you this fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But HEMBRA cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You even get free seeds with every order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helene and Caitlin get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been in the cannabis growing
scene for over a decade.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's HEMBRAgenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: For decades, Americans have enjoyed
cannabis flowers and joints and bongs and
[SPEAKER_02]: bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with the normalization of cannabis
use increasing across the country,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the opportunity to enjoy smoking
cannabis luxuries that simply were not
[SPEAKER_02]: attainable before.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast, hand rolls, blunts,
cannons, rosin infused donuts and canigars
[SPEAKER_02]: available in the state of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast focuses on flavor over
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of growing their own flower,
North Coast goes out into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: community and creates relationships with
the best growers working with the best new
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis varieties available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely heavy THC is a factor, but North
Coast focuses on aroma, complex terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles and taste that continues
throughout the entire smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The North Coast team curates flowers like
others curate art.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seek out the best talent,
build relationships, helps them take their
[SPEAKER_02]: product to the highest levels and then
buys their well cured flowers in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: hand roll them just for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like their hand blown glass tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And North Coast has branched out beyond
canigars into rosin solventless THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds and exceptional hash rosin carts
for on the go cannabis connoisseurs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: North Coast provides you with attainable
luxury, offering you an ultra premium
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking experience at a price that seems
reasonable and repeatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: To find out more about North Coast line of
cannabis products, visit their Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: at northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's northcoast.rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when in Michigan, ask for North Coast
at your favorite shop, North Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of good people launching
new businesses in cannabis, psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_02]: other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very strange time for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the same moment that psilocybin
mushrooms are illegal at the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: level, they are becoming increasingly
legal in states across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: These businesses leading the way into the
future of plant medicines require
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized legal representation by
attorneys who have depth not only in
[SPEAKER_02]: litigation, mergers and acquisitions,
but also in psychedelic and other plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group has been empowering
cannabis businesses since 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the market has diversified into
psilocybin and other plant medicines,
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light has been right there evolving
with their diverse clients to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: legal expertise with a high level of legal
acumen, creative strategy and precision
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes with an intimate and specific
understanding of both business law and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a business owner trying to
navigate the law, and you have layered
[SPEAKER_02]: local and national drug laws on your own,
you are at risk of fumbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: These confusing and quickly changing laws
complicate everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group is ready to help you
when hit with a lawsuit, or because you
[SPEAKER_02]: were shafted by a vendor or business
partner, or simply because you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay legal and could use some preventative
guidance before cultivating a controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: substance as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Light Law Group is a collection of
folks who care profoundly about their
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is true because I know the
folks from Green Light.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a huge difference between a big
legal firm who has decided to start
[SPEAKER_02]: representing a few drug companies versus
working with a collection of high
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity, passionate lawyers who are
personally interested in new plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines and firmly believe in their
power to heal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact Green Light Law Group today and
learn more about the services they can
[SPEAKER_02]: offer your industry leading cannabis or
psychedelics company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Green Light Law Group at

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we learned a lot
about bacteria generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then during the second set, we got really
specific about the rhizophagy cycle and
[SPEAKER_02]: how the bacteria is interacting with the
root zone of the plant, but also at the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of the plant too, which is
astonishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this third set, we are going to focus
more on how to use this understanding that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're starting to get about bacteria to
make our gardens more successful,
[SPEAKER_02]: higher yielding and resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna start, Jeff, with commercial
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you touched on it briefly earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have more to say about
it, but I know that you have mentioned to
[SPEAKER_02]: me time and time again that commercial
fertilizers that are not just straight up
[SPEAKER_02]: soil amendments, fertilizers that are
super nutritive because of how they were
[SPEAKER_02]: made actually inhibit the rhizophagy cycle
and generally make our plants like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: druggy salt dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to hear what you have to say
about how commercial fertilizers inhibit
[SPEAKER_02]: the rhizophagy cycle and what we should be
avoiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens when you put a
commercial fertilizer into the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: is you change the composition of that
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's salts, some of the
microbes, bacteria are killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water drains out of them to dilute the
salt and the salt goes into them in
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis and so they blow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other instances, there are microbes
that literally will go crazy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry chemical that you're synthetic
that you've put down and will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: composition or the ratio of the bacterium
and other microbes in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not good either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we wanna let the plant be in
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant should be able to choose what it
wants and get as much of what it wants
[SPEAKER_00]: when it wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you change the ratio,
when you kill off some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are needed, the plant has to react in a
way that either causes them to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce the exudate in order to
regenerate the microbe that it needs or
[SPEAKER_00]: just gives up or it just simply says,
I can coast along on what I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to do these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it loses the benefits of having an
endophyte causing stimulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the plant to be able to handle
stress better and all those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you end up with a weaker plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw in the fact that you've
started the path of destroying the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got 60 years left of soil using
the current techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we harvest and rototill,
we destroy the soil structure and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: headed to big trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna be the next generation
that's gonna suffer that trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why all of these bacterial
situations, rhizophagy, endophytes are I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the holy grail for the conversion of
chemical agriculture to the organic system
[SPEAKER_00]: that you and I know and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk primarily about natural farming
and regenerative gardening techniques on
[SPEAKER_02]: this show, but there's no doubt that we
are going to attract some people who use
[SPEAKER_02]: salt fertilizers for this episode because
the information is so rare to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm gonna ask you an impossible
question and say just like, just give me a
[SPEAKER_02]: taste for those people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the people who are here to learn
about bacteria, but they use salt
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers or AB style fertilizers,
or maybe they've got fields and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: using large branded commercial
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the alternative?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we trying to suggest that they
use instead of that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, well, of course, I've got a lot of
stuff at the end of the book that
[SPEAKER_00]: individual bacteriums names I can't
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people need to take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some very distinct kinds of
things that we can put on our plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: in our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them with regard to cannabis is
used for wheat and other things as
[SPEAKER_00]: Azospirillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can spray that on our plants and we
can water it down into our soil and it
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up helping the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to use a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a living bacterium supplying
the food that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cannabis growers are beginning to
do experiments with Azospirillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to adjust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you wouldn't want to use
neem oil because wouldn't the neem oil
[SPEAKER_00]: kill off whatever you're putting on your
phyllosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does neem oil maybe doesn't do such great
things for the bacterium in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a time when you need it,
perhaps, but not all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think we're going to have to
just do lots and lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing individual crops,
there are now, and again, I list some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the book, there are studies on
individual endophytes or groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes that help specific crops,
trees, vegetables, tomatoes, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're beginning to get a feel for the
kinds of bacteria we can add to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and to these plants and make things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me think about compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for years and years and years,
I've been using compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know compost teas work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done before and afters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done bad soil, good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of time people don't get results
with compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be because they've already
got all the components that the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea supplies to a system that doesn't have
all the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore they don't see any
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all tied together and there's going
to be tremendous amounts of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, to be able to go back to grad school
and study some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about that often on the show,
about what a great time it is to be
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody in their late teens or early
twenties and starting off with these
[SPEAKER_02]: interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because between the creeping normalization
and the access to lab equipment that we
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis folks have now, I mean,
we're about to enter the golden age of
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's also different qualities of
compost tea, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where a lot of people, they're relying on
compost tea, but then they put it on their
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope and it's nutrition,
but no life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just because something is called
compost tea, there is a difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: inert compost tea, a dead compost tea
that's just full of nutrition versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea that is chock full of all
these living bits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you can have dead soil,
which we generally call dirt, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's dirt that's not bioactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after you spend some time and you
start adding, you know, bacteria and
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium and compost teas and fortified it
properly, then you have living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So compost are in that same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to follow up with,
you know, are there particular things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can compost and make compost tea out of
that will be supportive of endophytic
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, compost is full of
endophytes and so is vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, the book talks a little
teeny bit about the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different sets in one versus the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you put into your compost is
going to end up with different stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the compost, as you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dream about what if I was able to
make a compost out of my cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: wastes and then use that on my cannabis,
doesn't that supply the right kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't know for sure,
but sure makes sense to me, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there are there are things
that we can be looking at in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the research that's coming and
the instrumentation that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: require in order to be able to tell
whether we're getting there is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean like the technology so that
we can measure this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can measure it now and it's
because millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just costs a lot of money to
send away a sample to get its DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting cheaper and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so now we're all in love with
endophytic bacteria and we want to attract
[SPEAKER_02]: as much of it as we can to our root zone
by using natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to apply endophytic
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, can we can we can we amend
with endophytic bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you the easiest example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizobium, you know, the the the nitrogen
fixing bacteria that form nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's that's we apply
that those bacteria as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, I might add, end up inside a
little nodule in the plant that those are
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yes, we're going to be able to
supply them like like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are there is even a series of
discussions about being able to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic bacteria that can live in the
in the plant, jump off the plant and kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds that are around the plant and
then jump back into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all of these things are coming
and we just have to be able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. James White could tell you,
as can a handful of scientists around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, that if you apply X, Y bacteria to
wheat, you end up with better wheat or ZD
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria to bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with better bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research simply hasn't been done on
the cannabis because of the laws that we
[SPEAKER_00]: face in the United States about to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my dear classmate Chuck Schumer has his
way, we're going to have good research on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the biggest things they
ought to be researching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does the nitrogen fixing that we in
cannabis cultivation do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How, you know, most people call it cover
crops, even though that that word doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, we we we grow something
on the top and then we chop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let it drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we cover it with some compost or
some more soil so that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant itself is pulling nitrogen from
the air and then putting it down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that makes the the nitrogen
available to other participants in the in
[SPEAKER_02]: the container or in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're on a field, how does this sort
of nitrogen fixing play a role in this
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't we don't call it nitrogen
fixing, but that's what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: these rhizothagy bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fixing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And giving it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the endosymbiosis in the
in the in the phyllosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those bacteria inside those
trichomes are fixing nitrogen and giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, what we what we really
want to do is be able to introduce these
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of nitrogen fixing bacteria that
don't necessarily form nodules into
[SPEAKER_00]: various kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're you know, Bayer and all those
big guys, you know, who who who we accuse
[SPEAKER_00]: of all sorts of terrible things because
they do some terrible things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're studying all this stuff like crazy
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would predict at some point in time
that's what they'll be selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'll be selling bacteria that
can go into a plant or fungi that can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already sell, you know, mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go into the plant and fix
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be incredible if you if you
could grow a tomato plant or a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant without adding any nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got enough fixation going
on right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who haven't picked it up out of
context yet, would you define
[SPEAKER_02]: phyllosphere, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phyllosphere is the is the rhizosphere
around the leaf is that is that area along
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf surface where there's microbes
and dust and, you know, little little
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's we call it the rhizosphere
around the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the phyllosphere around around
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's primarily where the bacteria
that finds its way into our seeds to start
[SPEAKER_02]: the next generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it comes from is the
phyllosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so this the seed is being formed in the
flower and the bacteria that is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, which is, you know, I'm sure
there's some variety, but it's also the
[SPEAKER_02]: same bacterias that are in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's jumping into that seed, if you will,
so that it is present when the seed is
[SPEAKER_02]: germinated down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both both are both go into the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's capable,
you're capable of taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil bacteria that become endophytes
and go in, they can move through the flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they can move around inside the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do move around inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, so you get it's called
vertical and horizontal transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so is definitely get some from
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that we can do to
attract more beneficial bacteria to the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if the like, other than having a
healthy plant, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like some people, right,
they just they want to they want to dump
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses on everything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, you know, and then, you know,
I am probably more in a category that I
[SPEAKER_02]: use too much commercial Korean natural
farming preps, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they say one one to 1000, I'm loving it
at one at 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I shouldn't be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really hard not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so in that kind of dumb mindset,
I asked this question, and perhaps there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a smart answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that we can top amend
along the stem of the plant that will find
[SPEAKER_02]: its way down to the root zone that will,
you know, bring in more beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, an area where some great
research has to be done, but using soil
[SPEAKER_00]: from old growth cannabis, and putting that
down as a as a way of transferring the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium that bacteria that were produced
on that previous plant is probably the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great, great reason to, you know,
reuse last year's pots, keep your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the whole no till vibe that
that, you know, right, we're strong
[SPEAKER_02]: proponents of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes one step even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could, you could actually take
some of that soil from a pot and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a new pot, as opposed to planting the
seed in the old pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, you can you can you can use it as a
top dress, like you would compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's let's flip that risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been talking about things to do
to preserve to preserve the excuse me to
[SPEAKER_02]: attract more bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the actions that we can take that
will kill all the bacteria in the pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming like at the top of the list
is heat and water, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so what are those variables?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even even with regard to heat,
a lot of these things will will form,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, into into kind of words,
the system, endospores, endospores,
[SPEAKER_00]: endospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form endospores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to withstand the heat,
which is how a lot of the bacterium that
[SPEAKER_00]: we like go through the composting process
and still survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, you've got you've got
that situation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to ask you another question
that you may not have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a follow up to the heat one,
though.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so those of us who are in containers
are our soil is at much more risk than
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are in the actual ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots can go deep where it's cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the geothermal advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful both during the summer and
in the fall when it starts to cool down
[SPEAKER_02]: and the roots are kept warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but lots of us are in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on a day where it's like, you know,
ninety five to one hundred and a five,
[SPEAKER_02]: the the plant containers cook just sitting
in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're in a greenhouse that's not
supported with air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might even be even hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an idea how much heat it's
going to take before the bacteria start to
[SPEAKER_02]: cyst up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, OK, they might be able to
survive the heat, but we don't want them
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to go through all of that hassle
of cysting up and then and then realizing
[SPEAKER_02]: it's safe again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then, you know, like we're
slowing down our plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious on these days that that
it's, you know, ninety five to one hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: and five and our and our our containers
are getting really hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I wiping out my bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know the real answer is,
you know, intuitively it seems to me that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are going into a dormant
situation as a result of the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder whether the plant adjusts,
exudates, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be able to try to fix that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the thing that controls how
well a plant grows temperature wise is the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymatic activity inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's around I think it's seventy six
to seventy nine degrees is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has more to do with the enzymes
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those enzymes are obviously
produced by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I hate to give the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: More research.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you we've we've all been reading
you for so long and you've done so much
[SPEAKER_02]: research both on bacteria generally and
also our favorite plant, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, that if somebody is going to make
an educated guess, I'm comfortable with it
[SPEAKER_02]: being you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I would be a lot more
suspicious of like generalized bro science
[SPEAKER_02]: that someone learned by, you know,
from somebody who taught them to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I certainly know I got a bunch of
bad information from my mentor,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though I got a lot of great
information, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're kind of at the point in in
cannabis culture where we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out which is which.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a similar question, slightly
twisted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so far, we've talked about all these
things that we can do to encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that there are beneficial
bacterias and then pathogenic bacterias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there things that we can do to keep
bad bacteria from invading to limit it
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there must be, which is why
people keep sterile, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile, their greenhouse situation,
they don't let any, you know, any insects
[SPEAKER_00]: in the convector, bad bacteria,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't smoke inside the,
you know, touch tobacco, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's so you can clearly spread
these bacteria around.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably have to be very,
very careful not you don't probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be careful not to bring in a bad a bad
bacterium, you know, that might cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a mildew, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although those are usually fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to, you know,
cause some real serious problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, I don't think it happens that
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And camping off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we also this is yet another
reason to keep a clean, a clean growing
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning your tools, cleaning the floor,
you know, not taking things off the floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it in your pot, things like that
as well, because we don't want to upset
[SPEAKER_02]: the balance between the beneficial
bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even even things like, you know,
I talked a little bit about it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: book, it's sort of counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you harvest your plants for seeds,
as opposed to harvesting it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the cannabis content,
you know, how do those seeds normally
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: We you know, we tend to take those seeds
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we let the plant fall to the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, prepare the seed
even more for growth, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's something to be thinking
about because there's bacteria everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I like the idea of letting
my letting my plants mature to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where the the flowers fall off and the
seeds get a little dirty in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they pick up a little bit
more bacteria, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of an interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's thinking of the seeds,
by the way, we did we talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: because you mentioned the heat,
you know, the idea that we dry our seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out, we usually put seeds into a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in this little packet that we got
from an old film canister or or a boveda,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to dry out the Oh, you're
talking about desiccant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, desiccant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, desiccant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want we want those bacteria to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're living inside those those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't want them to live to the
point where they cause germination,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or where they multiply like
crazy and cause things to go nuts inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those seed coats actually let in
oxygen, a little bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't want to let the seeds sit
in hot and in in dry, dry situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, things I sort of picked up out of
the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where would you Yeah, well,
that was headed there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you recommend storing them then?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most people keep them either in
the fridge or the freezer to to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stall biological activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think the fridge is
probably okay freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether this that's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, so again, you know,
the ultimate answer is research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep mining room temperature in a
container that's not necessarily fully
[SPEAKER_02]: airtight, not necessarily fully airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I keep it or if I keep it in
something like a film camp, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a film canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use it to sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as like, I want to hit one one one
thing that you just said about having the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds dropped to the ground, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I understand already that you're
probably going to say the answer is more
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your your your thought process through
that is that when we are making seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile environments, we might be missing
out on some, you know, bacterial or fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: or some kind of protections that come from
the the the seeds falling either out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower or the plant collapsing onto
the ground, and then interacting with the
[SPEAKER_02]: biology of the of the topsoil is,
I think that's where you're headed with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and if we're in if we're,
you know, if we're kind of stacking your
[SPEAKER_02]: estimated guesses right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have ideas of what those would be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think they would be more
bacterial or more fungal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like, what are you you've
researched?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your rift?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what are you gonna riff on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they I think they'd be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they'd be both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting, some of the
some of the Razafagi microorganisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to bacteria are yeasts,
which are fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, they they bleed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they bud as they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens to these L forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bud like like like fungi in the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That word bleed is worth pointing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it and you didn't say bleed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually bleeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I read it in the book,
I'm like, well, that there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: weird word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a couple of good crossword
words in this book, not to mention all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I should mention just quickly
that there are these bacteria names are so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ones,
you know, that I go out of my way to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't memorize anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to the end of the
book, you get a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff is in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you when you need to look it up,
you can go look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we're headed, I think, is a
situation where we're going to have labels
[SPEAKER_00]: for products that we're going to be able
to buy that can contain various different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you'll be able to go to the
index of the book and say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the one I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can buy as a beryllium now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a bunch of these things
that I mentioned in the book that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: buy on a farmer level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I have trouble finding them,
but it's beginning to trickle down into
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as more and more people, including
farmers, understand rhizophagy,
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more of this stuff will become
available and used in general farming and
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned this aside in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you're talking about
fertilizers in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you point out that phosphorus is no
longer allowed in many formulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say buy NPK fertilizers,
question mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had not since I don't use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really I wasn't aware.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're reaching feet peak phosphate
phosphorus on this earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think we get, you know,
60, 70 years left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and partly as a result of that,
partly as a result of the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus has caused so much pollution in
terms of our water systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: eutrophication, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And partly because it's so locked up in
the soil so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are many people's soil already
contains phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can no longer buy lawn food in,
I think, almost every state with a middle
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not zero that you just can't buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no phosphorus lawn food anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken that middle number out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the reasons mentioned,
it's a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already there and we're running out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it's it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the end of end of this is that the
acidic situation enhances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these bacteria, as we noted
before, are our our our phosphates,
[SPEAKER_00]: stylizing and encouraging the use of or
the breakdown of phosphate, bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fungi, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get our phosphates as a
result of our fungi and our bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so as far as like final thoughts go,
Jeff, you know, I was going to set you up
[SPEAKER_02]: here at the end With what you actually
ended up opening the interview with about
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching bacteria in schools and how they
they taught they teach so much about
[SPEAKER_02]: dinosaurs and yet we don't have those
except for maybe chickens and and yet and
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, you know bacteria is is everywhere
and and kids don't learn anything about it
[SPEAKER_02]: really and so I just wanted to know I
think I know that you are Having read the
[SPEAKER_02]: book and and it really does capture your
personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many So many jokes and
puns and offhand things here and there you
[SPEAKER_02]: can really tell that when you write a book
you really embrace it and become it and so
[SPEAKER_02]: and so so to to wrap up I just want to
hear you know what your message is about
[SPEAKER_02]: the the realization that the Rise of haji
cycle exists coming since 2008 and our new
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness of bacteria from from from James
White that like he's had, you know having
[SPEAKER_02]: a hard time getting the message out and
yet now here your book is going to present
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria in living soil and its role in
the soil food web in a way that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: reach an entirely different audience as
the other books in your series have done
[SPEAKER_02]: So so when you when you wrap us up with a
summation here of your thoughts and your
[SPEAKER_02]: vibes Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know this book was so much fun
to write because it was such new
[SPEAKER_00]: information to me And and and I'm just a
gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I write these books for
gardeners you and me and cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_00]: or gardeners, etc, etc And I just the more
I got into it the more excited I got about
[SPEAKER_00]: it partly because I don't know anything
about back to you know I didn't learn an
[SPEAKER_00]: awful lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too damn small for people to
study in high school That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when I came across a quote from a
song by a guy named Andy McKinnon McKinnon
[SPEAKER_00]: From Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He I think he's from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the Washington State Native Plant
Society member It's sort of encapsulated
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulated everything for me and lately
I've been catching my wife Going around
[SPEAKER_00]: singing this little this little little
ditty and it goes I feel it in my branches
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it in my roots endo fights are in
me from my flowers to my roots and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are they're everywhere and because they're
small Bacterium there's billions of them
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and they're doing so much
important work that we don't know about
[SPEAKER_00]: and can't see But we can feel that it's
going on and so it's really really
[SPEAKER_00]: important that we as growers Carry that
feeling forward I mean what what I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get people to do is pay attention to these
unusual things that are going on inside
[SPEAKER_00]: plants these are not dumb inanimate
telephone poles sitting in the ground just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't walk and run and Punch
people in the face and do all this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that they're these stupid inanimate
objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Fascinating and they've learned to
cooperate with the microbes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria is one of you know The the main
one that I'm talking about obviously in
[SPEAKER_00]: the book in a way that is so Fascinating
that it makes them different entities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're you know You shouldn't
be looking at your plant for the flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: for the leaf You should be looking at your
plant for the processes that go on that
[SPEAKER_00]: make that flower and make that leaf That's
what that's what it's all about not the
[SPEAKER_02]: end result that you can harvest Thank you
so much Jeff for returning to shaping fire
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have a great time whenever we
talk whether or not it's you know at a
[SPEAKER_02]: conference or somewhere where our paths
cross or or the times that we You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we really focus and talk like this It's
always such a joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I had the smile on my face throughout,
you know almost the entire time and And
[SPEAKER_02]: and thank you for the role you played in
translating a lot of this heavy-duty
[SPEAKER_02]: science Into terms and stories and
anecdotes that lay folk like me who are
[SPEAKER_02]: very interested but don't have a hard
science background Are able to enjoy it
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves so that we can use it,
you know for our garden To to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and for the you know,
regenerative good of the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you my friend Yeah, I certainly
appreciate the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have a great time and I look
forward to doing it again as people
[SPEAKER_00]: develop more questions and as more and
more information is discovered about these
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic bacteria fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so if this is your first time
learning of Jeff Lowenfels, you are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not following his Instagram yet,
which is one of the best ways Jeff doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have like a huge online life but if you
want to follow along it is a good place to
[SPEAKER_02]: go and Jeff's Instagram is Gardener Jeff
really simple Gardener Jeff, but more
[SPEAKER_02]: importantly now perhaps you would like to
read the book which like I said We're
[SPEAKER_02]: really you know, we kind of hit it
superficially yet lovingly in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know a little bit more than an hour
and a half and if you want to get it You
[SPEAKER_02]: can get it on Amazon now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is in pre-release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess they're like pre-orders right
now It actually comes out physically on
[SPEAKER_02]: September 27th and the the title of it is
teaming with bacteria and and and so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can just search that but Sometimes it
doesn't come up as quickly in the search
[SPEAKER_02]: box since it hasn't been released yet So
there's also a direct link on the shaping
[SPEAKER_02]: fire website for this episode That's
teaming with bacteria and while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: there if you have not read them yet Go
