[SPEAKER_00]: So hey Eric, it's great to run into you
today at NCIA here in San Jose and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know everybody kind of got freaked out and
surprised to find out that you're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer at Forever Flowering Greenhouses
because we all know you like you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: every convention and you know we all know
you as being the person who built you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Flowering into the epic thing it
is by being everywhere but now you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: there anymore and so I'm glad I ran into
you because I wanted to know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: up to now and after talking with you for a
little bit it sounds like you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities but you're also looking for
some kind of opportunities so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to take a second and find out what
you're up to and let everybody know so
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know like everybody who's
watching is on your team right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you got going on now post
Forever Flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I appreciate you saying all that
stuff and I appreciate everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I took a job with a distribution
company and so I'm actually going out farm
[SPEAKER_01]: to farm sourcing trim at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all kinds of things but my job
primarily at the moment is to find trim so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm connected with a lot of farms and the
funny thing is as farms I normally
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't connect with I don't believe I'm
now connecting with because of my
[SPEAKER_01]: notoriety I guess you could say and so
being able to connect with those farms has
[SPEAKER_01]: been kind of cool because now I'm actually
seeing a side of people and things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: normally wouldn't see when I was with that
company and then it also turns into
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about greenhouses a lot and so now
a lot of people have searched out for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to still get greenhouse advice and so not
that I like the word consultant I like
[SPEAKER_01]: more of strategy or advisory those kind of
words but people still want my opinion and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm willing to give that opinion and of
course I want to monetize it so I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in trying to sell or
resell goods as much as I'm happy to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the advice and we're working with a lot of
the connections that I have in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and even in the community to help
farmers in whatever capacity they request.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of got like two hustles going
right now you've got the sourcing trim for
[SPEAKER_00]: Business Farmer One and then obviously
people are going to be asking you about
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses like probably forever now
right because you're industry expert so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the trim first right so
what kind of opportunities like are you
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for people who have got their
license and have got trim that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell on the open market is that is that
the kind of people you're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's kind of fun because you know
managing a company for 11 years like I did
[SPEAKER_01]: came with a lot of pressures of you know a
lot of decisions to make and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that so basically now it's kind of
listening to what other people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and just going out and doing something
that is really kind of fun in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not selling something now I'm
trying to buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I'm connecting with the same
group of people if not the same people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've connected with before so it's on
a different level for a different purpose
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's still within my community that I
love so much and the people that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: trust and support me as well that are
coming out and you know it might not be a
[SPEAKER_01]: career move sounding like oh you went from
managing a company to picking up trim or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever but like I said without taking a
break this was a quick way to jump into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I feel like I can you know
bring value to and also do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: job at and not have to really think and
make so many critical decisions you know
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe sleep better at night in some cases
so a lot of that stress is relieved and
[SPEAKER_01]: now going out and doing that's been kind
of fun but like I said now I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: hired to actually going to Vegas next week
to consult on a greenhouse project that
[SPEAKER_01]: merely want my advice they don't really
need to buy anything from me but they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick my brain and they're willing to
pay me for it and so I figured out a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up with a rake sheet that kind of
discusses a few different services whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's giving a presentation to helping
people that have never understood or dealt
[SPEAKER_01]: with the greenhouse before to people that
are already on their way into it and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest one now is greenhouse rescue
there's so many greenhouse people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: either getting into an existing one or
built one and maybe don't have the right
[SPEAKER_01]: head grow or maybe they are putting the
pieces together properly working hard or
[SPEAKER_01]: not smarter a lot of those things I can
address fairly easily and it's something I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I'm pretty good at and so the
greenhouse rescue in a lot of capacities
[SPEAKER_01]: is a new thing that I'm you know kind of
coining and taking off you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually makes a lot of sense too because
when you were a guest on my shaving fire
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast one of the things like you kept on
coming back to is a lot of your job was
[SPEAKER_00]: just stopping people from doing the stuff
they were doing wrong right it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the greenhouse itself you know if you
if you build it right you're in good shape
[SPEAKER_00]: but then when how people choose to use it
you know gets them in all sorts of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: right down to using black fabric bags
instead of brown right it was amazing over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of the last year so the people
that I've met and went to farms that had
[SPEAKER_01]: our greenhouses I felt like understood
what we were all about or the message that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was laying down and I came to the
realization that a lot of people didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: quite I mean they bought product or
greenhouses from me and things but they
[SPEAKER_01]: still didn't quite get the concept and so
I feel like I'm still saying the same
[SPEAKER_01]: story and trying to hold the same space
that I did before because that information
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like is vital and it's still the
same information that's helping people but
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said you know even people that I'm
the closest to might not have seen my
[SPEAKER_01]: presentations or heard my message before
so anybody can avoid hearing you because
[SPEAKER_01]: you were everywhere I thought and I feel
like sometimes I feel like I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere and said it and other times I
felt like man nobody's heard anything
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm out here just repeating myself
and going over a lot of the same same
[SPEAKER_01]: things you know with the greenhouses the
ground covers the colors the clear skins
[SPEAKER_01]: different little things trapping air and
the default is to turn on a fan rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than open it up and stop trapping air so I
mean it's just methods to the madness and
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately in California we lost a lot
of brands or people that were originally
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneering people or companies due to
regulations so with those people being
[SPEAKER_01]: gone we have a whole new crop of people
that in some ways need that education our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has got such churn dude it's
looks like more and then you know got all
[SPEAKER_00]: these new states coming online yeah and
then since you did I mean you did my show
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple times but but you know you're
kind of everywhere right you did
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's tried to be yeah so so there's
people who are coming across you as the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse expert in everybody's back
catalog right I think you're on my show
[SPEAKER_00]: like like a year and a half ago right
people still write to me to say oh my god
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a great show like how do we get
in contact with you know yeah and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know as people come across all the media
that you've been in I can imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: still calling you up you know thinking
you're still where you were but you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: like no freelance now baby like let me
solve your problems for cheaper you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got a mix of that here today I saw
people that knew or followed kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: story or kind of saw how things were going
in my transition and gave me a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: accolades and support today and then there
was people that didn't know and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: today and like I was saying people just
want to hear the advice or work with me in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense that I do have a lot of
connections to source a lot of things to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a business work or to fix a business
that's having problems yeah and actually I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard you say that stuff a couple times to
people like bring people up to speed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm like you know you and I have
been pals for a while now but I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was very honorable that you weren't
talking any shit about your old employer
[SPEAKER_00]: right like like a lot of people like you
know when they're not somewhere anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: they talk a lot of crap right put them on
blast yeah totally and that's that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: your way you're just like you know parting
the ways doing my own thing now yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of honor in that well I
appreciate that I mean I tried to do my
[SPEAKER_01]: best in the 11 years that I was there and
treated like it was my own company and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was a partial owner wasn't a majority
owner and you know after 11 years my time
[SPEAKER_01]: is calm I guess you could say and so it's
actually been a nice breath of fresh air
[SPEAKER_01]: even though transitions can be tough but
you know the cannabis industry still has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to offer for people and I'm glad that
I've been here so long so that I do have
[SPEAKER_01]: these connections and the people around me
that are supportive and appreciative of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you know like it's hard to believe
how appreciative people are to my
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment to the community and the
industry well also you're a giver right
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know yeah I mean like you and I
hit it off right away but there's no doubt
[SPEAKER_00]: man you introduced me to people at Emerald
Cubs you opened doors for me you told
[SPEAKER_00]: people like yeah he's not he's not a local
humble guy but he's okay you know and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you do that to all sorts of for
all sorts of folks and so you know just
[SPEAKER_00]: like why I hunted you down today you know
like you know people want to give back
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah and I don't do it for everybody
but I definitely do it for the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the same community spirit the
passion for the plant you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I think we can see each other you
know through a crowd sometimes and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: out who's who even from being outside
blazing a duty yeah standing in line at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bar yeah right and so you know some of
those things give it that community effort
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're really a part of and makes us
remember and see each other every time
[SPEAKER_01]: we're here versus being at the bar you
know maybe remember each other it's
[SPEAKER_01]: usually not for the same meaning that we
put to it why we're here yeah totally yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so um so let's wrap this up by talking
about like the kind of opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for right because kind of
the goal of my you know me doing this is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to get you plugged in
replugged in a new ways right and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: got the trim thing going on should people
reach out to you if they have trim for
[SPEAKER_01]: sale yeah definitely so what are you
looking for specifically I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: state-permitted trim and it can be in
various quality there's a various price
[SPEAKER_01]: range for that quality it needs to pass
testing for contaminants it's microprocess
[SPEAKER_01]: so they test it for everything and even
the returns and then we basically
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantine it for two weeks while the
testing is going on and then we come out
[SPEAKER_01]: and cash out on the spot we can even do
wire transfers so it's not a terms of 30
[SPEAKER_01]: or 45 days or any of these other things
yes the testing give us a minute we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: right back and then we cash out and that
works really well and it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to what I'm hearing pretty good
opportunity and then with the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting I'm creating a rate card that's
gonna have different services on different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways for people to basically utilize my
information and my connections within the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and so like as far as the
greenhouses people should contact you if
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are considering a greenhouse and
they want to understand it better and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to think about what vendor to go to
and if they've got a greenhouse that's
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe underperforming or they want it to
perform better or they've got like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when greenhouses go bad and they've
got a situation it's like everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like the greenhouse save king
because you're always out at greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing like worst-case scenarios all true
yeah and it's all been cannabis that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing like there's plenty of
greenhouse experts and greenhouse people
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that know way more than me I'm
sure and the thing that I know is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis side of everything related to
greenhouses for more than 11 years because
[SPEAKER_01]: when I moved to Humboldt in 1992 I was
really chasing down cannabis more than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything black boxing and light depth was
part of that greenhouses eventually became
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that yeah I turned it into a
career for the last 11 years so it put me
[SPEAKER_01]: really on the spot for you know ground
zero for cannabis greenhouses and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: all the stumbling blocks and things that
people go through and really they're
[SPEAKER_01]: usually right there if we switch a couple
things up or layer things a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more properly things can take off pretty
quickly so I'm there and I can be there
[SPEAKER_01]: for the long haul or I can be there for
the one day you know here's what I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say and sometimes that's a vetting process
too but like you said I've been around a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while and I do have some good
references to go yeah totally yeah all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so then so then you got the trim in
the greenhouses are you also like open for
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities like like if somebody had
like oh my god Eric Branson would be
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for this position is like like
like if people have got like you know job
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities do you want to hear about
those two yeah I'd love to hear from those
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always down to hear about what's going
on I'm always excited to hear what other
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are doing I like to be
innovative and creative at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: so I mean that's the thing about this
industry it's still blossoming and
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding yeah so my whole thing is you
know I love to see opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody and I always try to create it
for other people as well even if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working with them or for them and so I
feel like if somebody has that maybe for
[SPEAKER_00]: me I'm willing to look all right yeah for
sure all right so then how do people get a
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of you if they've got one of these
things they want to talk to you about if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the trim I'm Eric er IC at boxcar

farms right on you want to plug your
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram too oh yeah it's like depth

[SPEAKER_01]: account I'm still you know answering DMS
and you know trying to build up my account
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not what it used to be but at the
same time I'm still trying to provide a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that info that I did before because
I'm still going out to greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_01]: creating that content and things like that
so I'm trying to make it available for
[SPEAKER_00]: people you know for free too yeah right on
