[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeff, you know, there are lots of
variety of microbes in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are allies for the
cannabis plant, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic and could cause harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all wanting to grow the number
and variety of microbes in our soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't necessarily want to feed the
pathogenic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your recommendations for us to
feed and encourage the helpful microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: without feeding the pathogenic ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure I have a great answer,
but it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The overall answer is to make sure that
your soil is well aerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have anaerobic pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have them anyway because
they're all over the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't want your soil to become
anaerobic, any more than you want your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost pile to become anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pathogens tend to be anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the aerobic microbes, the ones that
rely on oxygen, tend not to be pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so keeping the soil well aerated,
good soil structure is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's sort of, again,
the overreaching answer is you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure everything is well aerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put compost teas down,
you want to make sure they're aerated
[SPEAKER_02]: compost teas, not anaerobic compost teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the soil itself, you should
take into some consideration a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people won't use manures in their
composts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use manures in my compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why people use manures in
compost is because that's how people got
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all had horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all had carriages and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you go out and find manures now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, you can make
compost without manures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use leaf clippings and grass
clippings and you don't have a dog in the
[SPEAKER_02]: yard, chances are you have fewer E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli in that compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's sort of the second half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful what you put in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there again, you want to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy soil from someplace and you use
manure in your compost and there are a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of medicines that go into the animals that
produce that stuff, you might have some
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure your compost is
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't any spots that weren't
composted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, aeration tends to cure and
correct a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, ventilation, by the way,
is a form of aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that note, I still just consider
myself a novice cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I often will still get compacted
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes a hydrophobic top,
so the water just runs off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand aerated teas, because I
use aerated compost teas all summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do to aerate the soil once
it's already compacted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're going in containers,
first of all, I leave the old plant in the
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I put the new plant in,
the roots will grow down the same zones as
[SPEAKER_02]: the old roots there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes it easier for the plant to
expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost itself will aerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbes will move the compost down
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with a little light
actual aeration, like you were aerating a
[SPEAKER_02]: lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like taking a screwdriver and just
sticking it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A screwdriver's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a toothpick.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not a toothpick.
[SPEAKER_02]: A chopstick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stick it in a couple of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to do it all over the place
and screw up the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's nothing wrong with doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got to go back and take a
look and see what your practices are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it getting compacted?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be you're walking around the
stuff too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you need the mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mulch will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your soil needs to be changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aeration's the key, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think about this solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend recommended me once.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, last summer, had this
compacted pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, listen, it's only a 10
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have a lot of room to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't holding onto the sides
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he recommended we just pull the pot
out and cut off about the last third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluff up the bottom of the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in some fresh, properly structured
soil from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put the plant back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the new roots grow into that soil,
it will kind of give the pot a new sense
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you buy that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd rather go out and get a 14
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put the soil around the existing root
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you cut that root ball,
cut off that root ball, you're impacting
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability of the leaves to take up the
nutrients that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the least disturbance to
the roots as possible is the key thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd just get a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
