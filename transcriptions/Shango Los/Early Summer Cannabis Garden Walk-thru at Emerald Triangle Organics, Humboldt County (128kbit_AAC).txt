[SPEAKER_00]: So, Matt, why don't you give us a little
walkthrough of the front part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden here?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got some South Fork seeds,
some genetics we got from our boys over in
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are dirty cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one right here is a Sherbrooke
bloodhound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a Golden Lemons cross
with bloodhound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some what are those called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unicorn farts from Eric at HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some, what else we got back
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really nice Diamond Masters from HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some Zookies from the boys over in
the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started all these in, what did we
start?
[SPEAKER_01]: These April 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we started them in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put them outside April 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the unicorn farts from HBK.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's getting big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and chirpy smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some Diamond Masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a OG Respect from South Fork
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run a lot of South Fork seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their genetics do great over here on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty local too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to use somebody who's
breeding their stuff in your same bio
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin from Wonderland nursery put us on to
South Fork seeds a couple years ago and we
[SPEAKER_01]: fell in love with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we rock them pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice seeing you.
Thanks for the walkthrough.
