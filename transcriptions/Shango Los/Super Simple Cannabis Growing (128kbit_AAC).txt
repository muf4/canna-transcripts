[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you who have been to Vimeo
meetings, but not the very first ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how we used to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early days when our goal was to
help people find out whether or not they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to apply for a license,
it was simply 15 or 20 of us sitting in
[SPEAKER_01]: this room and we just kind of teaching the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the wave of licenses came
out, we still wanted to get together and
[SPEAKER_01]: so we started bringing in some of the top
speakers in the world to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of them are here tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried to do this other years with
different speakers because the goal was to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a speaker at the beginning of the
season to present a really easy strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: for growing that anybody could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last two years when we had those
speakers, they did great presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they very quickly got above the
beginners headspace because they
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves were so pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this year instead of booking
someone to do the presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured since I keep on thinking I know
how to do it right, I might as well just
[SPEAKER_01]: do it myself this year and present the
super simple beginner's guide to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's going to happen this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are some immediate
assumptions going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one, we're assuming that you're
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all about having some plants in
your yard for the summer, growing it under
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not going to talk anything
about indoor growing specifically even
[SPEAKER_01]: though some of it can be cross applied
very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, we're also assuming that you're
growing for yourself and not for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, that's legally safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sticky to suggest that I'm going to
try to teach you how to grow commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, I'm not going to be
teaching how to grow in volume or
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily how to grow for the best
looking in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking for you to have the skill
set to grow for your own usage to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: relief that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to be teaching another
assumption is that we're doing this for
[SPEAKER_01]: easiness over production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking for the easiest route at
every turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's certainly things that you
can do to get bigger plants with more on
[SPEAKER_01]: them and the way it goes to make more
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not really what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing is we're trying to make
it simple so that everybody can have an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, I recognize a lot of the
established growers in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all know more than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the past, that's been part of the
problem is because people have started to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk over their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a grower in the room,
I know that there are different ways to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there are better ways to
do a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not our goal today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about me trying to impress with
what I know about advanced growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about simplifying it so everybody
in the room can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so with those assumptions in
hand, part one, do you really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the law says right now, if you do not
have a medical authorization, you do not
[SPEAKER_01]: have any right in the state of Washington
to grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a medical authorization,
you can grow four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a medical authorization and
you choose to sell or sign up for the
[SPEAKER_01]: state registry, your four plants become
six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a medical authorization and
you're on the registry and your doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: writes in at the bottom of your license
and of your authorization, you can grow up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best possible scenario that is
legal for you is if you have a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization and it's on the new form and
at the bottom your doctor has written that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have up to 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the maximum that you can have
on your parcels, 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you don't have a medical
authorization, there is a possibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: though it's remote, that the Washington
legislature will pass personal grows here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Washington like they have in other
legalized states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't hold my breath for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we see is that every year more
individual Americans are choosing to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of what their state law is
because they feel they should be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I'm not here to give you legal
advice, I would say that what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching here tonight can be used in the
face of your state laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your discretion and figure out how
much risk you're willing to go for in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to provide your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on Bashon, the only place to get
medical cannabis is about to close because
[SPEAKER_01]: as of July 1st, all the dispensaries in
the state have got to close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we are such a small population
and most of us grow for ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a while before we get a
recreational store on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that after July 1st,
you can either go over town and shop at a
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, or that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why a lot of people have been
asking me about simple basics in growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is why we are getting together
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your family and your neighbors probably
have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have neighbors who might give you
a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have family who come over for
your barbecue this summer and they might
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that in advance because once
it's happening, it's not that positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be a big deal for you,
but think about that in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also consider that you might want to
stand with the plant and even though your
[SPEAKER_01]: aunt or your friend or your neighbor might
have a little bit of a problem and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got three plants on your porch,
maybe consider just being okay with that
[SPEAKER_01]: and causing a conversation that might open
up somebody's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you decide, make sure you
consider it before you go in and put in
[SPEAKER_01]: all the work that it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part two, where to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things to consider are
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cite from Passersby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a classic sad story and they're
known as rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who go past your garden every day
and they see your cannabis plants growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and they know just enough that if they
wait until the end of September or the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of October, they can stop by
your place and pick up your plant right
[SPEAKER_01]: before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a drag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is important to place your
plants somewhere out of line of sight from
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are passing your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, you're also going to want to do it
close to water and you'll understand why
[SPEAKER_01]: after you grow for the first time because
you're going to be bringing water over
[SPEAKER_01]: there all the time for the entirety of the
summer, like pretty much through
[SPEAKER_01]: Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bringing water to your plants,
Mother's Day through Halloween,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense to have a plan to have
the water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had it be a location that you remember
exists so that you don't forget that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly common for people to say,
oh, I went over town and then the next day
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a family party and then,
oh my gosh, I haven't watered my plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: three days and the weather's been so
great, did you go back there and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is burned and irreverently damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure that you're
putting it out of sight of passersby so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't get ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you want to put it
somewhere where it will be an eye shot for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself so that you remember to tend it
since you're just building these habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer love cannabis and its vegetation
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to prefer some strange more than
others, but they really like just to bite
[SPEAKER_01]: that top green, delicious top of the
vegetating plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so recognize that if you have a garden
with a deer fence, as many of us do here
[SPEAKER_01]: on Bachelot Island, I encourage you to
consider putting your plants in behind
[SPEAKER_01]: your deer fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is incredibly common for people to grow
outside of a deer fence and have no
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, especially if you don't have deer
and instead you have more coyotes on the
[SPEAKER_01]: island.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be aware of that possibility because
it would be a shame for your plants to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point where they're just about to
start blooming and you come outside and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been chomped and they'll still
grow, but it really impedes your success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are all things that you want to
consider when choosing where to grow your
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is the decision of do you want to go
into the grove?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go into the ground or do
you want to go into a container?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a couple different things to
consider here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, the ground is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the natural microbial life that
exists in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots can go as far as it wants to
into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows your plant to really stretch
up because it's got this fantastic base to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold itself steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard part is though, is that when
you're in the ground you can't move the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the challenges that we have
here in the Northwest generally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely on Bashon Island,
is most of the different strains or
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars of plants that are available to
us in the Northwest, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish blooming until probably the first
to third week of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky and you get a strain like
this, like schisca berry or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that that blooms in six weeks,
you might be out and done by the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: September.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more often than not, you're going to
be looking at your plant the first week in
[SPEAKER_01]: October trying to decide to cut it because
you're looking at your phone and it says
[SPEAKER_01]: rain and fall for the next three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in the ground, that decision
becomes a lot more difficult because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have less flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, containers are really,
really convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow in any container that's at
least five gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move it around your yard if you
need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some small growers on the island even have
gotten a special hand truck just for
[SPEAKER_01]: moving their plants around their yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the more resourceful folks
that I've met, they'll have three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: plants on their patio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll get one of those circular
trays with wheels on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're sliding it all around
their deck depending on where the sun is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's raining, you slide it
underneath the roof doohickey over your
[SPEAKER_01]: deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty great plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the ground, you better plan
on covering your plant at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's lots of ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen creatively placed beach
umbrellas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen thick plastic misclean bought
from Home Depot that has been attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: the house and then brought down at an
angle for poles over the plants so that
[SPEAKER_01]: the rain sheets off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you even have some kind of structure
outside that you can rig with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really want to think about this
ahead of time because our weather normally
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to be threatening before the
plants are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that Bashan growers
have been having to deal with since the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not old, and this is not a new
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do think about it ahead of time,
especially if you're going to go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you're in the ground,
you're there for keeps.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on to soil and nutrients,
also known as part three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different strategies
for building your own soil, for creating
[SPEAKER_01]: your own nutrients, for buying expensive
and sexy nutrients at the hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to talk about the simple and
cheap one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are some of the suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, the path of least resistance,
you can simply go to one of the island
[SPEAKER_01]: shops and pick up bags of soil and put it
in the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually recommend that for indoor
because so often the bags of soil here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the island, when you open them,
they're going to have bugs in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can ruin an indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got a lot more room for error
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you grow indoors,
you have got an artificial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do everything that nature
would normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoors, if you use soil with bugs,
there are predators for those bugs also in
[SPEAKER_01]: your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every time I've ever used,
I use insect soil outdoors, I swear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year, the natural world just
cleans them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just use simple potting soil from
the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, do your plant a favor and
grab some compost out of your compost bin
[SPEAKER_01]: or ask your neighbor for some compost out
of their bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mix it in with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, potting soil is as close
to inner as you can get without putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the oven first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is to create an environment
where the soil is as alive as you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be so that it's a constant buffet of
nutrients for your plant to pull from as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get some potting soil, throw some
compost in it, call it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second version, you want to do a little
bit of upgrading.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still do the plain bags of soil,
but also throw in some store bought
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can Google cannabis fertilizers
and learn how to spend a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of those fertilizers are worth
the effort and the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is the simplest thing
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another possibility is mixing with
your bag of soil just for the first half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be from when you grow it to
when the daylight changes, which we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit more in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use simple fertilizer for growing
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a food garden in your house,
like most of us do on the island,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably already have vegetable
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so following the direct directions on
it, mix that in with your soil for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first part of the vegetative state where
your plant is just trying to get as large
[SPEAKER_01]: as it can before it starts to make
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professional growers will talk so much
trash about using just regular vegetable
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you can get sophisticated,
but you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: After August 15, the days will become 12
hours of light and 12 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what causes the cannabis plant to
start creating flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now your vegetable nutrients are
still going to be decent, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: really what you're going to be looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to spend some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switch on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The True Value, now ACE, has got a
fantastic selection of nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: for bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are looking for bloom mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says bloom on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to be good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always encourage folks to please
lean towards the organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I say this to you is
twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, a lot of the nutrients
that use petrochemicals or some other
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic chemicals that you can use in
your food garden, they are used to being
[SPEAKER_01]: in the food garden, having rain on them,
getting washed off, and then eaten in
[SPEAKER_01]: small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the plant picking up the nutrients,
putting them in the flowers, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially burning them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the chemicals that are OK for our
food crops have never been tested for
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have a plan to make oil or
edibles out of yours, if that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine you prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of us are just the revolving
toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these chemicals have never
been tested under a light bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second is, just like all chemical
fertilizers, there's going to be runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you saw the red tide we had around
the island last year, red tide happens
[SPEAKER_01]: when the fertilizers and the nutrients
from the island run off into the drains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they hang out around the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly we've got this big algae
bloom, which takes all of our filtered
[SPEAKER_01]: weeders and our clams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't eat any of that stuff because
of the red tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just generally lame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if at all possible, I encourage you to
go towards things that are marked organic
[SPEAKER_01]: or have got natural sources, both for your
health and the health of the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis really does not like to have
her feet wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a really good idea to put
something in your soil mixture that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow it to drain really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done a couple different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks like to mix perlite or coconut
flour, C-O-I-R, into their soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which allows the soil to hold the water it
needs, but not longer than it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mentor puts a bunch of pebbles,
about an inch and a half of pebbles,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bottom so that if there's any
overwatering, it will collect down there
[SPEAKER_01]: and go out of the soil so that the little
holes on the bottom of your pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes it easier and they don't get all
clogged up and the water just runs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be something,
again, if you want to have the expenditure
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you have pebbles on your property,
that's another good way to go to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: more room for error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what we're doing here as
beginner growers, is we want to create as
[SPEAKER_01]: much room for error as possible because
there will be error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will learn from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next summer, you will have an
even more successful crop because you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have all this new knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to upgrade from bagged soil,
I want to tell you about living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we won't dwell on this too much,
but I'm a big fan of it if you can afford
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our sponsors is Ion Organic Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out of Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have another sponsor,
Keep It Simple Organics out of Redmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both make soils that are
microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're biologically alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ion Organics even says with their soil
that all you have to do is add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already so living that throughout the
entire life process of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to add any nutrients at all
because the soil itself is alive and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological processes are off-putting
everything that your plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is absolutely the way of the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also reasonably priced because
then you aren't buying any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it much more full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to look into that,
it's usually about three times the price
[SPEAKER_01]: of just regular potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to do it on the cheap,
it might not be the option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got a little bit of room to
work with, I encourage you to reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: either Ion Organic Soil or somebody else
after you Google living soils and go for
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used Ion Soils for the first time myself
last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen my plants be that good
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is lighter, which makes the pots
easier to carry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so nutrient rich that it's like
this buffet for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That any time it wants, I think I want
some phosphorus or whatever, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: bam, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's definitely a step up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But know it exists if you want it,
if you want to go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last two things are, so my day job
is doing brand strategy for
[SPEAKER_01]: non-entrepreneur.com and also hosting
their podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had two podcasts recently that
if you really want to get into your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest that you listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both with Tad Husky,
who is the founder, actually the son of
[SPEAKER_01]: the founder of Keep It Simple Organics in
Redmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find either of these by going
to the entrepreneur.com in the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's in iTunes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can subscribe in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the two shows specifically that you'll
get a lot of use out of are the first one,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is on wild crafted nutrient teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this means is Tad explains how
you can go around the island and identify
[SPEAKER_01]: certain plants like, for example,
comfrey, which may be taking over your
[SPEAKER_01]: yard anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pick these plants, and you put
them in a five gallon bucket, and you sow
[SPEAKER_01]: them for a week to 10 days, preferably
with a little bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even that's not absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after those days, you take a ladle
out, and you pour that into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes through a whole series of
plants that will give you silica or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever comfrey gives you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're saving everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he goes through a list of six or seven
of the different nutrients that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find naturally in your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by wild crafting them, which just
simply means picking them out in the wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can create for yourself ultra natural
solutions without having to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: store and buy bottled nutrients,
which can be expensive, but are super
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first one, is nutrient wild
crafted teas with Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is also with Tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the second of a three part
series that we're doing with him on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all about building your own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Tad will explain most of these
inputs you need to pick up somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But between crushed shells and other
components of building a soil that may or
[SPEAKER_01]: may not necessarily be living by the ion
organic standards, but is a damn good
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will have taken this essentially
inert potting soil and super packed it
[SPEAKER_01]: with nutrients that your plant is going to
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really fun to build soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really gets you a feeling like
a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put down a tarp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw the soil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw the nutrients on top in a
similar recipe that's on the entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just Google marijuana soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a bunch of them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, if you just want to Google
it, the one that we recommend on the show
[SPEAKER_01]: is by this guy named Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is a brilliant dude who understands
soil biology fantastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clackamas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Clackamas, Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: C-O-O-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just looking him up and seeing
what he has to say on growing boards and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a good way to lose an
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal through the presentation
tonight is to give you the basics for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and to open the doors for you in
case you want to get obsessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll learn enough tonight to grow
something this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you decide that you have a passion
for it, or if you already know you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate grower, this may be something
that you enjoy doing for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that cannabis is the gateway to
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might get addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you understand where in your yard
you're going to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand that you're going to have
to deal with rain and fog and general
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture come the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got to figure out a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're not going to talk about
tonight is particular strain or cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got names like granddaddy purple,
mandarina, Dutch tree, sweet baby Jane.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these are key words that tell you a
little bit something about the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, where they're from.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a gross overgeneralization,
essentially you've got indicas,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are going to help you relax and help
you with pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got sativas, which are going to be
motivating and mentally focusing and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping you with depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got high CBD, which you're
going to have lots of CBD and no THC or
[SPEAKER_01]: little THC or lots of CBD and some THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal here is not to help you choose
the strains, but to let you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to figure out what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to make a decision about
whether or not you want a clone or to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is, without a doubt,
a preference to grow from clone if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: a beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of great reasons to grow
from seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will recommend seeds if you are this
kind of a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clones are made from a mother plant
that's already grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower that you buy it or your friend
who you barter with it or gives it to you
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, they will take a snipping off
their plant, put it in some rock wool,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it under lights, let it root,
and then it ends up looking like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a really easy, nearly
foolproof way to start putting the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones have got the age, though,
of the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the mother has been cared for by
your grower friend for a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: six months, a year and a half,
whatever, your clone is that age as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes maybe it doesn't have the
same gumption as a younger plant from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: will have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in food gardening
already, if you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: become a horticulture nerd as well,
you may want to consider seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the story on seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds are always going to be more robust
and have more moxie than a clone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge, anyway, it's not really a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge with seeds, though,
is number one, you need to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: germination process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not hard to germinate or pop
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find tons of videos on how to
do this on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually some version of put it in a
wet paper towel until you start to see
[SPEAKER_01]: plant come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to put it in a cup of
water for a few days and soak them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put them in a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a certain amount of risk,
because once the seedling starts to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out, it's really easy to dry them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some initial challenges in
that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably more importantly, though,
is when you're growing from seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know if they're going to be male
or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when growing cannabis, we've really
only want to grow the females to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Males are useful for pollen if you want to
create your own crosses or create your own
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Vivia organization, we keep a
library of males every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we usually have between 12 and 20
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kept at a Vivia member's house
that is not growing females that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they are full pollen,
we shake them into little bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who have donated or said
that they're going to make seeds this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, we give them a bag or a little jar
of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they take a paintbrush,
and you can paint it onto the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll cause seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, males are not what
you're going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going for the females where the THC
is that you want for your relief or the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to get educated on
how to delineate the males from the
[SPEAKER_01]: females, which is super easy with 10 years
of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, Google is really helpful in this
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good cameras are everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people who are posting
pictures and videos about how to sex your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some time and some effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to go that extra step,
popping your own seeds can be a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant that comes from them is going to
be more robust generally than clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though clones are plenty robust,
you'll get a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're the kind of person who likes
to jump in with two feet, you may really
[SPEAKER_01]: decide that you want to go with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, for those of you who live on Mashon,
we have got some fantastic seed makers
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the island, including,
if you already know in your head that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to go with seeds
because the jumping with both feet is
[SPEAKER_01]: describing you already, we've got our top
seed producer in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Michael, raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in seeds,
I asked Michael to bring seeds with him
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to talk with him,
he'll be able to tell you what he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: available right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you don't get seeds tonight and
you decide you want to, even though it's
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal, you can do mail order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you have medical
authorization, they're now selling them at
[SPEAKER_01]: many medical dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you live on Mashon also,
just ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's seeds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing through seed,
how long does the plant need to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: before you can sex it?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be sexed until just about the
time it starts to bloom because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's starting to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to start growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you're going to do indoor,
but for most of us who are outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clock flips over in and around August
15.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the cultivar part,
some of them start a little earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them start a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moral of the story is you won't
know until mid-end of August, generally
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're putting time and resources
and maybe repotting them up if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a few just to decide that you're going to
either snip them and throw them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: compost or call me and add them to the
pollen library for Vivian if you happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: live on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sex the seeds though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can pay to have seeds sexed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't do it yourself like my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am aware of no way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's new technologies from Steep Hill
Labs in California where they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the kind of price point that we're
talking about here tonight, I would not
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that a realistic option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, another option is for seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also where I'm going to
suggest that you could go for clones is if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a medical authorization,
you can go to the PCE, the Patient
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in Tacoma on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the most wonderful
experiences that you will have as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis patient to go there and check out
this family environment of like 50
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis producers, all sorts of flower
and edibles and seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Willy Wonka for cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to have a medical
authorization to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the first place that I would
recommend that you go if you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization and if you want to work from
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clones Northwest has got a booth there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have fantastic clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very reasonably priced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a rotating list of strains
every Sunday and 99% of the time they're
[SPEAKER_01]: in great shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not in good shape,
sometimes we'll just give them to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cannot recommend going to the Patient
Cannabis Exchange enough if you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have an authorization,
this is where you need to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more creative by talking to your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're here, if you're interested in
cannabis, you probably already know
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are, let them know that you'd
like to have a clone from them in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives them enough time to make
you a clone, get it rooted, so that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about when to go outside
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, it's Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody were to start a clone for
you now, it would be in great shape by
[SPEAKER_01]: that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another opportunity is that the last Vimia
meeting before the laws change here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington is going to be June 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, that's a really awesome
meeting to be at because the fellow I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking about, Tad Hussey,
who did the podcast with me on building
[SPEAKER_01]: your own soil and wild crafting your own
nutrient teas, he's going to be here
[SPEAKER_01]: talking live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually really excited about that
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a fantastic national reputation
for all natural organic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also invited two clone
providers to join us as well to provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe come back to the June 15 meeting
as well, and you may be able to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone at that time as well here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: You generally don't want your clone in the
ground on Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the important aspect is that we need to
have nighttime temperatures above 50 every
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the weather stays like this,
people will start going into the ground or
[SPEAKER_01]: going outside, as we say, earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge, though, is that our
Northwest weather is really fickle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we have got a week like we have
had, where evenings are 46, and today was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what, 82 or something ridiculous,
growers on the island are already starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that cut in, that itch,
where they're really being tempted to go
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all it takes is 10 days from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have four days in a row of low 40s
rain with morning fog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll have wasted your efforts,
because there's a really good chance that
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant won't make it through that
unless you do something extra,
[SPEAKER_01]: like build a cloche or something like
that, or some kind of a hold frame to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them warm at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy yourself a little more
wiggle room with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rule of thumb is that you want
your evenings to stay above 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, by Mother's Day,
you're in pretty good shape for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I want to focus in on
the seeds versus clones and choosing your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is sometimes you just have to grow
what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your friend is growing three strains,
and they're the ones who is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you your clones, you just need to
take what they've got, and you'll just go
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to order seeds,
or if you're going to go to the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis exchange, or if you're going to
have some choice, I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose something that has got as short of
a flowering cycle as you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicas, generally, will have a flowering
cycle of around eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get into sativas, which are more
tropical, you're talking about 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them, like never.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I had a lot of luck last summer
with a strain called shishka berry,
[SPEAKER_01]: which claims to be finished in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was done for me in six and a half
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of where we live,
if we lived farther south, we would be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow more sativas and be able to
finish without all the covering as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you continually have to go farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: farther south to be growing sativas
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why Bashan has got the 30 year
reputation of growing some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: indica in the country, because that's all
we do is indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the seeds that are produced
on the island, year over year,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are picking their best plants and
just seeding the flowers on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so year over year, the seeds get
better and better and better, just for
[SPEAKER_01]: where we live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those same seeds are not going to be as
good if you take them down to Sonoma
[SPEAKER_01]: County, because the weather is different
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you buy seeds on Bashan that were
produced on Bashan, you're going to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: a much better situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, try to get the shortest
flowering time as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: When to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've already hit most of this already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to go outside at Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're feeling confident,
when you see the evenings staying above
[SPEAKER_01]: 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely have put him out when the
evenings were 47, 48, and hoped for the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some years, I got the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some years, I had to go get new
clothes and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have got different risk tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we're looking for,
our 50 degree evenings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people also like to start them
indoors under a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is not something you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it, if there's two
stages for the plant, if there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation stage, which is the plant
trying to get as big as it can before it
[SPEAKER_01]: changes its priorities to making flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your plant outside at Mother's
Day, you've got between then and around
[SPEAKER_01]: August 15 for the vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the energy is put into the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to start now, like many
professional growers are, you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant under lights and get it growing
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you put it out when the
evening temperatures are 50 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's already this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you are rewarded for your effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your efforts look like either
repurposing or buying a grow lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we have had a whole other
evenings on lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not talking about indoor growing
specifically here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can really do a lot of good with
just buying a decent plant grow light in
[SPEAKER_01]: the natural light spectrum from the
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you screw it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a couple of starts under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start them early enough and they
get too big, maybe you decide you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal here is that you just want
the plant to have an opportunity to get
[SPEAKER_01]: its start before you put it outside if
you're going to go this route.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of discussion about how long
to have the light on while it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But suffice to say that if you have your
light on for 18 hours and off for six
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, you're in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people who will suggest 24
hours of light to get all the growing you
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some amazing plants from 24
hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think it's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's really smart to give the
plant an opportunity to rest a few hours
[SPEAKER_01]: every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just putting it on a timer for 18 hours
on, six hours off, and doing that until
[SPEAKER_01]: you're ready to go outside, you can have
your plant get a big jump on nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, you may increase the size of
your plant by a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may increase your volume of
flowers by as much as a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got the $20, $30 to throw,
at just some simple plant lights at the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store, your efforts will be
rewarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal with watering is to water the pot
evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in this case, I should say
the soil evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also want the soil to have the
opportunity to nearly dry out between
[SPEAKER_01]: waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how it is in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't like its feet wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a very prevalent philosophy
that it's good to let your plant work a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little bit of stress so that it
feels like it has to earn its keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the great way to water is water it
enough that everything gets wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not enough that it's going to stay
soaked necessarily for the rest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule of thumb that my mentor has
taught me has worked out well for me is
[SPEAKER_01]: just plan on getting it a good solid
watering once a day outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the weather is hot like it is
today, plan on watering it twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's gray and kind of foggy or
raining, skip a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's raining for three days in a
row, maybe just give it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of growing good cannabis is
developing a relationship with the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can listen to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She will tell you what she needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she's starting to wilt, chances are
you're not giving her quite enough water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other things it can be
too, but just generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the leaves are starting to turn yellow,
chances are you're giving her too much
[SPEAKER_01]: water, just like the rest of your
houseplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you really want to dive into
this, you can Google watering cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and learn far more than we have the
time to offer you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rule of thumb that will get you to
a good harvest is just plan on giving it a
[SPEAKER_01]: good soaking once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the excess drain out the bottom of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's hot, water more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's our typical foggy,
rainy, weak, waterless.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in doubt, don't water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And come back in 12 hours and check it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't hurt to have the soil
dry out some.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, the soil will dry out
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's genetics are used to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you don't want is the kind of dry
where the soil detaches from the pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can start to see lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get the kind of tumbleweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at that point, you're going to
start drying up your root system,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to start causing damage
that may be irreparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
Blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the cultivar that you end
up with, the blooming will start somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: around August 15th, because nature goes to
12 hours of day life, 12 hours of day
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be at this point, if you are
choosing to purchase bloom nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to start adding this
probably to your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the blooming nutrients are called
to put them on the soil, and put a little
[SPEAKER_01]: soil on top, and then water that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them are added to water as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to add bloom nutrients,
now is the time to start that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also when your plant is going
to start to stank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people don't like the smell of
cannabis, and for them, my heart goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the smell of a really stinky
cannabis plant, the same way that I love
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell of a really stinky cheese that
smells like baby diaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smell, though, as the plant blooms,
is going to get more and more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this brings us back around to the
conversation about your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're talking about your growing
for your personal use, we're probably only
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about a few plants here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're talking about a patient
legally in Washington, we're only talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about four, unless you're under registry,
then you're up to six or 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're doing well,
and if your plant is having some success,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you've got a smelly strain,
say, for example, skull, you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: aware that your plants are going to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so consider that when you're choosing
the part of your yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also consider that because it's going
to be really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is my personal favorite part,
even more than harvesting, because
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting means I'm going to have to
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plants start to smell and give
off their unique terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is nature's aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an aroma therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will feel joy in your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will know you're having success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a certain connection with
nature when you start to smell that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just don't get anywhere else than
from smelling flowers, which is why we
[SPEAKER_01]: give them in romance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once blooming starts, you will notice
that the size of the plant will slow down
[SPEAKER_01]: in its increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will start to see either sex,
if you're coming from seeds, or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from a clone, we should be darn
well guaranteed that it's a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you will start to see the blooms
start at the nodules where the branches
[SPEAKER_01]: are meeting the main stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right nestled in here, you'll start to
see flowers all the way down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the beginning, all they are are
these little, tiny, usual white hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the promise of future
awesomeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will happen around August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is when, if you know what your
strainer cultivar is, I recommend that you
[SPEAKER_01]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say for example, it's Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and Google Blue Dream strain
flowering time, and find out what the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time is for the plant that
you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll tell you how many days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it'll just tell you round it out
to weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from August 15th, put on your calendar
forward that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will give you an approximation of
when your plant is going to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about harvesting more in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that will give you a general idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I suggest you put it on
your calendar is, number one, it will help
[SPEAKER_01]: you be patient during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will help you resist harvesting
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when the plant starts smelling
potent, and when you see it, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather report starts getting worse,
you're going to be tempted to harvest it
[SPEAKER_01]: early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the THC sets in the plant just in
the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD in the plant, it sets in about two
to three weeks earlier than the THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for commercial growers, we're growing
indoors, you can actually cut off crop
[SPEAKER_01]: early if you're just going for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of a year,
you can work in, actually, an extra crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to be able to let it go
its entire length.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you decide when to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way I know is to spend a week
bucks on eBay and pick up a 30X jeweler's
[SPEAKER_01]: loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use a 30X magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll find on the flowers are these
little stalks that are called tricones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside the tricones is the cannabis oil,
which is the goal of all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got your little loop,
you get on in there, and for the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: first part of the blooming cycle,
you will see these stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll be, first they'll just be
small and clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll get taller and clearer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll be taller with a kind of
a bulb on the top and be clearer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll start to get a little
cloudier, milky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you just want to start
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will start to turn amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of different opinions on,
once it turns amber, what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will say the whole plant should be
amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will say as soon as it starts getting
amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to pull a tweener.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a judgment call.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when some of the tricones are amber,
I go ahead and harvest at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not all be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on Vashon, where we are fighting the
weather, if a good group of your tricones
[SPEAKER_01]: are amber and the rest are cloudy and
about to become amber, you should just cut
[SPEAKER_01]: and run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have got CBD that's sitting in
the plant ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your THC that's sitting in the
plant and is ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's time to just go ahead and cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without magnification, it's very
challenging to decide when to harvest the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really don't want to spend the
eight bucks or ask your friend to borrow
[SPEAKER_01]: their magnifying glass, you can just
harvest based on the recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: blindly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to leave some
tricones on the table though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend that if you're going to go
through this and put all of your time and
[SPEAKER_01]: effort and love into this plant,
then you go ahead and pick up an eight
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar with free shipping jeweler's loop
on eBay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, once you have it, you'll be
surprised how many other cool things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool to have around the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing to look at bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're talking about
looking at them for their THC content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the amber means that the THC is going
to be higher?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're just looking to harvest for
more CBD, will the tricones be an
[SPEAKER_04]: indicator of that health?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a sticky wicket here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a strain and you're not
growing for THC at all, let's say that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing for seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want some THC in there to take
advantage of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant medicine aspect of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can harvest a week to two earlier than
recommended, and there will absolutely be
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD material stored in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a dangerous game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is usually something that I would
only recommend for professionals who are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with their strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, if you're about to leave on
vacation, or if the weather is just about
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to hell, and you're only looking
really for the CBD, yeah, a case could be
[SPEAKER_01]: made to harvest a week or two early and
neglect a lot of the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, though, even if you're
going to get a CBD plant, you do want some
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of THC in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to end up with it not
matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would still go to let the tricones
become amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got more room to cut early if
you're just going for the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, as far as the general rule,
it's going to be when some of the tricones
[SPEAKER_01]: are matured, fully amber, cut and pull
inside, especially if it's going to rain
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for many, this is bittersweet,
because you had this relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant all summer, and now it's time
to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people have got different ways they
like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks like to go starting at the
bottom and cutting up the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: just cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Branch, branch, branch, branch,
and just kind of set up a side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from Alex, from Solstice,
who spoke last fall here on harvesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing, Alex Cooley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that his team always harvests from
the bottom in case there's any mold on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, which we'll talk about a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll cut, and the mold falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes higher to cut,
and the mold falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, if you start at the top and you
cut, if there's any mold up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it drops down on the lower plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time you're at the bottom,
any mold that's above has come down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always start at your bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way to do it, and a lot of folks
do this if they don't have a lot of room
[SPEAKER_01]: to hang their plant, which we'll discuss
in a minute, is just take some big cutters
[SPEAKER_01]: and cut the stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been really successful,
you may not be able to cut it just with
[SPEAKER_01]: pruners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need a hacksaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way or another, you need to cut it and
hang it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got at least two options at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this wire here is perfect for
hanging cannabis from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wired, so it's not going to have much
bend to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend you hanging on string,
because string, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So hanging on wire, or cable, or a
typewriter, or a taut filament is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends who's on the island
who's a retired professor, he doesn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting all of his individual branches,
because it fills up too much space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what he does is he's got a cable that's
already run in his garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just cuts the whole plant, and he hangs
the whole plant all in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every summer, he just does five
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got one, two, three, four,
five, done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all hung at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he trims off that, which we'll
talk about in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to harvest, did you stop fertilizing
the plant a couple weeks before?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be on the instructions of
your bloom fertilizer about how many weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, since we're going to be
consuming it, folks recommend that you
[SPEAKER_01]: stop fertilizing at least two weeks
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you do what's
called a flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're just watering it to flush
out the nutrients in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that it gives you an even taste,
and you don't waste nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't going to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the room that you're hanging in,
this is probably going to be a punt for
[SPEAKER_01]: most everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some differentiation about
humidity in a drying room.
[SPEAKER_01]: 62% humidity is often what's gone for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's less humid, your plant will dry
faster, and the taste will develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: little less.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's more humid, it may never dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, since the most important
aspects are cool and dark, you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: have a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might just put it in your cool,
dark place you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even if it dries quickly,
it's not like it's going to be ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be troublesome if your goal was
to sell it, and people have got really
[SPEAKER_01]: high standards for flower now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since we're talking about growing for
yourself, if you just hang it in a room
[SPEAKER_01]: that is dark and cool, you're probably
going to be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to get nerdy about it,
go ahead and Google drying cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll get an exhaustive conversation
on different techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for this, what we want you to do is
just hang it to the point that the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches, when you bend them, they snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bend them and they bend,
it's not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bend it and it snaps, you're good
to go to the next stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about, I know it's
probably sacrilegious, but I have a whole
problem with agulant, and I put it in a
dehydrator.
And you dry it and you're going to sell
it, it really saves.
It seemed like it was OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a rough thing on the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other other than maybe it's
an age problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: A dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I have absolutely heard of folks
dehydrating with the heat off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're dehydrating with just the air
blowing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, that's not going to be efficient
enough, though, because most dehydrators
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you only have a couple plants and
you've got a big dehydrator, I don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: any reason why you couldn't go in that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, last year, I built insulating
rigging insulation and built a 4 by 4 box
[SPEAKER_01]: and put a dehydrator inside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's the kind of mad science that
works all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can chop it, hang it in your garage,
come back in two weeks after checking on
[SPEAKER_01]: it every day, and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can do this kind of mad science and
have it dry at a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it dries at a slower rate,
the tastes come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't know the botany of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the tastes are able to develop and
mature in a way that doesn't happen when
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets dry really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to know why that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about the plant mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about the trichomes or any of the
turkeys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the vegetative plant mature
in a way that they cure tobacco in a slow
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that if you dry that plant mature
very quickly, it'll burn quickly and it'll
[SPEAKER_04]: be harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you cure it in that slow way and
you remove the most moisture slowly,
[SPEAKER_04]: the vegetative part of the plant will burn
more slowly and it'll be a smoother burn
[SPEAKER_04]: and it preserves the moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more tastes, less cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a conversion of starches into
sugars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of that process of the
plant still thinking it's alive in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first few days after it's been cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually still thinks it's alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it eats itself of its starches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those starches get combined with the
sugars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those sugars actually gives it better
marijuana, better flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you use a dehydrator or something like
that, sometimes you can pull some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: sugars out too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Joshua.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said when I started,
the room is filled with growers who know
[SPEAKER_01]: more than I do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh being one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as you want to get into this,
growing unfolds itself and you can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: more, which I continue to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, are they talking about
dehumidifiers?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like a dehydrator to make beef jerky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a food dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a food dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small box and it's got shelves that
pull it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and a heat source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're going to use recanidus
though, most everybody detaches the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: source because you don't want the heat
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you put a dehumidifier in your
garage or shower?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably take the humidity too
low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I do like you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, well, if you've got really
high humidity and you might need a
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier to bring it down some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just be careful because in my
experience with dehumidifiers,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we'll use them in the grow room so
that the grow room doesn't get like
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't get too moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're kind of playing with fire doing
that in your curing closet because if your
[SPEAKER_01]: humidifiers aren't too long, it'll pull
all the moisture out of the air and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll get really rigid really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any experience about the
books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would avoid books in my curing closet
just because of potential mold risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a level approximately around,
like humidity level in a drying room where
[SPEAKER_00]: you do need to start worrying about
facilitating mold growth and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a percentage, like how much over 62%
humidity in that dry curing room could
[SPEAKER_00]: start contributing to too much moisture
and mold or whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is I don't have a good
answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer answer though is that even at
62 degrees, or excuse me, 62%,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are still going to be dealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's mold on the plant that you're
bringing in, it's going to continue being
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plant is molded, it should be
thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see mold on your plant,
don't bring that mold into your drying
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it off and leave it outside somewhere
because you don't want to bring those
[SPEAKER_01]: spores into the drying room where it could
contaminate the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mold is a vein of growing in the
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are two primary kinds of mold
that we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first and most common is powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew looks like white splotches
on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes grown men cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Google online for powdery mildew
sprays and people will give you all sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of amazing concoctions that they think
works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make a long story short though,
the choice for many is either you rub it
[SPEAKER_01]: off with your hands and then you rub your
hands on a disinfectant and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to rub it down the plant where
you see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a lot of people just, once there's
powdery mildew on the leaf, it becomes as
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was a contagion and they just remove
the leaf from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a serious powdery mildew
problem though, you could be taking a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are definitely two different
schools of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that it's not a big deal to take
leaves off the plant, especially in bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: because why bother to keep that leaf
alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people think that every time
you take a leaf, you are causing stress to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a huge powdery mildew
problem and you've got a lot of leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a strong case to be made
to just remove the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant is being taken over by
powdery mildew, at that point you're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to want to look into
spraying it and just trying to do whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you can to save the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second kind of mildew or the second
type of mold that we have that's a real
[SPEAKER_01]: drag is called Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Botrytis manifests in two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is it will be at the crown of
the flower, right at the very top,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can start to see it get gray and
fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a drag, but at least you see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way is it will be in the very
core of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll grow this beautiful flower and
be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you break it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't smoke it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible for a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it's even worse where we live is
because while we try to keep Botrytis out
[SPEAKER_01]: of our crops, they spray Botrytis in
Oregon for their late-bottled vintage
[SPEAKER_01]: Rieslings and ice wines because it causes
them to mature in taste and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what blows up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have got a really serious Botrytis
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should expect to lose a percentage
of your crop to mold just because of where
[SPEAKER_01]: we live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, let's rewind it back to the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to figure out what kind of
soil you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pick the area in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are going to get your hands on
either seeds or a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to plant it all up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go through your vegetation
period, which is going to allow your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow up large.
[SPEAKER_01]: August 15 is going to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start seeing flowers come
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to reach the point that some
of the trichomes are starting to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: amber or are amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hang it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to let it dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's dry, there's a preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either trim the flowers down of
their small leaves, sugar leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll call it, to make them pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're wet, some people like to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you drop it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people like to wait until it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough time to go into that
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suffice to say, though, that once it is
dry enough in the curing process that the
[SPEAKER_01]: branch snaps, it should go into glass
jars, like a mason jar, for about two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And open it once a day and let the air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you're doing is the drying
that you are done in your room to the
[SPEAKER_01]: snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main part of the drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you bring it into glass jars,
you are now slowing down that process to
[SPEAKER_01]: its end so that the last of the starches
convert to sugars and you get a finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product that is very pleasant to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different strategies
for how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really isn't a way to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you're putting your flowers in
the jar, you've already won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about differentiation of
taste at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time, over talking with other
growers, if you want to do some more
[SPEAKER_01]: research online, you will get more
sophisticated in how you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a beginner's course, if you get
through this whole process, and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: hung it, and you get them into jars,
and you're opening the jars once a day for
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks, what you have there is a huge
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that and you can smoke it for
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make tinctures if you prefer not
to smoke and use that on a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn it into oil and use it in
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have won.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already won at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from that point on, the next year,
you're just going to be fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, that is what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 10 minutes for questions
if you have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because, like I already said,
I'm not the best grower in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just the one doing the beginner's
coursework, we might share some answers,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, from the more professional folks in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who has a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you pruning these plants while you're
growing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just letting them go?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some difference of opinion
about whether or not you're going to prune
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not going to prune
branches because they've got flowers on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well into the bloom cycle, some people
will like the idea of taking off some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the extra branches that either don't have
flowers or have got emaciated flowers so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant can continue to put its
energy into the robust flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that that stresses out
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's certainly a debatable issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do prune to get off the fluff,
and I move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, I don't really think there's a
right answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about hours of sunshine when you're
trying to decide where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: place your pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: All you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really, the more sunshine that
your plant gets during the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more it can do photosynthesis and take
care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have got a place in your property
that's going to be shaded most of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's definitely not where you want to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a southwest facing side of
your house, that would be a really great
[SPEAKER_01]: place because not only do you get all the
day sunshine, but you get all the
[SPEAKER_01]: reflected sunshine off the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, at the end of day, when you're
getting that awesome end of day bash on
[SPEAKER_01]: light, the house will still be warm,
which will keep the ambient temperature up
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, your goal is to be in as much
sun every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say I've got some other plants that I like
the strains, and they're doing really
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live off maybe a year, like you were
saying, or a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it like converting them to seed
producers at the end of that cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they still strong enough to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either put them in a room or put
them next to a guy, or you can get pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the Vimeo pollen library,
and then paint them on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is not my specialty,
I don't think that people put their
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers to seed all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you with that, Jake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: When a plant is going to seed,
is the flower useless for smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, some of the coolest
gifts I've been given by professional
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is a little paper envelope with a
seeded flower in it, because it gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: a sample of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just simply use your thumbs and get
the seeds out, and then you smoke what's
[SPEAKER_01]: left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, people will complain about
seeds because you don't want to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The energy from the plant will be taken
from flower production into seed
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be quite the burly THC
as you would get if the plant wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your goal is to produce seeds for
the next year, go ahead, seed the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out the seeds, and then just ... It's
not going to be great anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it makes a great joint.
You said that with a doctor's farm,
you can do 15 plants.
Is that per parcel or per patient?
Per parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analyze parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on the King County parcel viewer,
one number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would give you 100 acres where it
could be a quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you run your parcels together
into one parcel?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other great area is there's still
hashing this out, but there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: room for patient collectives for a couple
people to get together, but there seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: be issues with the rules between letting a
couple people get together to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: together versus how many plants on a
parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to deconstruct the law
here tonight, but we're still hoping that
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislature cleans up some of the
rules during this session so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes less of a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it's so muddy right now,
nobody knows anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is incredibly muddy right now,
which is why I'm teaching this
[SPEAKER_01]: information, and it may be legal to grow
not being a patient, and it may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: legal to grow to a patient this summer,
but if you're a grower, you have to make
[SPEAKER_01]: these decisions here in the next few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the legislature is not really
concerned with our preferences,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've seen that they really don't care
about patients, so we've got to take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, they've had helicopters
flying over and taking pictures and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get a sense of what their aim is
coming up, or are they secretive about
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is that we don't know
what their plans are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer answer, though, is that at the
cannabis ethics meeting I was at two
[SPEAKER_01]: months ago, I was speaking to Senator Cole
Wells, and I asked her about Bachelor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said, you know, we have a trade
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 152 medical growers which are now
all having to make the choice for their
[SPEAKER_01]: families to either give up this extra
income or become criminals in the eyes of
[SPEAKER_01]: the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are these people that the state
encouraged to get involved in all the
[SPEAKER_01]: rural economic development we did,
what are they supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to send a King County
sheriff out here to start busting
[SPEAKER_01]: families?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get an answer, and what I
mostly got was shocked looks because
[SPEAKER_01]: people hadn't really considered all the
people who had intentionally built
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses across Washington that now have
got to make this terrible choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got 502 members in the
organization, and I support them and their
[SPEAKER_01]: right to try to make, you know,
some profit from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the medical folks were as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the medical growers' families have got
a decision to make right now that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all watching to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the DEA is not spending any more
money on cannabis interdiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're out of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our local King County sheriff seems to be,
you know, there's no problem if there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a couple plants at your
house, and there's no problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody's going to give you a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing a couple plants at
your house, and you're beating your wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have weapons, and they come to
your house and you're a jerk, they may use
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis to take you in because they
need to put together a case against you,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best advice I'm getting is be
polite, be private, don't grow too many
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, don't be too flamboyant,
don't sell it, and keep it away from kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do those things, regardless of what
the letter of the law is, probably no one
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to have enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly don't expect the huge
helicopters to be back like they were in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 90s, scaring the hell out of everybody
on the island, but we'll see what happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things could change in a really bad
direction if, depending on who's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Oval Office too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, so with that, we want to
get on to the door prizes, so thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
