[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one of the kind of hidden in
plain sight secrets of cannabis home
[SPEAKER_02]: growing is how many people water their
plants with chlorinated tap water from the
[SPEAKER_02]: city and don't want to cop to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we all pretty much know
that we should not be using the tap water
[SPEAKER_02]: because it usually has chlorine and
chloramines and fluoride and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are toxins to the microbe
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, having the water out
or spun to blow off the chlorine and even
[SPEAKER_02]: worse is the chloramines, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you can't blow off.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people just don't have time for
that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're just generally lazy about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they just go ahead and straight
with the tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we took it as a rule, clearly that
should not be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of folks are like, my plants
still grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose, you know, it still does all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, will you break out for
us how significant it is using tap water
[SPEAKER_02]: versus using something that is fresh
without the chemicals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it really matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I think it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we really tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad I have a well because it's
just you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that most people
don't think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just water their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works because, first of all,
if you let the water just sit for 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes or an hour, the chlorine will
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In either case, by putting the chlorine
and the chloramine, which you're right is
[SPEAKER_01]: much worse because it never evaporates
into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is the organics in the soil
complex it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tie it up so that it may kill
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gets tied up and then it's no
longer active, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you're able to water
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes are still alive, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you killing any microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you killing lots of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three or four ways you can find
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can test the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could send it in for a soil food web
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could see whether the soil
really is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, it's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just let the bucket of water sit and
go have a watering can and just let it sit
[SPEAKER_01]: or a barrel and use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's taking care of the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let the other stuff complex up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people put Tang in, which complexes
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the organic matter doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tang?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tang.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't mean the orange beverage from
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's like adding sugar and feeding
the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you look Google fish tanks and,
you know, chlorine, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, that's where the tank stuff
probably starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it started from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, so what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the water sit for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could use well water, that's a
better way to go, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainwater, you know, I used to suggest
just keep a barrel of rainwater around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but gee, it's all got glyphosate in it
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the idea of having the
water out because the chlorine,
[SPEAKER_02]: it vapes off pretty easily, but you're
still left with chloramine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say that when we pour the
chloramine water into the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some biology there that will bind
with the chloramine and make it,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just say inner, for lack of a better
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we add whatever that is to the water
and have that done before we pour it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of handfuls of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's sit there for an hour or two or
three and stir it every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in the mature compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: That binds with the chloramine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's organic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whatever, whatever you got
in there, particles of clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humic acids and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the things that the microbes eat,
oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it complexes it up and I'm sure the
microbes then take it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say people who really want to,
you know, take action on rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that you've got a, you know,
a typical water barrel and you've poured
[SPEAKER_02]: water from your city tap into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, what is that,
like a 55 gallon, you know, you say just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, throw a couple handfuls of
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, make a compost tea out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw, you know, throw in,
yeah, throw in for 55 gallon, I'd throw in
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three or four pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just run, bubble it or stir it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was making, because I am,
making aerated compost tea separately,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just pour it right in there and it
will clean up the chloramines.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the solution I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you're killing some of the
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're making the compost tea,
Oh, you'll be killing some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd rather have that happen in a
container than in my pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to keep the integrity of
the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, again, millions of people
water their plants with the chlorine and
[SPEAKER_01]: the chloramine in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you can do to reduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is definitely not hurting your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for everything that I've ever read,
it certainly could be helping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
Thank you.
