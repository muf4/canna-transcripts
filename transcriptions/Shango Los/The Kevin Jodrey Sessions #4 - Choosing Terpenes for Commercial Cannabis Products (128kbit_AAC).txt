[SPEAKER_01]: So this next question is a manufacturing
question because, you know, I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have hunted terpenes and done big sips
your whole life, and you know the value of
[SPEAKER_01]: a really good terpene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it comes to extraction,
you know, almost all of us lean towards
[SPEAKER_01]: really clean, whole plant cannabis
extractions to get our terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're making edibles and you want
to add some terpenes to that, the price
[SPEAKER_01]: point doesn't make sense to do cannabis
extracted all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got different levels of
terpene, both extraction processes and
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not they're cannabis sourced or
whether or not they're food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of folks get confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll just bash one or the
other without understanding that when you
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to design a product to bring it
to the mass market, it can't just be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to work on the spreadsheet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are helping your clients think
through what level and what source of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene to choose, you know, how do you
help them think through that challenge?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to that, that's just pure
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we start to say we're going
to go from whole plant, full extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: to where we're going to do crude,
distillate, added terps, it becomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the price point of the product
that's going to get sold downstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to go all the way backwards
through the chain to figure out what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to sell it for in order to be
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these questions before,
we're always done with, like, don't
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody talk about the dirty product we're
going to put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with testing, no matter what,
it has to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't have any issue with
plant-derived terps because fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, people that have little money
shouldn't be precluded from using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if all they can afford is bulk
cannabis that was cleanly extracted and
[SPEAKER_00]: then someone like Ben from True Terpene's
who does some really nice work,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's about it, he lays you out a floral
pattern that is rich and you consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go, well, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's way more affordable than
steam-distilled terps that you derived or
[SPEAKER_00]: you did closed loop and you pulled them
off and put them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not your price point,
that's not your price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your price point is that and that's
what you're selling, then that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the fight you hear so
much is because each individual believes
[SPEAKER_00]: that their system is what works best for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't diminish either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two radically different worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to understand why you're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the end goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the price that it's gonna sell
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at it like that,
it becomes a question you ask your
[SPEAKER_00]: accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sit down with your accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of terps can I afford?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I afford?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is my real margin on the sale?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it starts to become too low to be
profitable, you know that you can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an emotional response.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you would do for yourself
privately for your own stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely can't sell it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't see any issue with any of
the different formulations because really
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does, it allows you to deal with
the reality of income.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have people who make very little,
who are in pain and could use homeopathic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have psychological issues,
either depression or anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can use certain forms of cannabis
to either increase or decrease these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should they be precluded from
consuming when they can't afford the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest farm-grown product ever done?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supermarket has food for all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis has always historically
been for all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the advent of technology,
it allows you to be able to drop the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of production dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that doesn't mean that it changes
everyone's reality, but it allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover a large spectrum of the lower cost
portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go forward, there is a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: No derived package is as complete as the
natural package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know this as a consumer,
that I play with all of them, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care which one I play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that isn't pulled off directly from the
varietal, because the terps and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, this is a union.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to take something apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to deconstruct something and
then say, look, this is the important
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is it's a synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a homogenous mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant created all these things in some
form for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has it in its genealogical background
to produce these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they interrelate?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not smart enough to know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we start to think with that
smart, we already know we're going the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is too complex a molecular
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to just say, for whatever
reason, for reasons unknown, these things
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be best in this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the people who can discern that
and afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the education is present,
then people will know, look, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why we pay a higher price for this
because of the subtleties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people who don't have the money,
I don't see anything wrong with a crude
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been cleaned, and derived terps
that have been applied, just don't apply
[SPEAKER_00]: them so heavy you're creating a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My problem with adding terps back into
mixes is that they're going so heavy with
[SPEAKER_00]: the terps to create this unbelievably terp
experience that people forget that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent, especially limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're adding all this citrus into
your product to get this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpene, explosive, grabbing,
hungry, I want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know what it does to the
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to make sure that you're
really trying to keep it within some range
[SPEAKER_00]: and balance that's been here because we've
had so little medical damage done to
[SPEAKER_00]: people using, from cannabis use,
that I believe, and I talked to Ben the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing, we both believe that as they
start to turn these dials, we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in how people are affected by it,
both in cannabinoid levels, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: unusually high, and in terpenoid levels
that are unusually high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't really have any R&D on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the guinea pigs and we'll know as we
go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, as long as you turn those back
to realistic, so that you're not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make someone believe, hey, my manufactured
product that's accentuated is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the real product because the
numbers are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be, but they're radically
different in subtlety and experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and experience of the smoker will
determine it, and money will allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: make those fine choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the difference between a really
high-end whiskey and a low-end whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drink a bottle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna know you drink a bottle of
whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is absolutely alive in the
mouth, and the other one is a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can afford the qualities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be the same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you.
