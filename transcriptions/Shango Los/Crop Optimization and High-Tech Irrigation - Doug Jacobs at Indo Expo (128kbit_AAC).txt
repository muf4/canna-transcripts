[SPEAKER_02]: We welcome Doug Jacobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug is technical advisor for cannabis
customers at Growdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been growing cannabis since he was
13 and has been consulting professionally
[SPEAKER_02]: for commercial horticulture since he's
been in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has depth in both cannabis as well as
ornamental and other commercial growing
[SPEAKER_02]: operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today he'll be speaking about technology
assisted crop optimization and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please put it together for Doug.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Doug Jacobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the technical advisor for Growdown
and today we are going to talk about what
[SPEAKER_01]: is precision growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the important things you need to
measure as growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is plant steering?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how to create an irrigation strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first things first, what is precision
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put, precision growing is growing
more with less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less water, less nutrients, less labor,
with the goal of increasing yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: potency, labor, reducing the use of labor,
water, nutrients, and increasing your
[SPEAKER_01]: profitability, but also becoming more
sustainable as growers, reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of runoff we put into the
environment and reducing the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural resources we consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Precision growing is an integrated
approach that takes into account the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic that you're growing, the climate
that you have, and root zone management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And root zone management is basically
influencing the root zone of the crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to steer it in a certain direction
to optimize growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as growers, what can we control?
[SPEAKER_01]: We control our canopy environment,
the temperature, leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, CO2, light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the root zone we can select substrate
and that's substrate determines the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of nutrients, the air to
water ratio, the electrical connectivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what nutrients we apply, the quality of
them, and how they are available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first things first, what do we need to
measure as growers in order to optimize
[SPEAKER_01]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously climate conditions are
important, but it's not just the minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: or maximum of the day, it's the actual
trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing how the climate reacts to lights
coming on, the plants uptaking and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiring, and so it's important to
select a system that allows you to see
[SPEAKER_01]: these trends over the course of the day so
you can avoid any spikes that happen when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're transitioning from night to day or
day to night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the root zone, it's important to
know the amount of runoff your substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: is putting off, but also what is the water
content the EC and the temperature of your
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crop registration is probably the most
underutilized tool in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring plant height is really an
important measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my plant developing on time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I creating the right structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something preventing it from
growing the same way it was growing the
[SPEAKER_01]: last time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at leaf color allows you to see,
is my plant in balance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it getting enough nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a disease affecting it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stem color, again, it tells you,
is the plant in stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it supposed to be purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it under stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a bug attacking it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stem diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stem diameter can be used to track the
rate of growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, if you can compare it to
previous crops, you can catch a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: before it really affects the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower development, measuring diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower initiation, when it first puts
flowers out, how those flowers develop
[SPEAKER_01]: over the cycle can really tell you,
well, am I doing something wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really, really is helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants during one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you're able to control your
climate and irrigation, you have baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements to compare from previous
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start using irrigation and climate
as a tool to steer plant growth in the
[SPEAKER_01]: desired direction that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vegetative growth is focusing on
growing leaves and stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants tend to be more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetative steering can be used at any
stage of growth, not just in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: stages, but within the flowering stage in
order to prevent the crop from finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then generous steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generous steering is focusing on
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sends the signal to the plant that it
needs to reproduce, puts all of its energy
[SPEAKER_01]: into the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers can be used to make small compact
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to slow down the growth of
mothers if you don't want them to stretch
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steering can be used to increase yield,
potency, bag appeal by decreasing inner
[SPEAKER_01]: normal spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously switching the lights to 12-12
initiates flower, but you can also steer
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop through climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having overall higher temperatures is
more vegetative, while having overall
[SPEAKER_01]: lower temperatures is more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of mimicking the natural seasonal
changes the plant would experience in its
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Differences between day and nighttime
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having smaller decreases between night and
day temperature tends to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative, while having very large and
increasing differences between night and
[SPEAKER_01]: day temp tends to be more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changes in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having very gradual changes in
temperature between night and day tends to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more vegetative, while having very fast
and quick changes is more generative,
[SPEAKER_01]: puts a lot of stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having, well this slide's wrong,
but having a higher humidity in veg tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the plant more active,
while having a lower humidity in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air exchanges and pipe temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more for greenhouses, but you tend
to have less air exchanges in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to have higher temperatures,
you're trying to increase CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas in generative you're probably
trying to drop humidity, so you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: more air exchanges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pipe temperature, that's more for
greenhouse, so you'd have a higher pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, more heat to keep the plant
more vegetative, and then reducing that to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weird slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant staying with irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having increasing or overall higher
water content tends to be more vegetative,
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is manipulating the water content
within the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decreasing water content and lower water
contents overall is more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of telling the plant we're
taking away resources, put your energy
[SPEAKER_01]: into growing flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, it's dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water content decreases overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And manipulating when do you start and
stop irrigation, so having smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: decreases overnight or irrigating earlier
in the day and irrigating up to the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day is more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're applying more water to their plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger drybacks overnight or starting
irrigation later and ending earlier is
[SPEAKER_01]: more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking away resources from the
plant, you're drying back harder,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're stressing it out, so you're making
it more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high frequency of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of an aeroponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more time I can apply irrigations,
the faster I can get that plant to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: where conversely, once I start taking away
irrigations and I make it less frequent,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending the signal to the plant,
hey, you have less resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your energy into reproducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: ECs, so substrate ECs and dripper ECs tend
to be lower in veg and higher in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're providing the food that the plant
needs to grow and produce flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substrate temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having higher substrate temperatures,
again, are making the plant more active,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're uptaking more water, and in
generative stage, you're probably trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to slow that plant down, decreasing the
substrate temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you know this, we can start
creating an irrigation strategy designed
[SPEAKER_01]: around what you're trying to accomplish at
what stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing you have to do before
creating an irrigation strategy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to select a substrate and
understand how that substrate performs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The density of the substrate will affect
the water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry bag speed, how EC is refreshed and
held in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber orientation and particle size will
influence the irrigation capacity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vertical fibers tend to be more
free-draining, more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizontal fibers tend to hold more water
and are more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of substrate you have also
plays a role in how you irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a small, tiny volume of substrate
requires you to irrigate more often,
[SPEAKER_01]: while having a larger volume of substrate
allows you to irrigate less frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll typically see in commercial
greenhouses where growers are using a
[SPEAKER_01]: small volume of substrate to veg the plant
out to get it very vegetative,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow it very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they stick it on another substrate
volume that's much larger, so it allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you to take away irrigations and be more
generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The initial wet-up sets the stage for the
whole growth cycle, and it will carry all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through the entire life of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At scale, wetting lines and watering booms
can save a lot of labor and reduce water
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption, and they're actually much
more affordable than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even just watering one with a coarse
spray is just as effective and is more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all methods require that you make
three slow passes to fully wet up that
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some larger substrate volumes,
you have to do more than three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pH-adjusted nutrient solution is
required from the start, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: rockwool, because rockwool has no nutrient
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend that you condition your
rockwool with a 1,5 EC just for cuttings
[SPEAKER_01]: and going up from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using no nutrient or a low-strength
solution at the start will create weak and
[SPEAKER_01]: soft plants and carry all the way through
the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you do the initial wet-up,
it's important to check the weights of
[SPEAKER_01]: your substrate to ensure that they're
fully saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tray weights should be recorded after
initial saturation and after cuttings are
[SPEAKER_01]: placed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular measurements should be taken of
those trays to determine when to apply the
[SPEAKER_01]: first irrigations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same goes for block weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you wet up that block, you need to
test a couple of those blocks to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're all been wet up correctly and
they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want to check to see between
batches if they're all wetting up the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, because if you have one batch that
holds less water or more water,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to change the way you irrigate
the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on environment and genetic,
you should wait until the tray or the
[SPEAKER_01]: block reaches about 30% to 50% less the
initial weight before applying the first
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hand watering and dipping of trays is not
a precise way to apply irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry could really benefit
from adopting commercial systems for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ebb and flow systems are the most commonly
used at scale, but NFT systems can also be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to really control the application of
water after initial cuttings are placed or
[SPEAKER_01]: in vetch.
[SPEAKER_01]: These reduce labor and also allow the crop
to be more consistent and uniform,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you're hand watering,
one block may get more water than the
[SPEAKER_01]: other, and then one block will dry out
faster than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice in your canopy, there's that
one plant that just fell behind the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before talking about irrigation strategy
for vetch and flower, we're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picture here is an example of the first
two dry backs for young tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a five-day period, the blocks dry
back slowly from a very high water content
[SPEAKER_01]: down to about 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not typical, but big drawbacks
like this promote good rooting in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also can be very generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They slow the plant growth down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice if you don't apply water to
that plant over the course of a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just going to sit there and not grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's recommended, depending on the
substrate and the genetic, to apply more
[SPEAKER_01]: frequent irrigations in the beginning
before allowing the substrate to dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have a water content
sensor, if you can't measure it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor itself, you can measure the weight
of the block to determine the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: you irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This graph here is the ideal irrigation
chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't focus on the frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes depending on your substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideal irrigation is broken up into
three phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first phase builds up water content,
dilutes the nutrient solution in the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate, and it's providing new solution
for the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to gradually build up water
content to achieve drain on time without
[SPEAKER_01]: channeling, without pushing that water
straight through and into draining.
[SPEAKER_01]: In P2, the timing of first drain is
important because it keeps the EC in the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate under control while the plant is
working its hardest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Achieving drain too early will not only
create channels, but will not allow for
[SPEAKER_01]: proper resaturation of the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not re-wet correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting drain too late spikes the EC when
the plant's working its hardest,
[SPEAKER_01]: causing unnecessary stress that affects
the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In P3, we stop irrigation several hours
before sunset, lights off, starting to dry
[SPEAKER_01]: back before the end of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adjusting this dry back can play a
significant role not only in root
[SPEAKER_01]: development, but how you're steering the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So general principles to consider when
creating an irrigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the golden rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden rule is transpiration before
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the plant to actively start
uptaking water before you apply that
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, if you have a sensor,
you're looking for a one and a half to two
[SPEAKER_01]: percent dry back before that first
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In P1, typically larger volumes are used
in the morning to build up water content,
[SPEAKER_01]: and achieve drain on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, a one percent dry back,
or at least a 30 minute rest time,
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed between irrigations in order to
prevent channeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: In P2, smaller volumes are used to
maintain the ideal water content in the
[SPEAKER_01]: EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, you want to achieve a one to
two percent dry back between each
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation, but for some varieties that
don't like wet feet, you can do a three to
[SPEAKER_01]: four percent dry back between each
irrigation event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hasn't been studied well,
but some growers do like to achieve much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger dry backs within the day in order
to be more generative, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended to do this early on because it
will make it much harder for you to re-wet
[SPEAKER_01]: your growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in P3, stop time has a significant
effect on root development and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: steering, and should be adjusted carefully
throughout the cycle with the goal of
[SPEAKER_01]: steering the crop, or steadily increasing
dry backs towards the end of cycle to be
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly generative at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, you're achieving 10 to 15
percent dry backs overnight in veg and
[SPEAKER_01]: early flower, but in late flower,
you can achieve 20 to 30 percent dry backs
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight to increase vegetative steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing is volume of
water applied is directly related to the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of substrate you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's an example of substrate volumes
and their irrigation shot sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the volume of substrate determines how
much water you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is true for all types of growing
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three percent shot sizes are more
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, basically, you're taking the volume of
substrate you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you have a liter of substrate,
I'm going to apply a 30 mil shot every
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to be more generative,
I'll apply a six percent shot or something
[SPEAKER_01]: larger than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can adjust these shot sizes,
but generally, you should stay between
[SPEAKER_01]: three to six percent shot size range in
order to prevent channeling or
[SPEAKER_01]: underfeeding the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start times, start and stop times in
relation to dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adjusting the start and stop times
controls the dry back overnight plays a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant role in how it's developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers here are referenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's important to know that you don't
want to just jump from one of these to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other, and you want to make very small
adjustments over several days in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: work the plant into the steering that
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of cycle, you want to
achieve these bigger dry backs towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in addition to irrigation strategy
playing a role in crop steering,
[SPEAKER_01]: it controls the EC in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you can actually play with water
content EC by adjusting the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: water applied and its frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, short watering events prevent drain,
raise water content, and raise EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long watering events creates more drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: A high frequency of watering increases the
amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers EC, raises water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less frequent waterings decreases the
amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises the EC in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lowers water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, measuring drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is critically important to measure how
much water is applied versus how much
[SPEAKER_01]: drain is achieved on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a measure of how much water the
plant is using, a check on plant health,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ensures irrigation systems are working
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps to ensure that you're not only
over-watering or under-watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, this should be used as a
measurement every day to create your next
[SPEAKER_01]: day's irrigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important to know when you
achieve the first drain of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will help you prevent channeling in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on substrate type, you will want
to achieve drain one to three hours after
[SPEAKER_01]: that first irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Achieving drain too early causes
channeling and makes it much harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: re-wet that growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drain percentage versus expected radiation
for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the amount of drain needed depends on
climate conditions and how the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under low light conditions and mild
climate conditions, less drain is required
[SPEAKER_01]: because the plants are not taking up as
much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under high light intensity and really hot,
humid environments require higher volumes
[SPEAKER_01]: of drain in order to maintain stable water
content in EC in the root zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also makes sure to even out any
inconsistencies in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's like if you have one plant that's
higher or lower in water content,
[SPEAKER_01]: achieving drain should allow you to even
those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the precision drain volumes listed
here, it's not only good for plant growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for your bottom line, reducing the
amount of nutrient and water that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: sending down the drain, and it's better
for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drain EC is not representative of what's
in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use drain EC or pH as a primary
indicator for adjusting EC and pH
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations at the dripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher EC in the drain is normal,
as the drain contains the old nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that were held in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH of the drain is influenced by the
plant's interaction with the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: solution and can be used as an indicator
of how the plant's performing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it shouldn't be your deciding factor
on how you feed that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you need to correlate what's going
on in the drain and the root zone and how
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is actually performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substrate EC in relation to radiation for
vegetables Substrate EC needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusted based on light and climate as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substrate EC can be significantly higher
than we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see in vegetables under low
light conditions for tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have an EC as high as eight in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not uncommon to see two to three ECs
in veg and getting up to five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six plus EC in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we discussed previously, substrate EC
can be controlled by manipulating the
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency and volume of the irrigation In
general, EC at the dripper should never be
[SPEAKER_01]: changed more than 0.5 EC per day and you
should never apply just plain water in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that you have all this information,
you can make your own schedule of EC,
[SPEAKER_01]: water content, climate set points
throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having these clear set points can be used
with crop registration and historical data
[SPEAKER_01]: to ensure that the crop is developing
consistently, can help your staff catch
[SPEAKER_01]: problems before they spread, and the
historical data can allow you to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start conducting tests with
different substrates, with different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, with different growing
techniques, you can compare how they
[SPEAKER_01]: affect that crop or that genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, precision growing is
important for continuous growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually developing high quality plants,
yield, and cost management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants can be steered by climate,
irrigation, and labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants response to irrigation strategies
are the same regardless of substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more relevant information you have
as a grower, the more data you have that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use to compare to, the better off
you're gonna be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see some hands for questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's your opinion on no runoff at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it depends on what growing media
you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some substrates require you have
runoff, but that's something that GrowDan
[SPEAKER_01]: is focusing on, is zero discharge
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible, and you just have to
pick the right substrate that allows you
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I had kind of a similar question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems like rock-wool type of
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you're using super soil,
and you're using compost teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing completely organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to measure that EC content
coming out, and do I need to water it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where it's actually draining
every day, if it's completely organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to achieve drain every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the problem with using organic
nutrient solutions in a drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system is that you can't use pressure
compensation because, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to use pressure compensated
systems because you have to flush the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines almost every time between each
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So assuming you don't have that problem,
you can use organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work for soil the same way as it
worked for rock-wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference being you will have to
achieve probably more drain at certain
[SPEAKER_01]: stages than you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: With other substrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: More questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, she's not allowed to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does she know your stumpers?
[SPEAKER_03]: What flow rate do you recommend irrigating
rock-wool at, and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so for rock-wool, I typically
recommend a low flow rate, so a half
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon per hour or less, in order to
prevent channeling because rock-wool is
[SPEAKER_01]: more porous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you throw a lot of water really
quickly, you will create channels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing media and you won't re-wet it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know you're just a little bit
embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you asked about or you suggested that
doing measurements like this on a daily
[SPEAKER_02]: basis, kind of in the morning,
in the afternoon, I guess as you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: your cycles, is there any value in
increasing the frequency of those
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements during the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, the one would be like,
when do you achieve drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much of drain maybe you've
achieved at a certain point in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's hard enough to get somebody to
measure their drain and the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: water applied on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd usually start there, but I think
another point would be, when do you
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve that drain?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the tipping point you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got time for one more question if
you've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
