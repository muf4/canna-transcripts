[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis enthusiasts live somewhere
in the murky area between science and bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all aspire to have accurate
information, but because of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a lot of good answers to
many important cannabis medicine questions
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for many, it's easier for them to
give you their best guess rather than say
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it goes with so many cannabis
educators as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard to get a speaking gig on
cannabis medicine at a cannabis convention
[SPEAKER_00]: without any actual scientific or medical
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a multitude of speakers and
panelists who were simply parroting what
[SPEAKER_00]: they heard from someone else or something
they read in an unsourced internet post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many medical cannabis speakers vaguely
explain the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you ask follow up questions,
reply with additional vagueness and
[SPEAKER_00]: platitudes, but not very much detail or
scientific rigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the charlatans and carpet
baggers that degrade our community as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a new breed of cannabis
educator ready to replace these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are well educated, well spoken
enough, confident enough, and full of
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and the right intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing more and more of a new
generation who are able to study cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine or the cannabis plant in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They combine the highest ideals of our
community with the knowledge that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from rigorous study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am exceptionally enthused by this new
generation of cannabis leaders and look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to working with them and someday
handing off the baton to them as they take
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is someone that you follow online
that has the depth and accuracy of
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you respect, take a
moment and tell somebody about them or
[SPEAKER_00]: make a post to your social media about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intentionally help their message rise
above the noise of charlatans so that more
[SPEAKER_00]: of your friends and family have the
opportunity to learn from someone offering
[SPEAKER_00]: real science and real actionable
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shining light on good cannabis people is
an act of cannabis activism.

health, business, and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and with good cheer,

[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Miyabi Shields,
PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Shields is co-founder of Real Isolates
which, ironically, focuses on the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of secondary plant components
and synergistic cannabis blends,
[SPEAKER_00]: so essentially whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi received their PhD in
pharmaceutical sciences focusing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry of the endocannabinoid system
from Northeastern University in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi has authored or co-authored six
peer-reviewed publications and presently
[SPEAKER_00]: has a patent under review for a novel
fungus and plant extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi also has a substantial list of
honors and awards including a 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: International Cannabinoid Research Society
pre-doctoral research award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their TikTok channel, at Miyabi PhD,
has 130,000 followers and is where I first
[SPEAKER_00]: met Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to focus on the detailed
mechanics of the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: and further understand how cannabis
medicine works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid
receptors in the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do that by binding with those
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they do what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is actually going on at a
chemical level when a cannabinoid pings a
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cannabis educators just kind of
generally explain agonist and antagonist
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave it at that, but my audience
really wants to understand what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: at that granular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would please explain what's
going on at that point of the receptor and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe include why some cannabinoids act
upon some receptors and not others.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to dive into structural
biochemistry then, but a protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: so receptors are proteins and not protein
like nutritional protein that we eat in
[SPEAKER_01]: our diet, but a protein molecularly just
means a long string of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the receptor is this giant
ribbon of amino acids, which it's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: long molecule and it forms these different
shapes and receptors like the GPCR,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a type of receptor, which is what
the cannabinoid receptors are,
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to be these shapes that have like
seven helixes or cylinders and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: arranged in such a way that they're
floating around in our membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what actually happens when a molecule
binds to a receptor is that it changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: shape very, very slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that change in shape, which we call a
change in conformation is what activates
[SPEAKER_01]: or inactivates the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like, it's this amazing process
where when THC binds to the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it changes the shape of the receptor
by binding it, all of a sudden this new
[SPEAKER_01]: area of the receptor becomes available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you're imagining these seven
cylinders all kind of floating around,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden when THC binds,
it arranges the seven cylinders,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, such that this other patch is
available that starts the signaling
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a signaling cascade that
happens afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of why certain molecules have
different actions or can bind to different
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors, that comes down to three
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one is shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, everyone's heard square peg
round hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with receptors and with
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a binding pocket for most
molecules, which is on the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a piece of the receptor that's
shaped such that it can accept these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the CB1 receptor, THC binds,
you know, somewhere towards the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it binds every single time in the same
exact way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it fits into this shape like a
square peg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another molecule that doesn't fit into
that pocket will not bind to that
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing is charges,
like positive and negative charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in chemistry, there are partial
positive and negative charges and just
[SPEAKER_01]: like magnets, they attract and repel one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inside, in addition to the binding
pocket having a very specific shape,
[SPEAKER_01]: there also are very specific charges,
almost like a magnet that interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: the charges on THC or a CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That then help to bind it even closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third thing is what's called
van der Waals interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really a metaphor for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think of it like fatty Velcro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because molecules that are very fatty,
like the cannabinoids, which are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, extremely fatty molecules,
they can have these interactions with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other where they kind of stick to other
fatty molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the third thing that kind of
binds these molecules to the receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have a matchup between the
shape, the charges, and the fatty Velcro
[SPEAKER_01]: for a molecule to have what's called
affinity to a receptor, which just means
[SPEAKER_01]: that the molecule will bind to the
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next step further will be
what happens to the receptor when that
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule binds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you were mentioning about like the
different ways in which a molecule can
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with a receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is often called a partial agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a CB1 receptor, that means that it
turns it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only partially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because when THC binds,
it changes the shape to turn the receptor
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other molecules that can also
bind to the receptor, but they change the
[SPEAKER_01]: shape in a different way that leave the
receptor off.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called inverse agonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are molecules that bind and
don't change the shape at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are called neutral antagonists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, and that's just, you know,
those are the three main ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a large array of other
interactions that molecules have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea that you've got these
spirals and the cannabinoid approaches the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, and those excite somehow and
then reveal this lock that the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: may or may not have the appropriate key
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the receptor get excited to reveal
that lock to every cannabinoid that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: by?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like that would use a lot of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does the receptor know when it's being
approached by the cannabinoid if it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: right one that it should change shape for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually what's the most,
like what's the most fascinating thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: me about biochemistry is that nothing is
conscious and nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These receptors and enzymes, the proteins,
all the signaling molecules, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids, phyto cannabinoids,
like THC, CBD, serotonin, serotonin
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors, all of these, none of them are
consciously aware of things approaching or
[SPEAKER_01]: are not approaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is just happening based on a
chemical equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything actually in our whole
entire bodies pretty much occurs due to
[SPEAKER_01]: forces of enthalpy, which is energy and
entropy, which is like a measurement of
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder and chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything in the universe tends
towards disorder and chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between those two factors,
it's just like whether or not something is
[SPEAKER_01]: statistically likely to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the receptor is sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The receptor is in the membrane and it's
empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could say that it's waiting for a
molecule, but really it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have THC molecules
floating around, at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, there will be enough THC
molecules present that it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: energetically favorable for it to bind to
the receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I mentioned earlier about the
shape, the charges, and the fatty Velcro
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrophobic interactions, those three
things determine how energetically
[SPEAKER_01]: favorable it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the affinity determines how little or
how much you need of a certain drug to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the receptor to what you call to get
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's all based on whether or not
it's favorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things are just kind of floating
around, like waiting to interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether or not they interact depends
entirely upon how closely they are shaped
[SPEAKER_01]: to one another and attract one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a non-conscious thing that is
looking to continually bring the energies
[SPEAKER_00]: into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it sounds like to a certain degree
how the likelihood of the receptor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid interact is a level of
subtlety that might just be based on luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to put them next to each
other, but we don't even necessarily know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're going to interact until they
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rather than luck, it's based on
chemical affinity or properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not luck because the receptor has
a shape that happens to fit the molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about it as like,
okay, if you and I are in two boats
[SPEAKER_01]: floating in the ocean and then we're
bumping into each other, whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: the boats will stick to one another
depends on how strong the magnets and
[SPEAKER_01]: Velcro we have on the outside of the boats
are to one another, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is exactly like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like luck in a certain sense, the
molecules are just kind of floating
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether or not it chooses to interact
and it's not necessarily a choice,
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends upon how strongly they're
attracted to one another by these chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's predetermined in some sense where
the more of a molecule you add to the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, the more of them that are
present, the higher the statistical chance
[SPEAKER_01]: or the likelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is exactly as you described,
although I wouldn't say that it's luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's chemically and
energetically favorable at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I regretted using luck as soon as I said
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm talking to a hard scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what you're saying though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not conscious though, which is,
it is something amazing to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I go to snap my fingers,
like, you know, when I snap my fingers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chemical reactions that occur that
allow me to snap those fingers at a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain point, there is a conscious
thought that goes into beginning that
[SPEAKER_01]: cascade, but all of the molecular
interactions that occur are actually just
[SPEAKER_01]: energetically favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I'm glad that when we,
you know, we go to snap, the probabilities
[SPEAKER_00]: are that it happens, you know,
pretty much without fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those probabilities are
predetermined by our signaling systems and
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's just how amazing it's
miraculous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's amazing that we can
think about snapping our fingers and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for most of us and most of the
time, if you know how to snap your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers, it'll just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's pull out a levels of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many of these cannabinoid receptors
do we have in our body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, it's, it's a lot of
people, you know, when I, when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: brought into cannabis medicine,
I was taught that, um, the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors you have are not related to body
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it has everything to do with your
particular ability and likelihood to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: more receptors, but more and more in
dosing, I'm seeing from people giving
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing recommendations based on body
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which as far as I'm aware, doesn't match
the science as I learned it five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the state of the art now about
how many of these receptors we have and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any relationship to body mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I can't say this for absolute
fact, but I do not think that the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of receptors are related to your,
your body mass, like at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they, they change all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing that we're not like
well aware of and that we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that there are a lot of, um,
interactions with our environment and with
[SPEAKER_01]: our diet and yes, using cannabis that
changed the density, what's called a
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor density, uh, for CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and also something you
pointed out is how many, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally we talk a lot about CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll talk about the CB2
receptor, which is generally, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: attributed to the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we rarely talk about the other
receptors beyond that, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there's multiple and there's also
receptors that we originally classified in
[SPEAKER_01]: different systems that interact with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is going to get a
little bit into the weeds here in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: like separating out different receptor
types for, for specific purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I personally don't believe that the
systems are separated at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the endocannabinoid system is
integrally linked to the serotonin system,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dopamine system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all pretty, the GABA system,
there's actually an endocannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_01]: is dopamine plus arachidoneal acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, there's a, there's a
serotonin, um, arachidoneal amine too,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethanolamine as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, those are like rare
endocannabinoids and we, we don't research
[SPEAKER_01]: them as much as we've researched or we,
we haven't yet researched them as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: we've researched, um, the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also is fascinating because the CB1
receptors and the CB2 receptors have been
[SPEAKER_01]: shown to, to dimerize, which means they
bind to receptors in, in other systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for the dopamine, it'd be the D2
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and it's been shown that if they
dimerize and if there's more than one type
[SPEAKER_01]: of receptor, that it will have a different
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're still in the, even though
receptor pharmacology has, there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of work and a lot of amazing progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think we're in the early,
you know, in the early stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding these receptors,
how they interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then to, to go further into your
question about like dosing and knowing how
[SPEAKER_01]: much is good for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't think that there's any way
to judge that from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I can't think of any way that you
would know, honestly, other than starting
[SPEAKER_01]: small and starting with the least amount
possible and titrating up slowly until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get your desired effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because- Everybody's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with the endocannabinoid
system, it's a chicken or an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Situation where since it's so connected to
the other systems, any change in any of
[SPEAKER_01]: those systems will cause changes in the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there is this theory, it's a theory,
although I believe there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that many of us have what's called
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that we have less circulating
endocannabinoids, which actually means we
[SPEAKER_01]: have more cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this can cause a slew of problems
from like GI issues, mental health,
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's, you know, it's still,
it's still in the early stages to being,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're, we're still early to being able to
understand all of this and how genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: play a role in, into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we, when we had, uh, Dr. Russo on
a few months back and we'll heck probably
[SPEAKER_00]: a few years back now, we had him on to
talk about his, uh, clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, he, he talked about this,
this evolving idea of the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, endocannabinoid tone, the cannabinoid
tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and he said at the time that,
you know, we weren't really sure how we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to measure it, but,
but people were starting to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary to talk about the general,
I don't know, veracity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids present in the body,
you know, whether you had many or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not you had few or, or whether or not
your system was sluggish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we haven't talked to him about
that in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're not Dr. Russo,
so I'm, I'm asking for your opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not his, of course, but, um,
what are you seeing as the state of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, you are, you are a re
you know, a more recent PhD and you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the trenches doing, you know, basic
cannabinoid science every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this idea of the cannabinoid tone,
is it, is it still being played with or
[SPEAKER_00]: have we moved past that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believe that I have low
endocannabinoid tone and I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: other scientists who feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's really, there is no way
of clinically testing it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I went to my doctor and I
asked, Hey, can you check the level of my
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first of all, they don't have a blank
stare, a test to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, second of all, it's,
it's really, really difficult to measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids because they,
um, they degrade, they oxidize really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really easily there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many reasons why the
endocannabinoid system has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a little bit sluggish in research
behind like other salt systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: like serotonin and dopamine are like salt
based systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're cooking in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to clean a glass that had salt
water in it than it is to clean a glass
[SPEAKER_01]: that had like butter mixed with maple
syrup in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's the same when you get to
the molecular scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if not, if not, maybe even a little
bit more difficult when things get sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in going back to the
endocannabinoid tone and the state of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I think that there is a lot more
research coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like more recently, um, I've seen some
more clinical data on, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different instances of people with chronic
health conditions where they're finding,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this has, they have low
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the ones that come to mind are autism
spectrum disorder and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, both there have been clinical studies
for both of those populations that show
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have a decreased amount of
circulating endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and with PTSD, they've actually shown
that that either it's a chicken or an egg,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an increase in the number of CB
one receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in theory, if you were,
you know, to have a clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid deficiency and like,
you know, I'll just talk about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I have low endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't make enough of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this is how cannabis helps me
because the molecules in cannabis mimic
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have a subthreat, I have a low
level of endocannabinoids and it causes me
[SPEAKER_01]: a myriad of symptoms really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I use cannabis products,
my body is feeling like a restoration of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance because even though I'm low in
endocannabinoids, I'm giving my body phyto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that restore that,
that signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that does, does that make
sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I would think that
just about everybody is experiencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at what the general causes
are, which are, you know, generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, stress, questionable stress,
street sleep, questionable nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental toxins, and immune
suppressing pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's American life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny you mentioned nutrition because
the endocannabinoids are omega six fatty
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we often, we often don't think
about how, you know, pushing for a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, uh, you know, high carb,
low fat diets would affect your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's most people, um, potentially have a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing to say though, is that
like, you don't know this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is the only thing left
clinically is to, to actually go in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's, it's in progress to
answer, to go all the way back to
[SPEAKER_01]: answering the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is in progress and I, I do believe
I have spoken to many people who believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that endocannabinoid deficiency is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so far in terms of like a theory
and in calling it a theory, there hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been anything to refute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so here around here, we pretty much
take it as facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting actually to hear,
you know, um, uh, frontline scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you referring to it as a theory
because we're all like sold already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, yeah, gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, gravity is a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's talk, you really attracted my
attention when you said that over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of our lives, the amount and sorts
of receptors that we have come and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's super interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the point is, the part that,
um, you know, you mentioned that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are, are fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, last episode we had, um,
Dr. Chris Spooner on, and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging everybody to take a fish oil
supplements as a, as a way to support your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you kind of like a,
a big, a big area question and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take it where you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know if our receptors
increase and decrease during our lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they, is, is this increase and
decrease more related to, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I want to know what factors are,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it age?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of us want to, I would think
want to increase the number of receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: in our body so that we can process more
cannabinoids for our overall health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would want to build those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are things that we can do or
awarenesses we should have at times out of
[SPEAKER_00]: life that the, the number of receptors
would go down, that would probably be good
[SPEAKER_00]: information for us to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I do want to point out that for
some people, it would be good to have your
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor levels actually go down,
which would be like making more
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to find, you're trying to
find the right balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of us have too many receptors and
some of us have not, not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's interesting about the
omega-3, uh, for fish oil supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my very first research project ever
was looking at, um, omega-3 and omega-6
[SPEAKER_01]: dietary factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and seeing like what changes that had
on, on a cosenoids and which are
[SPEAKER_01]: downstream of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, so in terms of what causes
the changes in receptor density,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a number of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age is certainly a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lean away from just saying everything,
because that's just a non-answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but unfortunately it's, it's pretty
much true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, age is certainly a fast factor
because the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_01]: really important for our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge number of very important
processes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, the basic, the basic ones are
metabolism, immune system, and
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, and then overall brain
activity, brain hyperactivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so those are really, really important
tasks and they have different needs
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on whether or not we're still
growing as we're children or as we,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as we age and, and mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so age is certainly a factor and,
and it does change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other factor that you mentioned,
stress, stress is a factor, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: because cortisol and elevated levels of
stress factors in the brain will change
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and this is where we, we get into the
chicken and the egg because it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether, like whether the
endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dysregulation of it is the source of the
problem or whether it's a symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, an unbalanced, a quote
unquote, like unbalanced or dysregulated
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system has been associated
with all almost every single disorder or
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I don't think I can think of a
single one that hasn't been associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with the endocannabinoid system,
other than like genetic mutations or
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic disorders, um, that have a very
clear like molecular mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny cause that's kind of a
challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's great to have this one herb
that can help us in so many ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also has caused so many people to
say, Oh, what is with this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about it like it's a panacea,
like it's like it's solves everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and what I try to tell people is
like, no, it doesn't solve everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just solves one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one thing is the endocannabinoid
system and it touches all the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it very hard for people to
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a great way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way, the way that I usually explain it
is that, um, you know, the, the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are really powerful
anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my personal belief that almost
all of these disorders come from like
[SPEAKER_01]: dysregulations and in inflammation and not
inflammation in terms of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I sprained my ankle and now my ankle
has swollen up and is inflamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, at the cellular and
molecular level, inflammation is just
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory signaling molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like you said about, about,
you know, endocannabinoid tone being kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of an American having low endocannabinoid
tone being an American feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a lot of evidence that
shows that having high systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation is, is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that we, we don't really have any
way of, of knowing or understanding where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at and our threshold until we remove
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, and like speaking from my
personal experience, like I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation all the time, stress causes
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also like chronic pain,
inflammation, GI inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's so many things with which I
think inflammation plays a mechanistic
[SPEAKER_01]: factor because it's, I mean, in terms of
our immune system, like what is
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation at the molecular level?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is the most basic way that our
body signals to itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, something is wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you think of it as like one cell
trying to talk to another cell in the
[SPEAKER_01]: body, um, when it releases inflammatory,
like inflammatory factors, it's trying,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is one part of your body,
one single cell trying to tell the other
[SPEAKER_01]: part of your body, Hey, something's wrong
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so it's, so having super high
levels of, of inflammation causes just a
[SPEAKER_01]: large number of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we often get like desensitized to it
cause we're just living with systemically
[SPEAKER_01]: high inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so when yes, cannabis has,
um, like, you know, people are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe it's a cure-all,
but I do believe that it's a powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory and that inflammation
plays a crucial role in most disorders and
[SPEAKER_01]: is really, you know, not like
underappreciated, but it's just that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not really talked about as inflammation
because in the general public,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we think of inflammation,
we think of like a swollen lip or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a bruised ankle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the signaling version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and inflammation is probably the most
basic cellular response to stress that any
[SPEAKER_01]: type of life has and that we developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's part of what's called the,
uh, the innate immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like our immune systems have two
different, two different sides of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inflammation is the most basic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis helps by being a powerful
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many symptoms that are
mechanistically related to systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've, so we've been talking about
how the endocannabinoid system is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated with all the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like what you said early on that,
you know, you, you actually see it all as
[SPEAKER_00]: one system, not really as discrete parts
because they're all, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: interplay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and in passing, we all just kind of
say, oh, you know, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is the body's homeostasis,
uh, device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it, you know, if something's running
hot, it cools it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's sluggish, it picks it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's great as far as like
copywriting goes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens at a, at a more chemical
level, like, like we did earlier on,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what happens that what, what is the
method of action that the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system takes to create homeostasis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the tip and it's,
it's different in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: body and different parts of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could even be different, but the number
one, like most generic way of describing
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be that it, it can quiet like
different cells and it tells things to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you hear people saying like,
oh, cannabis makes you slow or cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: reduces your brain activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, technically that's true,
but that's not always a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes there's too much brain
activity and it's desirable to quiet parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the brain that are not supposed to be
speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so if you think about the way that
we're talking about, I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling now from one brain cell to
another brain cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could think about it as a one way
street or like, have you ever played the
[SPEAKER_01]: game telephone where, yeah, where one
person whispers in someone's ear and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's one direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's how neurotransmitters fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go from when you have one brain
cell, they're like an end to end daisy
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the end to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have one neuron and then you have
what's called a synapse, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: place or the space between the neuron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a speaking neuron and a
listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a talking, a talking side and then
a listening side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the pre-synapse before is the
talking side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the post-synapse is the listening
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all of the classic
neurotransmitters, they fire from the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-synapse across the synapse to the
post-synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go from speaking side to listening
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoids are the only
molecules that go the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the endocannabinoids are created in
the post-synapse on the listening side,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they transport across the synapse in
what's called a retrograde fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like opposite, and they go to the
pre-synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially if you have a long daisy
chain, if let's, let's say in your
[SPEAKER_01]: telephone line of one way daisy chains,
you have one telephone in there that's
[SPEAKER_01]: talking way too loud or way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way for us to quiet it,
other than finding a way to go all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: around the daisy chain again, to quiet it
is through the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which talks in the opposite direction and
says, Hey, like, can you just be quiet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is scent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is actually scent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a particular chemical that's sent
upstream?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it is the endocannabinoid itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it goes and it will interact
with a receptor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then depending on the nature
of how it's talking, it'll either be a
[SPEAKER_00]: agonist or antagonist or a, would you say
reverse agonist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the, all the endocannabinoids are
some, not all of them, but the main ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide and 2-A-G are agonists,
partial agonists at the, at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going back to the,
the pre-synapse and post-synapse,
[SPEAKER_01]: the talking and the listening end,
you have the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get created on the listening end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the receptors are on the talking
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are being transported across the
synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bind to the receptors and they
activate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you activate the cannabinoid
receptors, it activates this very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: G protein that is inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that G protein follows a signaling
cascade that ultimately it changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: voltage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of, all of our cells have a voltage
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an, it's an electrical potential
to fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about it, like whether or
not a brain cell, let's say this brain
[SPEAKER_01]: cell is firing way too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you then synthesize the
endocannabinoids and then they activate
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoid receptors, the cannabinoid
receptors will change the voltage of that
[SPEAKER_01]: entire cell so that it's less likely to
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and please ask me a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, and because it's less likely to
fire, that is its response to the upchain
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, shh, like don't talk so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Miyabi, I really, there's
actually liberation in this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be the only one listening to you
going, oh my God, I've wondered this for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people are, most people don't
have this education and, and to have it be
[SPEAKER_00]: so contemporary that they can speak to us
in this level of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to go ahead and take our
first break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis scientist and
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_00]: their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And night owl seeds works tirelessly,
bringing you auto flower genetics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable, thriving, and with extraordinary
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night owl seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And night owl seeds really are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos and buy fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof is there and obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are complex and rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics,
like I am, you'll likely also love night
[SPEAKER_00]: owl seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night owl founder Daz worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_00]: years, including breeding Mephisto's much
loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing both night owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And night owl seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs, and desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night owl even has the secret owl society
text club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just text the word night owl, one word,
to 760-670-3130 for early announcements
[SPEAKER_00]: and exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about other upcoming drops by
[SPEAKER_00]: following the night owl seeds Instagram
too at Daz.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-A-Z.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your packs of night owl seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and Hembra
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's night owl seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family owned and providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_00]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a lion has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent, and space to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_00]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all-gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are the heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare, and Headband, and their
award-winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: delights just about everybody's palate,
especially when concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show Cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: II, which has a great THC high,
but looks so much like a fern that some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks can't even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_00]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: of Willie G's Lebanese land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are looking for regular,
feminized, or auto flowers, Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company has the gear to make this your
best growing cycle ever.

Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an auto flowering cannabis
enthusiast, this event's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Announcing the 2021 Auto Flower Cup,
August 6th, 7th, and 8th in Lillooup,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presented by Camp Ruderalis, this
gathering has something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Auto Flower Cup competition,
of course, but it's so much more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a Stunden Glass hookah lounge,
a pop-up magical butter chocolate shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and waterfront marketplace with an array
of vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be an old-school auto flower
seed swap, joint rolling competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cooking demos, solvent-less
squishing demos, and late-night
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary screenings of both Doast and
Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food will be lit too, including Chef
Sebastian Carrosi's award-winning classics
[SPEAKER_00]: like elk chili, Kobe beef kimchi dogs,
oyster po' boys, and razor clam chowder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the campfire chili and oyster
chowder cook-off, wild oyster harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom foraging, and s'mores around the
campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each day there, Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian
will teach about auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there will be presentations on closet
cultivation and hunting for psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The competition is open to everyone,
commercial and home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a category for photo period
plants too, so check out
[SPEAKER_00]: TheAutoFlowerCup2021.com for those
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, there will be plenty of cannabis
around, but due to state law, it won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: supplied by the event, but there will be
easy public toking, which is why this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly over 21 event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can camp, rent a cabin, or stay at a
local Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glamping and RV packages are available
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to say that Shaping Fire is a
sponsor of the event, and I'll be there
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to connecting with other
auto flower fans like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get all the details at

[SPEAKER_00]: And follow the Instagram at
TheAutoFlowerCup2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll see you in August at Auto Flower
Cup when we bring the auto flower family
[SPEAKER_00]: together to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis scientist and
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we were talking
about the endocannabinoid system itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: the system of receptors and how they work
to keep our body in homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, we could have continued on on
that topic, and it's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're gonna shift a little bit during
second set and focus on individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids because since most of what we
try to learn here on Shaping Fire are
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we can use either for our own
health or for the health of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that we love, we try to keep things very
usable, very actionable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start talking about individual
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miyabi, most of us have seen the chart
showing how cannabinoids degrade from
[SPEAKER_00]: starting as CBG or CBN and then degrading
down into other cannabinoids when exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to time or heat, I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really usually explained why
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've seen on your TikTok
many times you play with the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you've got an intimate
understanding of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd walk us through it,
what is happening and why is it happening
[SPEAKER_00]: at the chemical level?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're gonna basically go all
the way back and just talk about how that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in the universe I mentioned
earlier that in in the body everything
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down to a chemical equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, this applies to everything
in the entire universe pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not sure about I'm not sure
if you go way out into space if that
[SPEAKER_01]: applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but pretty much everything comes down
to basically energy and entropy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why these molecules degrade
is because if you leave them open to
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to have the molecules by
themselves, like in a complete vacuum and
[SPEAKER_01]: and or you can add what we call like an
inert gas, which is like argon or helium,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's a gas that is non reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to have the molecule,
and it were to be kept in the dark in some
[SPEAKER_01]: either a vacuum or a gas that's non
volatile, and if it were to be kept very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very cold, like as cold as you possibly
could keep it, it in theory, would be
[SPEAKER_01]: stable that way forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason why things degrade with
heat, light and exposure to air and oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: is because even though we see air around
us, and we don't think anything of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of things floating around in
the air, mostly oxygen and nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some other forms like carbon dioxide,
and and other depending on where you are
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's what's in your air,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, if you've heard that the
story where it's like, hey, you asked the
[SPEAKER_01]: fish, how's the water and the fish goes
like, what's water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're pretty much the same way with
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really think too much about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's plenty of things in air that
when you expose them over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll we'll come to have a chemical
reaction with these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabinoids are quite stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are certain areas of of it that
are prone to oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main chemical reaction that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly from there, things will
continue to break down because oxygen is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty reactive in terms of like the type
of of molecule or the types of atoms that
[SPEAKER_01]: you introduce, it introduces charges,
whenever you have charges around,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're likely to interact with other
charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why it occurs is just that
it's it's chemically favorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another reason why if you heat
if you heat things, you're giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: energy, and it just happens faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why heat is a factor is just
because it adds energy into the system
[SPEAKER_01]: speeds up the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To occur that would have occurred
regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's I guess if you look at a
molecule, there are certain areas of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain molecules that are more vulnerable
to degradation or to like an attack of an
[SPEAKER_01]: outside molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these things depend on how
these atoms are linked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how stable that link is to one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about it,
if you have seen my videos, and you see
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecules are held together by these
little plastic, you know, they're they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just bonded together by these little
plastic strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my model, all of those pieces of
plastic look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in real life, they're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're they're different strengths,
like, some of the atoms are held together
[SPEAKER_01]: by a fishing line and others are held
together by steel poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so different cannabinoids have got
their weak spot where they're at the most
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that will change when you once
you introduce a you oxidize it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then everything changes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things I found so
fascinating about chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning is just this crazy,
crazy amount of versatility and small,
[SPEAKER_01]: small changes in molecular structure cause
giant changes, you know, downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the the time of
efficacy for, you know, two of our most
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite cannabinoids THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for for caregivers everywhere,
we're often trying to explain to our
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, you know, the time frame that
they're going to get relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most most cannabis patients
that especially at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have a really good
understanding of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, most caregivers,
even the ones with their heart in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place might not have that great of
an understanding of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just know how to apply the medicine
in ways that tend to get relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, everyone is grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, there are faster acting
cannabinoids and there there are there
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be slower action of the
cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give you an example
that's pretty common for caregivers to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about, which I'm open to the
possibility that this is not true,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to defend my position if
this is wrong, like call it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very often when we talk about CBD,
people talk about benefits that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: now and benefits you get later.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you are having,
you know, an anxious day full of
[SPEAKER_00]: rumination, you can take some,
you know, whole plant CBD and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something with CBD dominant and
it will, you know, have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct the balance of chemicals and or,
you know, hit the receptors that that that
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease your experience of dysphoria,
of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so that would be your benefit
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the long term, for example,
after somebody has been taking CBD for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, four or six weeks, I'll often
hear back from them and they'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah, you know, I I started taking CBD
for my migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the diarrhea that I've had for
three years clear it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I explained to them, you know,
in layman's terms that one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of a strong endocannabinoid
system is that the system goes through and
[SPEAKER_00]: does housekeeping like cleaning the cilia
in the gut of the mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's there's essentially gifts
with purchase when you when you take CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you never intended,
but which are totally great to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very open to the possibility that
there's scientific mess in that example,
[SPEAKER_00]: me obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so feel free to, you know,
correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but essentially the part I'm trying to
get at is cannabinoid seems to have help
[SPEAKER_00]: now and help later.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does how what's up with that from your
viewpoint as a scientist?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that, first of all,
that it's not it's absolutely not a
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudoscience and that it's definitely
true that there are different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that are separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So help now would be what you would call
an acute effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's happening
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to use CBD as the example.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD actually has very low affinity for the
CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Receptors, but it has been shown to be
what's called an allosteric modulator at
[SPEAKER_01]: the CB1 receptor, which is just a fancy
way for saying it like binds to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different location.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's use CBD as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acute effect of CBD is when you are
actually taking the CBD and like it
[SPEAKER_01]: happens within like, let's say,
if you take it if you take it orally like
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tincture or an edible, you know,
it takes 45 minutes to an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like maybe it lasts like two
hours, maybe four hours that those effects
[SPEAKER_01]: that you feel right then are acute
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the effect of the molecule
binding to the outside of the CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually decreases the CB1
receptors activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an acute effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The help later that you described help now
being acute effect help later is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called a it's like a longer term effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually comes from how our body
restructures itself, our body does
[SPEAKER_01]: housekeeping, like you mentioned the
endocannabinoid system does housekeeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our body goes through all of its systems
and does housekeeping pretty much you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a constant state of managing what is
happening now and what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what your body does when let's say
you're taking a little bit of CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a bit of CBD every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what my body has done over time,
it is it's responded to that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get the acute effects from taking CBD
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's also these secondary long
term effects that happen later,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is your body restructuring and
changing certain levels of receptors and
[SPEAKER_01]: changing certain levels of
endocannabinoids and other like highly
[SPEAKER_01]: likely other signaling molecules like
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this may seem like a little
bit like scary that there's these two
[SPEAKER_01]: types of effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty much the entire premise
of like SSRIs and anti like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mood mood stabilizing medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of those also function in the same
way where they take a few weeks to to see
[SPEAKER_01]: actually whether or not they're going to
you know, have have a beneficial effect
[SPEAKER_01]: because they work on this what is a
secondary mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a longer term thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our bodies do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single receptor when it's when
it's activated will eventually go through
[SPEAKER_01]: a process to inactivate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of this is our body takes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our body like recycles the receptors,
you could think about it as like a
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it as a recycling
program, every time our body recycles
[SPEAKER_01]: these receptors, it's kind of like
counting and taking into account how many
[SPEAKER_01]: of each type is being recycled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will adjust the amount that it
creates like in response to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's I mean, I know we
don't want to put too much consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: into these processes, but it's like a
thinking machine itself itself calibrating
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what our body needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it's between knowing that
things are happening completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: like based on just chance or luck,
as you put it earlier, but as I was
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it chemical, like, chemical
affinity, and energy, everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's this magical combination
that is quite conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is the reason why this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is to try and keep us well and to try to
keep us alive and functioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And life is miraculous in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we move on, I want to hit on one
more example of this acute versus longer
[SPEAKER_00]: term impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about THC with
inflammation, since you sound like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: very deep on inflammation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about THC being useful both in
the moment acutely for inflammation pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then long term, for inflammation as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for lack of having heard a better
explanation, how I normally asked how I
[SPEAKER_00]: normally explain it to patients when they
stop me, you know, like after a talk or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, I'll say, well, you know,
if you take THC now, even at sub
[SPEAKER_00]: perceptual doses, you are decreasing some
inflammation now, but even more so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing your experience of the pain
that comes from inflammation now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes you feel like you have less
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you keep on taking THC every
three or four hours, the natural anti
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation characteristics of THC keep
on, for lack of a better term,
[SPEAKER_00]: beating down on the inflammation and or or
shushing, I guess, you know, telling
[SPEAKER_00]: telling those receptors to be quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then over time, the inflammation
goes down because those cells are not
[SPEAKER_00]: yelling as much that there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's the correct
science, but there does seem to be this
[SPEAKER_00]: dichotomy between THC is helping an
inflammation patient now in the next three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours versus a month from now when they've
been taking THC all that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, gosh, you know,
my my arthritis is significantly improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of I guess what I would say this has
to do with is that inflammation is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold or an exponential response where
you feel pain above a certain threshold,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of inflammation and your body response to
that by firing like, let's just call it
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pain signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a it's like a chain,
depending on where your inflammation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually rheumatoid arthritis runs in
my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wake up with stiff fingers all all
the time right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pain would originate in the nerves
of my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the inflammation originates in your
hand and that but you actually feel the
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's true that they have
anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also true that if you reduce
inflammation and you decrease the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of pain that you feel overall,
that you're decreasing the strength of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway of pain, which is something that's
you know, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a difficult topic and it's difficult
to prove.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this saying that have that
people neuroscientists say it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, I don't know if you heard it,
but it's neurons that fire together wire
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this is the this is the saying
because when you have brain cells that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in a circuit and they're used to firing in
this circuit, they become stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, if you think about them as
like roads, if you imagine like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're if your brain is totally naive,
it's like a desert or an area and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no roads, there's no point from A
to B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's just a dirt path.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start making the dirt paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then over time, you start using this
one path more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that's the pathway for
inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body becomes really sensitized to
that path because you're using it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not a dirt road anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns into a street that then turns
into a major highway that then turns it
[SPEAKER_01]: turns into the fastest route of signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our brain cells are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they fire together, they wire
together more tightly and it's easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to go down these pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's interesting, specifically with
pain, it's so difficult to piece apart
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not it's inflammation,
certainly, but also whether it's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitization to your body, even even
feeling pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is I don't have the answers for
this either.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just, you know, me talking out
loud, thinking about inflammation and how
[SPEAKER_01]: people feel inflammation and pain because
like from from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have chronic joint pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of injuries that I've been
told that these injuries are the cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also had a lot of scans and
things where I didn't disclose to anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had prior injuries and no one can
see anything structurally wrong with any
[SPEAKER_01]: and any part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this there's this piece that I
guess you cannot prove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is where is the sensitive like where
is the sensitization to pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is in the inflammatory factors,
which is the acute effect, which you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying part of it is that that first
effect, which is that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammatory factors there and that
cannabis can help by reducing that
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second part of it is breaking
the cycle of firing your pain cells all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time or your pain signaling pathway
all the time, because like the less than
[SPEAKER_01]: your body uses that pathway, the less
likely it will be to sort of follow down
[SPEAKER_01]: that pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been talking a lot about
just like entropy and chemical like
[SPEAKER_01]: statistical chance of something happening
and and everything in the body just runs
[SPEAKER_01]: downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meaning like the easiest path for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if and if it's the easiest path for
your body to feel pain because your body
[SPEAKER_01]: has been in pain for years and years and
years, it will be difficult to break that
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without removing the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's obviously the fact that
some there are some aspects of pain that
[SPEAKER_01]: are structural that are caused that the
cannabinoids can only help so much with
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have a nerve impingement or
something that's actually like causing
[SPEAKER_00]: like a physical cause, something that's
mechanically wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for from my opinion,
a big piece of the long term benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for chronic pain is breaking this
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in what I mentioned earlier in
the in the quieting or the shushing of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cells, because some of us are
hypersensitive to a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm I'm hypersensitive to a lot of
stimuli, not just not just pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but other types of things to write like
auditory stimuli or like certain types of
[SPEAKER_01]: like tactile feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we we don't know between
between person to person it you can't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: what what someone's threshold for pain is
because pain is completely subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we can only feel what we feel
in in our bodies, which is why those pain
[SPEAKER_00]: charts are always so unsatisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel seven today or six or
sometimes they show, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stick drawing faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, gosh, this is a fool's
errand from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as speaking from someone who's pretty
much lived like my entire life at like a
[SPEAKER_01]: five or above, like at a at a certain
point, it just starts becoming like a
[SPEAKER_01]: status quo and your body actually your
body actually can think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that if that makes sense, like your
body gets into these patterns that it will
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in some ways,
that's that's a way that the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: can help us by decreasing that that
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's there's another follow up
piece, which is that the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: the metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about THC and you mentioned
that, like, you know, if there's an onset
[SPEAKER_01]: of action and then it's metabolized by the
body and it's it is sequentially
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestered away in our fat and it gets
stored in our fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's one of the reasons why
you can test positive on a on a drug test
[SPEAKER_01]: for weeks and weeks afterwards is because
our body still is processing and releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: these metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using over a longer course of
time, then you have a buildup of these
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something called like the depo
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually something that is harnessed
for other medications like birth control
[SPEAKER_01]: is the first one that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizes the depo effect for like a long
term release, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a whole nother mechanism in
which like a long term effect of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can can build up and be slowly released,
because even though those metabolites are
[SPEAKER_01]: not psychoactive, it doesn't mean that
they're not still circulating at low
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, causing like anti inflammatory
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I think is is
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to my knowledge, I don't know if
either of those things have been like
[SPEAKER_01]: proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about tolerance breaks for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand that tolerance breaks are
good so that we can increase our
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that anybody who works
with patients knows that trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince a patient to go on a tolerance
break is very difficult because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for a lot of people, they get to
cannabis last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it works, they're all like,
well, none of the pharma works without
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible side effects and they hold on to
cannabis so dearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're telling them to,
you know, take two, three, seven days off,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seems unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think every all of us who work with
patients would would be served by having a
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding of what happens at a
chemical level during a tolerance break so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can make it more, you know,
more real, more mechanical for the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're trying to encourage to give up
their most effective medication for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you go through what happens in our
body during a tolerance break?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when when you are using cannabis
regularly and so I use cannabis regularly
[SPEAKER_01]: and I regularly take tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're using it regularly,
what your body does have a compensatory
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction, which is what I was describing
earlier, is it decreases the level of CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors that are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of an oversimplification,
because there are other changes that occur
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, when you have that
decrease in CB1 receptors, you notice it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to increase the amount of
cannabis that you use to get the same
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is at the this is kind of at the
crutch of tolerance is you your body has
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you know, I personally
believe that a certain level of tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: is beneficial for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain a low level of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I never I never take a tolerance
break to completely resensitize,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if I completely resensitize,
my body goes 100 percent the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes way too many CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, when you're talking to or
what would be my opinion, if I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis patients about tolerance
breaks and why they're necessary,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because you're trying to balance the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you use cannabis every day,
you're constantly lowering not constant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't happen like super quickly,
like not to don't want to make anyone look
[SPEAKER_01]: paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're lowering your level of CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as you use cannabis, if you use it
every day, you use it over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be lowering those CB1
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go on a tolerance break,
it allows your body to make more CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors and increase them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're kind of always shooting to find
a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just continuously use cannabis
and you never take a tolerance break,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're continuously developing tolerance
and you're going to be continuously
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering your CB1 receptor density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some people, there's not a huge
downside to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for others, there's big negative side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all depends on the patient and what
their goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the biggest problems with
tolerance is that when you develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance, then the cannabis is no longer
effective for what you need it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: effective for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just talking to another
scientist about this is that in our
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion, the reason why we take tolerance
breaks is because we need the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: work when we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that would be a way to describe
it to people who are maybe hesitant to try
[SPEAKER_01]: even taking a tolerance break is that you
don't want the plant to lose efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to stop working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's possible that that happens when
you develop tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also possible that continuing to
develop tolerance will lead to other
[SPEAKER_01]: negative side effects like having problems
sleeping or having like other like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some people who get withdrawal symptoms of
anxiety when they go to take a tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, the more tolerance you
develop, the more difficult it becomes to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always easier just to regularly
take, you know, build breaks into your
[SPEAKER_01]: routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, though, this is this is going
to be different from from person to
[SPEAKER_01]: person, because I feel like I'm
hypocritical even saying this because I do
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain a level of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I pretty much take I take very short
tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't take breaks that are longer
than a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't I don't completely resensitize
my system because my system as it is on a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete tolerance break is not a high
quality of life for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it I don't want to be I don't want to
like mislead or, you know, spread spread
[SPEAKER_01]: negative negative suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just like my experience is that I
do maintain a low a very, very low
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's it's all about finding
that balance and maybe explaining it in
[SPEAKER_01]: that way where you need the balance of
having the risk like the the relief like
[SPEAKER_01]: having the plant actually provide you with
an effective relief balanced with having
[SPEAKER_01]: the right level of receptors in your
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it makes a lot of sense,
too, because there are a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: who they do want to take some amount of
tolerance breaks so that the the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is more effective for them on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get their receptors and,
you know, cannabinoids more in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, going down to zero
tolerance could be very extreme as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know that if I if I have to stop
using cannabinoids for a while for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, when I come back, sometimes I get
so high that like it's it's dysphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or people who have got severe pain and
they use cannabinoids at work to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: their pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, if they were to go a
significant amount of time for a for a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they may just be like super stoned
at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there there really is,
you know, advanced patients with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience about cannabis really embrace
the whole idea of individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the beginning, we have to give
patients general ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it takes them almost
no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once a patient has got
cannabinoids, they become, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists of their own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's and it's great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's an amazing piece of,
you know, on one side, I know that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that people view as a very
negative thing about cannabis and about
[SPEAKER_01]: plant medicine just in general is that
everyone says, oh, it works for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people and it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's I think that that's an
amazing gift to be able to be empowered,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with with the option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that having like
guidelines, though, is like, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I was talking to someone new who is who
is just getting into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely would tell them to take
tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that tolerance breaks are
really great, you know, clarity or
[SPEAKER_01]: relativity where then you can approach
your use again every time you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to rehash exactly what
therapeutic benefits you're getting from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, how it's helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you more perspective,
I think, on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely would in the beginning,
like, advise people to take tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like you said, most of the time,
you know, if this when when cannabis works
[SPEAKER_01]: for someone and like you said,
it's a last resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have to admit like cannabis was
not the first thing that I tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in many ways a last resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was not I was not well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people are when you when you come
to that and you find something that works
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, it drives you to be so interested
in it, because especially in this
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition era, when we've been educated
or at least I was educated that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's nothing worse than being
an addict and that it's going to ruin your
[SPEAKER_01]: life and that it's this horrible,
horrible thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you experience this
relief from it that you don't get from
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that instills a passion of
understanding of health on on a deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the greatest
things about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think personal empowerment and personal
responsibility in our in our lives is
[SPEAKER_01]: important and and a huge positive thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would encourage like other people,
you know, listening and people that like
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the knowledge and the education
that there's always a lot of power in
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know scientists are always talking
about, you know, clinical research and
[SPEAKER_01]: having to have, you know, having trying to
have the most experimental, hard
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that research is necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that there is a huge,
huge amount of value in the personal
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and in the personal narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on the oral history of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one one last quick question
for you before we go to commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tolerance breaks that we're talking
about that don't get rid of all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance, but bring you down to,
I don't know, more usable levels while we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they are different for every
single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to recommend something to people
for their like first time until so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can start start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take one of these tolerance
breaks, you said you rarely do it more
[SPEAKER_00]: than a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but what's your regular like my
regular is 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go two full calendar days with with out
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and on day three, I seem to be,
you know, reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: What how does it work for you and what do
you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it all depends on what your
therapeutic minimum is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the therapeutic minimum is like the
smallest dose that you can use to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and each of us has a different
minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some people have a therapeutic
minimum far, far above mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's actually pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that you have a therapeutic
minimum that is like well above like 50
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of like an edible an edible
dose or something, something relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably mean that you would have
to take tolerance breaks more often if you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted them to be as short as what you and
I are talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, my normal thing is I go usually
somewhere between 36 to 48 hours at least
[SPEAKER_01]: every week and a half or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that seems to that seems to keep
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a regular schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did for a while when I proposed my Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was like, oh, I'm proposing my Ph
.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me also propose this other thesis in
my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually when I first
introduced CBD into my regimen and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping a notebook and I was writing
everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very rigid for about three years
with it and developed a routine that now I
[SPEAKER_01]: can sort of just send it to my friends by
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes if I have if it lines up
where I'm I'm free and I have like a time
[SPEAKER_01]: on the weekend to take like a macro dose
or a larger dose than I normally would,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beneficial effects can last for far
longer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's sometimes I like kick off my
tolerance break, so to say, with like a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger dose than I normally would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I experience benefits that last
for a few days after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can begin like what would be a
tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing that's important
about tolerance breaks that I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit on before we go to commercial is that
it's a it's a good time when you're on a
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance break also to think about your
diet and water intake and other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's just a good time to think
about it because you're already doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since you're already doing something
different and taking a tolerance break,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could think about really trying to,
you know, make changes like you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: about like fish oil supplements or like
even just in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unsaturated fatty acids, right,
like olive oil or coconut oil or fish or
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about about your diet and sleep
hygiene and other times I use tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks as times to think about my overall
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little mental retreat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more one more thing before we go to
break these tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just stop THC but keep using
CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to you stop all cannabinoids
because you're trying to give the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: system a break, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I never stopped taking CBD,
but that's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me personally and I use like
pretty low low doses of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't I don't experience I don't
experience any like tolerance with CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I love I use at much lower
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I definitely have spoken to people
like specifically people with seizures or
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines that use that benefit from like
larger doses of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will they will develop tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do cycle them in terms of like CBG,
CBD, THC, but THC is probably the only one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I take mandatory tolerance breaks
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as how the receptors respond as far
as like making more or making less,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially what we're trying to
do with the tolerance break, will it if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still taking CBD and we're not
taking THC, do the THC receptors go down
[SPEAKER_00]: in number as we want them to?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, CBD has almost like an
opposite effect on the CB1 receptor as
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, it would not, although I
can't say like with a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge that it's true because so here's
the theory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like THC activates the CB1 receptor and
it's that activation that causes the
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD actually like it doesn't
inactivate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It binds to the outside and it turns it
down like it turns down the volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it acts in a totally different
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not clear to me whether CBD has
changed, has caused changes in CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would need to look into that to see if,
if anything has been done before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not in theory, it doesn't interact
the same, the same exact way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're saying makes sense though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of this stuff that
we talk about that we have to go on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your educated intuition because
this research hasn't been done,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're certainly got a perspective and
a, and a vista point, a viewpoint of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, which is, you know, a lot better
than most of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'd rather go with your opinion
than, and then not know at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, this is also, it's my
opinion and maybe the study has been done
[SPEAKER_01]: and I haven't read it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's plenty, you know,
there's, there's, um, there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out and I am excited for us to,
you know, I am excited to see where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we go with research and like where
the information takes us, because I would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to know that is something that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, interesting, like CBD,
CBD, the largest, um, to me at least
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits I, in my opinion are happening
through the serotonin receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for me, but I use it for mental
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and CBD is really promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complicated molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's promiscuous, like it's not
necessarily a bad thing, but it binds to
[SPEAKER_01]: many things in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take that break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you are listening to Shaping Fire and
my guest today is cannabis scientist and
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of me at cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Specta and Pirates of
the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.

[SPEAKER_00]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding, healthy plants without
using excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought those cheap lights online,
and they're difficult to work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: fail in no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial-grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is IP66 wet-rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down, and of course, the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, it is built for the exact light
spectrum I want for great-yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look badass, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, and people love to argue online
about these needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to judge on PAR photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are, and the BIOS
[SPEAKER_00]: lights exceed my expectations in these
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth, while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior PAR efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love their attentive and
over-educated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers in
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have studied how light impacts

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis scientist and
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Miyabi Shields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Miyabi, we are to the part of the show
that I have been the most uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and I didn't tell you much about
this in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know your company that you
helped found, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not the point of the show today,
but it's called Real Isolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you are a pharmaceutical
chemist, and you spend a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at cannabinoid isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who aren't familiar,
we're talking about pure molecule THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: pure molecule CBD, whereas normally I'm
talking on this show about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the whole plant resin directly from
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, instead of pulling out the isolates of
the plant and then mixing and matching
[SPEAKER_00]: them like a pharmaceutical company would
to kind of, you know, build a medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more in the family of let's breed a
plant that affects, that has the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's just do a whole resin
extraction of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got a, we've got a,
you know, we've got a medicine directly
[SPEAKER_00]: from nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we talk about a lot on
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you are right there on the
front lines of this science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is your take on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you, you, you clearly
understand what I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: about whole plant medicine and the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also know that from what I
understand, a lot of your research is into
[SPEAKER_00]: these individual molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many of us, like, you know,
when CBD was really hard to find,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nowadays the price has crashed,
but, you know, six years ago, CBD was
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would, we would often recommend
to patients that they take a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: extract from a THC plant and then add
isolate to it to kind of artificially
[SPEAKER_00]: spike it so they could get the CBD that
the studies were saying they were needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh my gosh, I felt like I was making
or participating in Frankenstein medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so with, with that whole kind of set
up, what are your thoughts in comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant medicine versus the more
common use of CBD isolate, THC isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now God help us, you know,
Delta-8 isolate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, it's funny that you
mentioned that our company named Real
[SPEAKER_01]: Isolates is sort of a play on words
because there are, there is no such thing
[SPEAKER_01]: as a real isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do research and doing research
involves isolating these compounds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the, the efficacy of whole
plant extracts versus isolates,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are huge benefits to
chemodiversity that are undervalued and
[SPEAKER_01]: under researched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually our whole company,
which I know is now probably a misnomer at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time we thought it was funny,
Real Isolates, at the time we were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tell everyone about how there's no
Real Isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a science joke that no one
gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully people will get it
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually our, our entire, our entire
research is that we do, and everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: based upon, you know, this theory that
I've been working on that has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: chemodiversity and the potentially
essentially what you were just describing
[SPEAKER_01]: about whole plants, making crude extracts
with whole plants and the extremely,
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely complex pharmacology that comes
with crude extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about, have you,
have you heard of the, the three body
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in physics?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it's just a problem that says
in physics, in a vacuum of space,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have two planets or two bodies,
it's, it's very, very easy to derive a
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical equation that describes those
two bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very predictable and it's,
it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pharmaceutical chemistry is in many
ways a two body problem because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the one synthetic molecule, or in this
case, if you were looking at isolates of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and THC, you have the one molecule and
then you have the human body, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in physics, there's this problem where
instead of two bodies, you introduce a
[SPEAKER_01]: third body, like a third planet,
and they're all rotating around each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, it becomes impossible
to generate an equation to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: because it suddenly gets so complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis plant has over 400 unique
molecules in depending on the strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on like the genetics and the
chemo bar, depending on the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and how it's grown,
depending on the dry and cure process and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's dried and cured, then depending
on how it's extracted, whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: distilled, what are the distillation
parameters like fraction distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: versus short bath distillation,
it is a hundred plus body problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: like easily for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am at the point where like,
I embrace that problem because that
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred plus body problem has very
specific solutions that I don't believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that isolates can solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a personal opinion of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally believe that there are huge
advantages to chemo diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just a description of like the
number of total molecules that are in an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, I have huge success
making topicals with crude extracts of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and willow bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And white willow bark has the precursor
has salicylic acid in it, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: scaffold that we use to make aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition to salicylic acid,
it has a bunch of other rare, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rare derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of salicylic acid, similarly to how
cannabis has all the rare cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and flavonoids and other fatty
acids and bioactive molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we, do we understand exactly how
all of these things interact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, we don't understand that at all
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet where we could say,
I will give you a synthetic mixture of all
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 of these things to cause a very
specific effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that would be the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that would be, you know, that would be
the goal eventually of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're nowhere close to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, does the whole plant
have uncharted territory and uncharted
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for various specific
therapeutic effects and or increased
[SPEAKER_01]: effects for like a lower like risk
potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yes, I think that isolates,
not necessarily CBD isolate, but I'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll, I could talk a little bit more
about that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Epidiolex is the pharmaceutical CBD
formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dose for Epidiolex is extremely
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's in the it's in like,
for my weight, it would be like more than
[SPEAKER_01]: a gram more than once per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extremely, extremely high dose for it to
be efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously that's, you know,
seizure disorders require higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's my personal opinion that you
could potentiate CBD, meaning you make CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: more effective by giving it with other
cannabinoids that act synergistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a synergistic interaction means more
than additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are things that are difficult to
prove in a laboratory setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that people are working on it
and that it's it's being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in in the meantime, in terms in terms
of just like what my opinion is of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the whole plant extracts have
a lower risk potential for negative
[SPEAKER_01]: effects and potentially in many ways,
a higher efficacy, although there are
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no doubt advantages to
distilling and purifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't you can't argue that there there
are some advantages to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess just in the personal context,
I am a big fan and use crude extracts and
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, I'm very relieved
because I thought I was going into a
[SPEAKER_00]: debate with a scientist who loved
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, my God, how am I going
to hold my own defending whole plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here you are saying, oh,
actually, whole plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you know, is is is probably preferred,
which is a huge relief to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whole plant is really just a
combination of isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's but it's but it's not I mean,
it's kind of like contrary, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I by name isolate means you're
isolating one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there there are absolutely advantages
to isolate, although in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for chronic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like specifically we're talking about
tolerance and taking tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I didn't I didn't mention it
when we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's there's a very specific type
of withdrawal and acute withdrawal that is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up more and more called cannabis
hyperemesis syndrome or CHS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my personal opinion that that
develops due to a very, very specific type
[SPEAKER_01]: of tolerance and withdrawal to just THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's I don't it's not it's nowhere
near close to we're nowhere near close to
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding exactly how all of these
things work or whether or not this is this
[SPEAKER_01]: is like 100 percent the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take a whole plant extract
that has, you know, a large number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, the perfect example of
this, which is touching on my current
[SPEAKER_01]: research project is smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I I prefer cannabis smoke to the
edible experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that that's true for a majority of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I recently pulled I pulled all
my social media and got over 13000
[SPEAKER_01]: responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty much an overwhelming
majority of people prefer smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there's no doubt advantages to
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in a comparable way to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt advantages to
pharmaceutical formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But many edibles these days are made with
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made with very, very concentrated
and distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's not isolate is
practically isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on, you know, the dispensary,
the producer in the lab that's making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there it's often I think it's common
practice for people to distill above 85
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which basically means that you're taking
out everything else and you're hyper
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm kind of going in a
circle here, but I prefer smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always had and majority of people
prefer smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons why I believe that
is because smoking produces the most
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse formulation out of anything that
you possibly could intake in terms of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a crude edible extraction like butter or
RSO versus a distillate extraction versus
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distillate edibles are on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like isolates and distillate are on
one side of like the purest form of just
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or just CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then crude extracts or whole plant
extracts are in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then smoking is on the opposite side
in terms of just the total number of the
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity of the formulation of
cannabinoids that you're taking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, this has been my big
passion and something that I'm passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about researching for like for a while now
is why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking into it and, you know,
it would take a supercomputer and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: simulation to even be able to to begin to
predict the complex interactions like at
[SPEAKER_01]: the receptor level that occur with so many
different mixtures, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you have the fact that you
have like flavonoids and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: other bioactive molecules, like there's a
lot of factors to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you blew me away the other day when
you taught that even regardless of what
[SPEAKER_00]: your analytics say about your flour,
when you burn the flour, you are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing additional cannabinoids into
existence so that a burnt, a combusted
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, like in a joint or something,
is even more pharmacologically complex
[SPEAKER_00]: than what you think is in it when you look
at your lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's we always talk about the
negatives and the downside to smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't argue that there are some
negatives to smoking as a method,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are some benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some very, very unique
things that that occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, in terms of like what I was
mentioning about like dependent,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of what the flour looks like,
I mean, a lot of THC will get converted
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is it's a reactive molecule and
you heat it to a very, very high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flour has other reactive
molecules as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are all extremely volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's just the fact like when
we talk about combustion, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: true combustion means you're going all the
way down to CO2 and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do not fully combust the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're at the very,
very end of your bowl and it's all white
[SPEAKER_01]: and ashy, like, yeah, OK, that's,
you know, that's completely combusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're typically smoking,
you know, like when you're not running
[SPEAKER_01]: totally dry, like you're not fully
combusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're heating and extracting at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're also transforming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's I think chemo diversity has
a huge impact on the overall effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can tell you right now that like
no one will be able to convince me that
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking doesn't give me a different
formulation because it feels so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and there's so many specific effects
in terms of strain specificity that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: and perhaps I just don't have experience
with enough experience with strain
[SPEAKER_01]: specific edibles because, you know,
so many edibles are made with distillate,
[SPEAKER_01]: which distills them back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it simply crystallifies them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just know that the high is not
nearly as good smoking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate or actually any version of
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's let's finish with this
question because I don't want to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than we agreed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The when we talk about whole plant
medicine with many scientists at
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions, people tell me a whole plant
medicine is messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you're talking about the benefits
of chemical diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, I come from a place of
efficacy that just works so much better
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're talking scientist to
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you tell that other scientist who
says that, you know, cannabis resin is
[SPEAKER_00]: messy and uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we should go in a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them that real life is messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real life is pretty uncontrolled and that
I absolutely love the scientific rigor of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in the lab and minimizing
variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just not life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that this is something that
many scientists do and will in future
[SPEAKER_01]: disagree with me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very hesitant about talking
about it for for a long time for that
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, because I do agree that there is
it is messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I I agree that it's unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also can't help but think about
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, reality is messy and
uncontrollable and complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point, you know, just to
close, like the most important thing to me
[SPEAKER_01]: is helping other people improve their
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And efficacy is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just like this is just like a
thought, a little like thing, a seed of
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, most drugs that go to
clinical trial from like pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic drugs going to clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it's extremely expensive to
get them to a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time they get there,
the most common reason why they fail is
[SPEAKER_01]: not because they're toxic, but it's
because they are not efficacious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most common reason why a drug will
fail a clinical trial is because it just
[SPEAKER_01]: simply doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my question to another
scientist who would say that it's messy at
[SPEAKER_01]: my question would be like, so it's messy,
but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reduction of suffering is the
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that is the goal, which I think
everyone agrees that that's the goal,
[SPEAKER_01]: then why shouldn't we value something
that's messy and try to work with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I I totally agree and understand
it is messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even with, you know, my project is
looking at cannabis smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened Pandora's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Box and there's a lot of questions and a
lot of things to be figured out and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the unknown makes people
scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's a thing about
science where scientists are like
[SPEAKER_01]: searching around in the dark underneath
one street lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the universe is this dark,
mysterious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And science just has this like the little
street lamps of technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you imagine every new
technological advance is a new little
[SPEAKER_01]: street lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can kind of like turn on and look
under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us are down on our hands and
knees as scientists with a magnifying
[SPEAKER_01]: glass looking under the street lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone else is like,
well, what if the answer is in the dark?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we we don't have the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that would be I guess this
is like and I would love to have
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions with and I'm sure I will have
many discussions with other scientists on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I've been speaking with a
lot of people on chemo diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people that I talk to,
especially people who have used and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefited from plant medicine,
most of those people who have that and
[SPEAKER_01]: hear what I'm saying about chemo diversity
are just kind of like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi, it has been such a joy to
interview you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your depth and detail of knowledge is like
so liberating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it says in the intro to the
show that we do all of this with good
[SPEAKER_00]: cheer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're such a cheerful and enjoyable
person to chat with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, like I had so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole, you know, half show of
questions that we didn't get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be so kind as to come back again
soon so that we can continue our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love talking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually my it's like extremely
special and narrow interest of mine.
