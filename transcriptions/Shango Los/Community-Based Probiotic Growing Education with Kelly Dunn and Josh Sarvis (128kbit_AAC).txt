[SPEAKER_03]: So Josh and Kelly, I'm really glad that
you took a second to hang out with me You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I got to admit I can fanboy a little
bit because I have been following your
[SPEAKER_03]: work for a while and Through your products
is actually was the first I had thought
[SPEAKER_03]: about amending with all natural
ingredients Back several years ago now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because of that I've known the two of
you as as as living soil Kind of educators
[SPEAKER_03]: right and that you know, they all kind of
come together living soil and permaculture
[SPEAKER_03]: and just general healthy living right and
You know now that I have the opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: to interview people about probiotics and
probiotic growing of cannabis You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what I think is a kind of a new rise
and in probiotics and living soil and KNF
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is taking off everybody wants to
talk about but I don't I don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: depth that you to go back, you know,
you know Decades or maybe more right and
[SPEAKER_03]: so I wanted to get your perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you two seeing?
[SPEAKER_03]: From you know traveling to teach and your
customer feedback and and just what you
[SPEAKER_03]: also get from living I think between
Nelson in Canada and southern Oregon so
[SPEAKER_03]: you get you've got a really good
perspective So so what are you seeing as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as like this what I'm experiencing as
this this this massive increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotic cannabis interest Yeah,
we've been thinking of it is and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it with some colleagues and lady at
Julia skunk magazine is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about it as like a
green rental Renaissance some people like
[SPEAKER_01]: to say the green rush, but it's like not a
rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a it's a Renaissance because in
a way all these years we've been like
[SPEAKER_01]: Myceliating underneath the earth and just
working on our web and our connections and
[SPEAKER_01]: making it all right Make sure we all have
the right food and in a way it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting of all of our knowledge right now
and so we're seeing an amazing amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: farms making the transform the
transformation into natural farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: also we're seeing the system come out with
a lot of Stopping points for pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of testing that's kind of almost
making, you know synthetic growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Dangerous and not you know, you might be
failing products and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I well I also think that you know,
we're we're not believing the myth anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: of big ag of big pharma of big
corporations and we are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: question that and it is giving not only
Educational flow to people but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: freeing them from like these ideas
Ideologies that we used to have and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you know The the growing that
Josh and I have been partaking in for 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years is so in now because it involves
health and it involves like breaking that
[SPEAKER_00]: myth of being taught that only an NPK is
the only way that you can feed your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like touch such a joke as well as
you know a pharmacies are the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can treat your ailments,
so it's been really fantastic seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: people question and I think that you know
once you're given like a really big sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of bad idea Then it's making people
question and people are questioning it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're using into their own gardens
and they're like, oh my god This is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that you know, it's the right
time Also, I also think sorry is that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it's leading by example,
too It's not needing it's not needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: force, you know away on someone or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just saying hey This is the way we're
doing it and it resonates and people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, try the ganja They see the
differences the lab reports everything
[SPEAKER_01]: shows that the natural systems are the
better way to go so the leading by example
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the proof sort of coming out in
the pudding with the laboratories that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of solidifies it that this this is
what's to investing it must feel kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty miraculous to you guys for for do
you know, you know 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: right when you started this and people
were all like, you know NPK synthetics Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you what kind of hippie stuff are
you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now over the course of time I would
think that instead of you trying to push
[SPEAKER_03]: it on others people are coming and not
that you pushed it on us, but you being
[SPEAKER_03]: there Is a resource right instead of that
people are coming to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like please teach me right that must
be kind of astonishing It's really we're
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly humbled by it because you know,
we never put ourselves out there to be You
[SPEAKER_01]: know a leader or an educator It just
became it just became natural and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we felt like we had to
offer and it resonated with people and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're Seeing big changes on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it's it's amazing to see the
growth of it and for us It's the light at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much duality Loom-and-gloom in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things that are just
Vortexing into a dark hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to believe that there is
hope there and it's not just wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe there is hope and and this is the
hope, you know, and so it To have
[SPEAKER_01]: something positive to grab on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the true change comes from
inspiration equals change forcing
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideologies on someone it can create
opposition and that's not resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And I think since we've been doing it
so long, we know that it works And so like
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh said, you know showing people our
flowers or our huge vegetables or you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking soil test samples and just saying
wow We've got everything that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: there in order to grow great crops And
yeah, just so many years into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've had lots of failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had lots of successes We've really
tweaked our recipes and we've come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of our own fermenting that
works for us in our zone in our area and
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of plants can we pull out and
what what can we use in nature or what Can
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow in our own gardens to create that
herbal biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you know If you're nutrient deficient
in a specific nutrient in your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what is it that you can grow to help
bring?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that into your soils and it's
been a lot of trial and error to get to
[SPEAKER_03]: where we are and and that's where the
groundbreaking part comes right because
[SPEAKER_03]: you know a lot of times when this
information is not available because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know when you all started learning this
the Internet didn't make the information
[SPEAKER_03]: possible, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd run into somebody over the course
of moving yourself around the world And
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, oh my gosh this person told
me yeah And then you go and you try it
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself or you know a few seasons every
which way and then now you've got your own
[SPEAKER_03]: best You were inventing your own best
practices and that's a huge deal It is and
[SPEAKER_01]: we have traveled the world quite quite a
lot in our relationship We've been
[SPEAKER_01]: together for 25 years over 25 years now
and we have a 21 year old child and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: traveled the world the whole time We've
done disaster relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked with women and children and
birth We've seen how nutrition affects
[SPEAKER_01]: women Babies and placentas we've seen how
nutrition affects the food which makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: women maybe even they may be eating a lot
But they're malnourished So nutrition and
[SPEAKER_01]: and well-being has been a major part of
our life And so for having it all come
[SPEAKER_01]: together in one kind of modality right now
is incredibly powerful We also know that
[SPEAKER_01]: with you know compounds like Dacamba and
the Defoliating agents that are out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing millions of acres every year
to contaminants We are charged up and
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired like we would almost like give up
sleeping and eating if we had to just To
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to put the message out there that
there is a different way We can survive
[SPEAKER_01]: and thrive on this earth without these
degenerate systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you invest into it Yeah, and to bring
it back to the cannabis industry It really
[SPEAKER_00]: fits into what it is that we're doing
because there's so many people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce their costs in order to stay in
this industry the big corporate guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the big takeovers and They're doing
a lot of NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're bringing down the price per
gram so much that our focus is now on
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers to be able to stay in the
game and Reducing your impact on the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing your impact on how much you're
spending really comes from nature So how
[SPEAKER_00]: can you make stone soup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it really is It's a stone
soup and we came up with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different recipes off of nothing and Josh
was talking about You know going to
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas and opening up clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were having to start clinics with
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: we can take from the area and the region
in the zones that we're in to create
[SPEAKER_00]: something amazing to create a soup that
can nourish and how taking a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Moringa tree and just putting it into hot
water and having them drink Moringa tea
[SPEAKER_01]: can totally change their health and
well-being You know of people it's amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, it's it's a passion So,
um, one of the things that inspired me of
[SPEAKER_03]: y 'all is that you are active educators,
right like you You don't miss an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to both both share your
successes and and how you got there And
[SPEAKER_03]: and so you're speaking all over the place
and for a lot of us, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are learning about Probiotic gardening
in all of its forms online, right,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, you know either
websites or forms like the probiotic
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers alliance on Facebook where people
are coming together to share information
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's awesome, right because we can
wrap it Prototype ideas really fast when
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got when you've got well like like
probiotic farmers alliance 30,000 people
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe maybe that's a little bit too big
But point being a lot of people working
[SPEAKER_03]: together can can hone down a question
really quickly and get to an answer It
[SPEAKER_03]: also in these days when everybody's all
stressed out there's more people flaming
[SPEAKER_03]: each other online and and it's it's
difficult to learn in some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: environments now and and I'm continually
trying to support or you know encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: people to keep teaching each other right
because When when when the internet sites
[SPEAKER_03]: are filled with arguments everybody just
wants to to walk away right and and that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be good sometimes to take a break
from a lot of the political stuff But
[SPEAKER_03]: learning about how to take better care of
ourselves to grow better cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow better food We don't necessarily
really want to take a break from that So I
[SPEAKER_03]: just wanted to hear your thoughts about
you know, the kind of idea of like each
[SPEAKER_03]: one teach one Where where where where
yourselves as leaders thought leaders in
[SPEAKER_03]: the in the probiotic and cannabis growing
community and me because I have you know
[SPEAKER_03]: access to an audience What what are your
thoughts about what everybody should be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing to continually make sure we're
teaching each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's really interesting that
first off what sparks me is that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation even in our language
between the word health and happiness Why
[SPEAKER_00]: is it that health and happiness are two
separate words?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really feel like when we're gaining
Information or we're gaining health
[SPEAKER_00]: through information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's incredibly important
that it also makes you happy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it needs to make you feel good
So the information that we always put out
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that's going to make people
feel good And it's also going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: health So if we didn't separate those two
words of health and happiness and we
[SPEAKER_00]: really might not even be in this
predicament So I really encourage people
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to find education And about
health and well-being through what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you happy if you're seeing something on
the internet, that's not making you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not healthy either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know really be drawn to whatever
makes you feel good and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we we like to draw wisdom from our elders
because you know, we're just one cog in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wheel and you know, we have a lot to
learn still and Bob Snodgrass,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know as a part, you know close family
member of ours and you know his big
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching which I think is a beautiful
thing to say is that He really believes
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a bell curve to Consciousness
and to understanding of things and he you
[SPEAKER_01]: know when he created the glass pipes with
the gold and the silver He created
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was magical and instead of
keeping that secret to himself and making
[SPEAKER_01]: a million dollars and not teaching anyone
at his algebra teacher taught him that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know humanity is Learning at a really slow
rate and as soon as everyone starts
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching each other Consciousness rises
and it rises up and we all grow and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like the hundredth month So we you know,
we've taken that similar type of approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we we are in the middle of our
evolution We're learning and growing as we
[SPEAKER_01]: as we you know as we grow older and we
think that it's really powerful to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to share that message and To not create
divisiveness on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is really a really important thing
You don't have to put out something and
[SPEAKER_01]: react to someone's answer if someone's
gonna come at you or whether they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: troll or whether there's someone that
doesn't Believe in you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's also known as conversation
And if you don't have the right words to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out and prove that what you know,
you're saying is right then hey Challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself find the right the right words,
but don't don't take it as a stifling
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's move forward Let's all share
our information because that's what's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting us where we're going and we're
moving pretty fast right now with our
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and also the Buddhist say I just
love this that there's only two emotions
[SPEAKER_00]: and all emotions are based under these two
and that's love and fear so If there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anger that's coming out on the internet or
something that you feel angry with
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself And there's some kind of a fear
that you really need to address to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: that into love because love is the
happiness Love is the health and love that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we all need to end up So
really encouraging people to go with the
[SPEAKER_00]: love and let go of the fear and then I'd
also like to say, you know That's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why we created the pure
certification which isn't was created
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was no organic certification
and it seemed like there was just product
[SPEAKER_01]: going onto the shelf With no actual,
you know form of accountability,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there was like how do you prove
that that's good?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no system involved So we thought
you know, well the USDA is in the end and
[SPEAKER_01]: modern agriculture has never been
Something to you know to learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many broken things in
there So, you know, we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's different We're gonna say
this is all organic and it meets all the
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA standards by getting toxicity reports
and soil tests and water tests The farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: would do that on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they need to pay someone to do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them what they're doing is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've created a format where it's like
a in each one teach one type of situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where You know, we put a format out and
it's it's a it's a community monitored
[SPEAKER_01]: community supported Certification so we've
said here's all the things that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why closed loops matter because
it's health its well-being you know what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going in your products You there's no
surprises afterwards and it's empowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's empowering to say oh look at that
tree It's filled with calcium or it has
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals because it has really deep
roots, you know part of our traveling was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to Hawaii and learning about natural
farming and a long time ago we learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming and we're living on the
land and we started looking at biodynamics
[SPEAKER_01]: and Rudolph Steiner like oh the horns in
the ground are almost like the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: IMOs and Well, that's pretty cuz people
that are connected to the earth are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the same type of information It
may be a different form a bit from up to
[SPEAKER_01]: that modality of teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never said We're only KNF or we're
only natural farming or we're only
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture or we're only biodynamics
We're all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're humus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pro life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're humus beings We come from the earth
and we take out cigarette butts when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there And also the thing with the
peer certification that Josh didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention that I think is really important
is that there's you know We have over 85
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that are jumping on this because
they were already on that path And maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: people now are saying oh, I want to do
this and now I'm really inspired Through
[SPEAKER_00]: love through health through happiness to
better my practices on my farm So there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people that you know, like us who
have been growing for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: three decades that were like Hey,
I fit right into this I have already been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that and then it starts to create a
higher consciousness and then you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like your bell curve that Josh was talking
about and once you have more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people then it does shoot right up because
everybody is on the same intention and our
[SPEAKER_00]: intention here is healthy pure cannabis
one of the things that I like that you you
[SPEAKER_03]: both espouse is this idea of Sharing all
the information and then letting people
[SPEAKER_03]: choose for themselves And one of the
things that I like is that y'all share
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that's in your products,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in this time where a lot of
people are trying to monetize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah intellectual property, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't let you know my trade secret right
or I have SOPs for extraction,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because our oil looks so good I'm not
gonna tell you right and like I'm I'm you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I don't own this IP I'm all like
alright So so what have you learned from
[SPEAKER_03]: your own example of sharing your inputs
because a lot of people would be afraid to
[SPEAKER_03]: write exactly what's in the product on the
bottle because they're like, oh someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna copy me, but I know that you have
shared your inputs and Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine has thrived So so what's been
your experience with essentially given a
[SPEAKER_03]: given it away and then still being able to
sell your product Well people coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: to us who have used our recipes and given
us flowers that blow me away It's been so
[SPEAKER_00]: totally amazing and then they're just
really excited and they also say My health
[SPEAKER_00]: has also improved my flowers and my
growing has improved and my health is
[SPEAKER_00]: improved and I've gotten off all these
different pharmaceuticals Just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried out your recipe because they trusted
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they knew what was in the You know,
we've done different businesses throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the years and we never felt like someone
taking our idea was I Direct challenge to
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt like we're very innovative people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very charged up We're wanting to
learn all the time if all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: someone all of a sudden 10 companies come
out with a bunch of Micronizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome and everybody sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome Now all of a sudden we got
people all over the place that invented
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a that's a that's a point of it
says it's a compliment Yeah, and so maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to continue to challenge ourselves
To come up with a new innovative product
[SPEAKER_01]: one innovative product may not be enough
for the world to make change So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know dragonfly earth medicine is
unique We recognize, you know that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing everything and and people haven't
taken it and anything if they do they
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they'll just be an imposter that's
trying to do the same thing whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, it really doesn't matter to us because
Just like you know sharing everything if
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more people are doing it It's
just a positive thing to the earth because
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have to be the only one That know
everything we don't want to be that person
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're writing a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been writing a book for like
three years Maybe before now more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: information more and more like,
you know Exciting ideas come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be sharing that and hopefully
people will take it and run with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize it and maybe write a book off of
that and I think shared information is how
[SPEAKER_00]: we can better our Humanity right on well,
thank you both for your leadership and a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of time that you're able to
give me today and and If for anybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: who wants to find their products here at
dragonfly earth medicine calm Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I also have DEM pure farms calm which
highlights the pure certification What a
[SPEAKER_01]: closed-loop system is and all the farms
that are imply implementing these These
[SPEAKER_01]: actions right on cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much Right on You
