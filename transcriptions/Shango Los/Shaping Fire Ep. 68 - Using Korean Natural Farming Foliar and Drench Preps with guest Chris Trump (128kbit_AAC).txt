[SPEAKER_00]: Synergy is something that gets talked
about a lot nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from the Greek word for working
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that a few things can come
together and become something better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual ingredients is something
that can apply to lots of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: sports teams, musical arrangements,
and even natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the right ingredients with the right
attributes come together, wondrous things
[SPEAKER_00]: can happen that we may not have expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes bringing those things together
incorrectly can be bad too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move through our lives, we try to
put together more good synergies than we
[SPEAKER_00]: do bad ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivating cannabis is essentially a
practice in creating good synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to talk about
creating good synergies in Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is a master natural farmer certified
by Master Cho of Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also studied microbial analysis
under Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many consider his YouTube videos
explaining Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques to have been the key to
cannabis wildly increasing popularity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is especially helpful that Chris is a
certified cannabis educator who actually
[SPEAKER_00]: speaks English.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take Chris's courses online at
naturalfarming.co and in person across the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris has been a guest before on episode
35 explaining the basics of KNF and its
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden rise of popularity in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we'll be discussing how to blend KNF
preps in order to use them properly to
[SPEAKER_00]: create synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for having me, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I started studying KNF a few
years ago, I have both made a few
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations and I've actually received a
lot of them from friends too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have enough now that I really
actually need a small fridge to store them
[SPEAKER_00]: in besides my kitchen fridge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means even more though is that
not only do I have ferments, but like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got enough to get myself into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took your nutrition cycle course
online last week, I realized that much of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I thought I knew was actually wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic bro science learning on my part,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by knocking down some of
those misconceptions that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated by well-intentioned people
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that stands out for me is the idea
that KNF preparations should only be used
[SPEAKER_00]: once at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really thought that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you teach about that that you
learned from your teacher, Master Cho?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the preps by themselves are so far
from a balanced nutrient that we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: into trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so with natural farming,
there's not a single thing we use by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a natural farming prep,
you're in need of the complementary
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call the individual preps inputs and the
combination of them solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're never using an input like an FPJ
or an OHN or something by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're blending it into a solution for a
balanced nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: FPJ by itself, for example, probably the
most common one used by itself is
[SPEAKER_02]: imbalanced enough that you're potentially
and likely going to create a bug problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like candy coating or over fattening
your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just asking for critters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's a big deal.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's break out that term balanced
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit at the real basic
level, what is a balanced nutrient versus
[SPEAKER_00]: an imbalanced nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their characteristics and how
will I know the difference when I see
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we use vinegar and kind of as a
base, it's one of the core inputs needed
[SPEAKER_02]: for making anything in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the basic preparation that most
things are kind of added to would be
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar, rice vinegar, preferably,
OHN, oriental herbal nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: and FPJ, fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would mix those to get your
maintenance solution or seed soak
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a video, I think, on YouTube on
seed soak solution or SES.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is kind of your starter,
if you will, you start with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if your plants in need of
nitrogen for vegetative growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're moving into adding, you know,
fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the balance comes in the vinegar,
that pH, that sourness, that acid plays
[SPEAKER_02]: well with this kind of compost extract or
liquid compost that FPJ is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then OHN is this, you know,
we use it so little, there's such a tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the little bits of alcohol in the OHN
actually promote the kind of or foster
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a good reaction in the circulatory
system of a plant, being able to take in
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients like FPJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a nutrient in the rice
vinegar or grain vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nutrients in other vinegars,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have rice vinegar,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that complementary kind of dynamic
that happens in these multiple types of
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs is really what makes this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using any of it by itself,
you're off an experiment land with an
[SPEAKER_02]: untried system and something that none of
us have seen good results from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's kind of like don't bother
making FPJ if you're going to try and use
[SPEAKER_02]: it by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're better off, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, maybe you could mix it in
some water and drench it on the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: with some other things that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, keep it away from
a foliar application by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really like, I don't know,
the level of magnitude that you answered
[SPEAKER_00]: that question in about a balanced
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was, you know, talking to someone
else, let's say a reductionist scientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually hear like, oh,
well, you know, a balanced nutrient is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that has these amino acids and these other
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you put them together,
you get this whole chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, you answered it very much
based on how we're going to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tactically, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all like, okay, well, if you spray
the FPJ on its own, you're spraying sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: all over your plants and you're probably
going to attract bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we balance it with a vinegar,
the vinegar checks the sugars is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming that is the thought behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have made something balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really balanced based on what
is necessarily under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's balanced in how these two solutions
play out in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's one of the things
that I really like about KNF, even though,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you've said many times, how it's taught
in Korea, there's a lot of what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Americans might consider
mysticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's taught by like story almost,
how it is actually used in real life
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of what's happening at the
microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the part I play in this
too, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, you know, scientific papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent, you know, a lot of time just
enjoying and going down the rabbit trails
[SPEAKER_02]: of understanding with the work and the
research people have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of what we are asking nowadays
with the microbiological world hasn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: comprehensively studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's these pieces and bits and
you got to understand one thing to even
[SPEAKER_02]: access another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've really enjoyed the journey of
learning in that way and getting to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of great scientific minds and
people in different universities around
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, though, I kind of think of
myself as a scientist, I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this teaching of this, the
communication of this and the application
[SPEAKER_02]: of this is for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, we can get into the,
you know, the amino acids in or fatty
[SPEAKER_02]: acids in the cell wall tissue of the,
you know, plant that you're FPJing and how
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets pulled out through osmotic
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's these complex nutrients
that are made plant available because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: micronized through that fermentation
process or being broken down into such
[SPEAKER_02]: fine particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really for a farmer, that doesn't
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can with understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so much of what's needed is just
succeeding and using tech that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: proven and being able to apply it
effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely where I focus because
if there's not a billion scientific papers
[SPEAKER_02]: in natural farming in the next 10 years,
I'm okay with that as long as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to take over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in real quality of food and medicine
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, historically, too, one of the
reasons that, you know, lessons of all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds, whether they be like religious
parables or scientific stories of the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of nature between different animal
populations that you get from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, historical farmer anecdotes and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, what we're trying to do is
often package the learning in ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone can understand, because there's
no doubt it's good to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: universities backing up the Korean natural
farming teachings with actual repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: results, scientific results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody who wants to be a
natural farmer is interested in that level
[SPEAKER_00]: of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they are more interested in
knowing what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that, you know,
that storytelling approach or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as we've already said,
balancing the FPJ with some vinegar,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be all somebody needs to know to
be able to feed their family and their
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or make their bottom line work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or make their bottom line work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hit on some specifics for a
moment for the folks who are like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been spraying FPJ on its
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I started making it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to cop to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm going to spray my fermented
plant juice, how much vinegar should I be
[SPEAKER_00]: matching it with so that I get that
balance and I don't turn it into a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: bug attractant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at the very minimum, if you had just
just FPJ, and you're wanting to start
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming, and you didn't have OHN,
you couldn't buy any, and it's three
[SPEAKER_02]: months to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a one to 500 FPJ in water and a
one to 500 vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same amount of vinegar and
FPJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're equal in the solution,
but they're also used at a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A very, very typical American trait is if
I hear that one to 500 is good,
[SPEAKER_02]: then one to 250, double that will be
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am totally that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you go a little deeper into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can such small amounts be so
effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can a difference between one to
500 and one to 250, that small of a
[SPEAKER_00]: change, actually make a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's how we get these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the process to make them that's
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word micronization or micronize,
it's a real word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And microbes are incredibly effective at
micronizing complex nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And big things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of biochemicals that are
really not plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tied up in these long chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And roots don't have the ability to,
nor does the plant tissue surface have the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to break those down or eat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that plastic packaging when they
send you a flash drive and you nearly kill
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself trying to open it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the level of tied up that a lot of
the nutrients in, say, a stick or a blade
[SPEAKER_02]: of grass are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not food to my plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can become food if it's broken down,
if it's composted, or if it sits on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface of the soil and the microbes get
to it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be great nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as they are, they're not plant
available or they're not readily eaten by
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots are able to take in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have minor acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots do for creating space, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can push in between a rock or create
cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for physiological movement,
for physical creating space for their
[SPEAKER_02]: roots to continue to push down,
plants have the ability to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as breaking down what they're
coming in contact with, it's just not
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're doing is you're taking this
really great food, these plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing that are always lush and
green and rich, maybe a wild weed or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, and you're taking it through
fermentation, which causes it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: micronized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that beneficial biochemicals and
mineral content and carbohydrate and then
[SPEAKER_02]: fats and acids that exist in the structure
of that plant become broken apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start to break down these chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, this really full
nutrient, albeit small, we're not using a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot of this, is really available to
a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, if you overdo it,
even a little bit, you can make your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants drunk or loopy or overfed,
too much of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see it in the plant reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made this mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife's grandmother had orchids and she,
sweetest lady, we named one of our kids
[SPEAKER_02]: after her, Ruthie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, she loved her orchids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I brought her over some liquid IMO
that was freshly made, well made,
[SPEAKER_02]: and had all kinds of great nutrients for
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd been using it successfully on
trees and vegetable gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had no worry giving it to Ruthie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, orchids, orchids are far lighter
eaters than so much of what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: encountering in the kind of plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her orchid keeled over like it was
drunk as could be and never recovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't likely fed it poison or gave
it anything that would cause that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was wrong for the plant,
we just gave it too much of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an orchid needed was that normal
dilution I use on plants to be diluted
[SPEAKER_02]: probably a thousand times and just have
this really feather light meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just one of the plant
kingdom's kind of interaction with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these mixes, these recipes,
aren't new.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been around a long time and
they've been played with a lot with plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plant kingdom to come up with the
right ratios for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets into the philosophy of what
we're doing too, which we can go into more
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and finish that thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the philosophy and how does it
play in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's the right amount of
nutrition at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of core to the the nutritive
cycle theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say theory because though it's been
used all over the world on many different
[SPEAKER_02]: crops, there's still more to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I give out a handout kind of laying
out what a potential feeding program would
[SPEAKER_02]: be for a crop, I give rice because I was
taught with rice because that's a very
[SPEAKER_02]: Korean crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow it all over and it's really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drive down the highway in Korea and
the medians and there's little triangles
[SPEAKER_02]: in between overpasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're full of solid, beautiful,
full heads of rice that somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really neat and I think we could
definitely learn something from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's this kind of concept that,
you know, and again, back to story time,
[SPEAKER_02]: we teach it when we teach this and we're
introducing kind of a new mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will, to what we're talking about,
because it's so foreign to how we do
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture currently or kind of our
traditional conventional agriculture in
[SPEAKER_02]: the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use human life cycle to kind of talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, a newborn baby,
you know, what, what is the first,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if it's, you know, getting its
food from mom, what's the first food it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought you were being rhetorical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mother's milk, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother's milk, but not the mother's milk
will get for the rest of its, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: breastfeeding journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a very different first meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: A baby gets something called colostrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a mineral rich, low nutrient
kind of meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have all the fats and proteins
of mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has very little of that and it's full
of mineral, you know, kind of minor
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that the child will use to kind
of do brain development and get its
[SPEAKER_02]: systems going in a new way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when we take a seedling,
you know, where it's barely popped its
[SPEAKER_02]: first true leaf, and we're feeding it,
you know, with the big guns, we're giving
[SPEAKER_02]: the wrong level of nutrient to that plant
will actually stump the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done side by side trials on
this, where, you know, you think,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, feeding it a ton as soon as it pops is
the best way to get it to rush towards
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've proven out that it's not you're
actually stunting your potential growth by
[SPEAKER_02]: overfeeding a seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I teach that all we're putting on
in the beginning of a plant's life is
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance solution, just that tiny bit
of nutrient that comes from the FPJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're giving them that that kind of
mineral and balanced nutrient of that
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar, OHM, FPJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm hearing, and please do correct
me if I'm not understanding, how I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding this is that going back to
your example of a stick, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, the nutrition in this stick,
there is nutrition in this stick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all, you know, hard into this stick,
just like trying to open packaging from
[SPEAKER_00]: Best Buy or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas what the KNF prep is, is the
removing of all of that packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gets us down to the essential life
force nutrition of whatever it is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are fermenting or breaking down,
which kind of makes it like a super potent
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, I don't want to say the
soul of the plant, but it's most essential
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritive part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're suggesting that the reason
why one to 500 or one to 1000 is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate is because it's so out of,
it's so out of my US farming experience
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're used to adding volumes of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, the Korean technique is actually
reductive in the other direction where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're removing everything that may not
be necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through the fermentation
incubating the most essential nutrition to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got only the part we need and
it's incubated to be super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's so reactive that we
actually have to be really careful with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can be very impactful on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I getting it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me, let me re say that to you though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so in conventional agriculture,
if I buy for my orchard, say a 30,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 30, um, nutrient NPK nutrient,
um, you know, just a chemical fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: I apply that expecting, and this is very
common and hoping that I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: about a 20% uptake in my crop this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning I will benefit from that
application at about 20% of the poundage I
[SPEAKER_02]: apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I apply a pound, I'm getting one
20th or one fifth of that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, um, kind of in my crop or in
production this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's, that's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might not be common knowledge,
but that's, that's normal in conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're looking for hopefully getting
about a 20% uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because the rest of it goes into
the soil, um, becomes locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's how we get hard pans is they go
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes down about 12 inches, 18 inches,
and just sits there waiting to be made
[SPEAKER_02]: plant available by, um, microbes because
even 30, 30, 30 isn't really plant
[SPEAKER_02]: available unless it gets broken down to
some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, chemical fertilizer still needs
the microbiological world to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: The less alive your soil is, the less of
that, you know, total poundage applied is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to become plant available this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the converse or, you know, alternately
in, in natural farming, we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, fully available, so available that we
can apply foliarly and it's taken in
[SPEAKER_02]: through the leaf, um, tissue where the
plant can actually absorb it through its,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, leaves and in a really effective way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of like, um, it's,
it's kind of like mainlining nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for the, you know, crass
reference, but it's, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like putting IV where it's going
right into the system rather than,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, needing to be digested before
you get access to those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffering through the
rhizosphere and the roots and coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that kind of just buffering and
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going right to the underside of
the, the leaves where it just like sucks
[SPEAKER_00]: it right in and boom, then now it's in
the, now it's interior.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see, you'll see results in 24
hours, 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see those plants react to that
nutrient or in less time sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, let's talk about the size of,
of the, the nutrients at this one to 1,001
[SPEAKER_00]: to 500 or so, um, in your, in your earlier
example, you were saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the roots interact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've, I've only known you to teach
foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is, would we ever use these,
um, these preps as a, as a soil drench as
[SPEAKER_00]: well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I know some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, I, I've only ever really used it
as a foliar except for occasionally I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit, you know, left in the,
in the bottle and I'll pour it on a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which is probably not a good idea
now that I've heard what you just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, um, um, so if, if, if these are
the ratios for foliar, are they the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios for a drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do a root drench,
you know, generally, I mean, by the word
[SPEAKER_00]: drench, you're going to use a lot more,
um, you know, material water when you pour
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, whereas when you foliar it's,
you know, it's generally pretty light
[SPEAKER_00]: because even, even though some products
specifically call for you to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the plant so wet that it drips most of
the time, that's not what we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so what is the, is there any
difference in the ratios for a drench
[SPEAKER_00]: approach than there is from a foliar
approach?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question,
Shingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, just starting,
I guess, and from the beginning and
[SPEAKER_02]: starting at the back with cannabis
community and, and with your crop that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, we don't recommend foliar in
flower, um, maybe in the first couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then we're, everything goes to
root drench throughout the flower cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because, um, you don't want to,
um, bring in additional microbial life and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to affect flavor,
um, in, in any way, um, negatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, yeah, everything's soil drench
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and in soil drench, you don't really
change the recipe at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you can use more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also speaking of foliar, um,
when I talk about a foliar application,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are wanting them to get to the point
where they're just barely dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you're also, um, I call it
treating the whole acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where I'm spraying the, the stem,
the leaves to the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way down to the whole surface of
the soil around the drip line of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole area is getting, um,
fed, not just, you know, uh, a few,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, fan leaves or water leaves,
uh, on their underside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get kind of the tip of the
plan all the way to the, the kind of root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, the feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root zone around the drip line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's interesting that you would,
I mean, cause I know that we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should not be spraying foliar on the
evolving flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to, uh, add any taste to the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also don't want to spike unexpected
microbe activity either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I got that, but for me,
I usually just tapered off my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my KNF after week two and just generally
went without it in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, well, clearly I'm doing it
wrong, but, but, you know, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what happens when, you know,
I learned things a little bit here and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus taking a course that is integrative
and putting it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but luckily, you know, I get a chance
to talk with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, so how, what volume, um,
am I going to be at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So after week two, when I have switched
these same, same preps to a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: a drench, how much, uh, of the water with
the, the preparations in it, should I be
[SPEAKER_00]: using, for example, you know, when I make
my compost tea, I get myself a big old
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and I get a, uh, you know,
I've got this, uh, this, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this mug that's about the size of like,
you know, one of those red party cups and
[SPEAKER_00]: I go down the line and I put a,
I put a cup in each one, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I, at least if it feels
like, okay, I'm not adding too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not adding too little and,
and I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, you know, occasionally, maybe,
maybe twice a week with compost tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with something as powerful as these
can F preps, um, you know, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether a cup would still be
appropriate or if it should be waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, way lesser amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just water it in with raw
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, good, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this is, this is kind of a hard,
hard one, um, for people to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I just encourage,
try it once on, you know, this actual
[SPEAKER_02]: protocol that I'm going to go over,
try it once on a couple plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: do a side by side, because I'm going to
tell you this really small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the, you know, the typical
American mindset is, well, if he said that
[SPEAKER_02]: amount and I double it, I should get
double results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna, I'll lay it out and,
uh, and just encourage a trial,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because it's, it sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have so much empathy for how some of
this sounds on first hearing because I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew up, you know, son of conventional
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up, uh, you know, conventional
organic, where you still are aiming at all
[SPEAKER_02]: those NPK numbers and trying to,
to get your soil and tissue tests to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, be corrected by all the inputs
you're putting on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, this just isn't the
case in, in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what we're chasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I do want to caveat before I go
into this though, that natural farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and, and I've, I've felt the need to
repeat this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if, uh, this has been said before
somebody's heard this, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I feel like it's the, it's the
necessary thing to kind of correct maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the, the skewed, the skewed science
that happens on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, 80% of natural farming is the IMO,
um, process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So IMO four applied a week before planting
and mulched and watered in is 80% of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you need from the natural farming program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're not doing that, then you can
still play with the 20%, but just know
[SPEAKER_02]: that that is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because what's happening is so much of
the soil nutrition is getting cycled into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants kind of feeding program because
the microbes are breaking down sand,
[SPEAKER_02]: silt and clay and making that plant
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that silica, everybody's chasing
silica in, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, if you have sand in your soil and
fungi to eat it, like you don't see silica
[SPEAKER_02]: issues or, or need, um, silica because
there's plenty of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not plant available unless you
have the fungi that can eat sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw away all my microscope slides and
never clean them because I deal so much
[SPEAKER_02]: with fungi that even if I wash them with
alcohol, uh, I come back to use them a
[SPEAKER_02]: week later and they're all etched because
the fungi has eaten the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's IMO is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little plug there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're talking about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, the protocol for natural
farming is that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the right amount of nutrients are
talking about that and then at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so one of the things kind of
people, um, get wrong is they just put it
[SPEAKER_02]: on all the time every day or every two
days and really we're putting on,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, once, uh, really twice a week or every
other week, sorry, every other week we're
[SPEAKER_02]: applying nutrients and sometimes every
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, that's really, you know,
that's really strange to people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: used to feeding all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have IMOs in process in your
system, um, then the, the nutrient is like
[SPEAKER_02]: this little bit of an encouragement and,
uh, and, uh, kind of production booster,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in your kind of whole system you got
going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, um, if I was in flower and
I wanted to feed every week, I would apply
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance solution every other week and
a targeted feeding solution, the
[SPEAKER_02]: alternating weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maintenance solution is that really
simple recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: FPJ one to 500 brown rice vinegar or just
rice vinegar one to 500 and OHN one to a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand really simple nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would go on once a week or once,
uh, every other week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would watch my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if I'm thinking they need some
nitrogen and, uh, but maybe some
[SPEAKER_02]: background calcium and some background
potassium, then I would do my maintenance
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: FPJ, OHN vinegar, and I would add in some
fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the main need is, man, these,
these girls need to be fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would put a one to a thousand,
which is the full strength of FAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'm like, and I think they could
use some balancing still, or I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: help them a little bit put on structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would bring in a one to 2000 half
strength WCA, which is a calcium and then
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically cannabis and flower really
benefits from a prep called WSK water
[SPEAKER_02]: soluble potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so I'd bring that in at one to
2000 and that would be my soil drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't, I would be liberal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I might do a whole watering with
the, the liquid or half a watering and
[SPEAKER_02]: then a flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was for the gating, um, and,
um, and because of the amounts,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's in balance and it'll work
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I'm also not doing that every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not creating this glut of nutrients in
my soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm putting a little bit on,
it'll, it'll kind of ramp up or activate
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil microbial life as well as give a
ton of great nutrition to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's highly available for them to take
up through all the feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an example of how you
might go about, um, following the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, does that mean you can't also
increase that interval or, or decrease
[SPEAKER_02]: that interval to, you know, every,
you know, every four days you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would just, um, be aware that you
might get the same results by doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, because of how these nutrients
work and how easily, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are to, to, for a plant to kind of
digest or, or take into their systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so that additional applications might
just be spending you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you spending time and money you don't need
to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the idea of, of, of taking the,
um, um, the maintenance, uh, formula and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it at dilutions and then just do a
full watering with that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, one part of me is like,
ah, I might be adding too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the other part of me is going,
well, you know, they're at such low
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's kind of like just
taking water with like a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, it's, you want a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and you want a lot of water so
that it can reach all the parts of the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't just sit on top,
but at the same time, the, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the water is such that, um,
that you don't really have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what most of us think about is
burning our roots, which I actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: your idea of, of getting the plants drunk
a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so, uh, we've had quite a long
first set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and, uh, take our first
break and then come back and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about OHN next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is natural farming educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the National Hemp Program in flux due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother Seth and Eric Crawford continue to
release seeds to hemp farmers that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: legal, no matter how you grow them or when
you test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV while always staying
below the 0.3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to refuse outside investment
that would change their company culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_00]: program, and their minimum starting wage
is 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars in the hemp market,
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics,
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive in past testing, check out
OregonCBDseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OregonCBDseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side by sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_00]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco Endomycorrhizal Inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding, healthy plants without
using excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought those cheap lights online,
and they're difficult to work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: fail in no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is IP 66 wet rated, so a little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the most important aspect,
it is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_00]: want for great-yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look badass too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to judge on PAR photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth, while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior PAR efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love their attentiveness to even
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: how this strategy can work for you.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shangolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our guest this week is natural farming
educator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of this set, we're going to be
talking about OHN, Oriental Herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do that, there's one thing I
want to hit on the foliar with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the reasons that I'm
always tempted to add extra KNF prep to
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is because when I look at how
small of a mount that I'm adding to my
[SPEAKER_00]: five liter sprayer, I'm thinking to
myself, how is this going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: how is this going to become ubiquitous in
the sprayer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some amount, let alone equal amounts,
but how will some amount get on all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm thinking to myself,
well, if I add some more, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood that every plant will get some.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that taught in Korean natural
farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what from that perspective ensures
that all of the plants are going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the nutrition out of the foliar
sprayer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so fun, fun phenomenon, natural law
osmosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you throw it in there and let it sit
for 30 minutes and give it a swirl,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll have a much easier time being very
evenly distributed in solution than if you
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it in there, shake it once and start
spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're really concerned then give it
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is those vacuums of water
that are looking for chemical bonds will
[SPEAKER_02]: yank on all that stuff and evenly
distribute it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the places that are higher
concentration, the additions you added
[SPEAKER_02]: will move to places of lower concentration
naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then giving it a shake, it works even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a shake plus a little bit of
sitting time would probably be the- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use a 10 liter sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't add more in ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't double the amount you put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to spray more to make sure
it gets everywhere, that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very strange because I'm sure
that a lot of people are like me where
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get the KNF, I'm thinking about
ratios for like compost tea, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going from a ratio of one to two,
one to three, one to four, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of compost tea, all the way to
one to a thousand, it's all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait, is this a typo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hitting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't thought about osmosis like that
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about OHN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking during the first set
about how all of these different KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations are never used alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of goes double so for OHN
because OHN is a blend of five herbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then even OHN you don't use by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you explain the underlying
principle at play justifying using OHN as
[SPEAKER_00]: a foliar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm looking for is both an
explanation of what OHN is and why those
[SPEAKER_00]: five work together so magically when used
as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OHN is a combination of herbs that no
matter who you're talking to in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific world, the herbs that we use
are understood to be kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're immune boosting or disease
suppressing herbs no matter how you look
[SPEAKER_02]: at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the components they have have
that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OHN really in natural farming is a
health tonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically, there's a lot of health
things, plant health, animal health we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in natural farming, but OHN is
specifically targeted to plant and animal
[SPEAKER_02]: immune system and immune support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a prebiotic, if you will,
a nutrient to support the overall kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: health and immune system of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology component comes from 500
year old Chinese traditional medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: recipes where good science was done before
we had our big universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was done by people with using
observation and experimentation over
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science is the study of nature through
observation and experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the definition of science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get this pass down of something
that works and has worked for a really
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're beginning to understand some of
these complex biochemicals and their
[SPEAKER_02]: subtle interactions with the human body or
the plant and animal kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're kind of limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of the best I can do to deep dive
into what the herbs are in natural farming
[SPEAKER_02]: if we really want to get into it and why
would be to step over into a traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese medicine explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be helpful, Shingar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be getting ready for this,
but I encourage you to just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: name the five too, because I'm sure
there's lots of folks listening who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know all five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why don't we start there and then
go into the Chinese medicine, which I also
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have a video on YouTube on how to
make this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will admit, I've watched my own
video when I've forgotten a step or just
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten my wires crossed on what I'm doing
next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no shame in watching a video while you
make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so in making OHN, we are
fermenting five herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fermentation, like we talked about
earlier, micronizes or kind of breaks down
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the cell walls of these herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the five herbs are cinnamon,
ginger, garlic, licorice root,
[SPEAKER_02]: and angelica root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use two parts of the angelica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cinnamon specifically is cassia
cinnamon, not those real thin cinnamon
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks that have those kind of spiral of
real thin flesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want the cinnamon bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a much thicker thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then angelica, generally we're using
sinensis or gigus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other varieties that work
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the ones I recommend most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then licorice, we're using the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they're pre-fermented and then
tinctured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tincture is a high alcohol,
30% alcohol minimum to pull it into
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a little different from the
typical preps in natural farming where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're fermenting and just really want what
comes out in fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, we're kind of yanking on the essence
or these kind of prebiotic or immune
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting components of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're yanking kind of all of it out in
the tincturing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy making OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: But traditional Chinese medicine is kind
of where we get some of the explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to thank my friend,
Jay, I am not a traditional Chinese
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine practitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've talked to a few people that are
over the years, my friend Yuki in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend Jay's wife is actually a
practitioner of traditional Chinese
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's touched by cannabis, I think is
Jay's handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But her explanation for me, I was asking,
or about it actually just this last month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll go ahead and read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinnamon is a warming herb in Chinese
medicine meant to warm the channels and
[SPEAKER_02]: increase kidney key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ginger, fresh, is warming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry ginger is hot in nature and used to
tonify digestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garlic is warming and used for parasites,
cough, and colds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Licorice is a neutral herb used in most
formulas to tonify other herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angelica is warming and used for women's
issues, cold, flush, and damp condition,
[SPEAKER_02]: to flush damp conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are all anthelmintic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I said that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, if that was too much or
overly technical, these are things that
[SPEAKER_02]: support immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we all drink some lemon tea with
honey when we got a cold and we get that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of soothing effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because that vitamin C and the
things in honey actually are good for our
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these ones are specifically for a
continual kind of aid to overall health,
[SPEAKER_02]: continual aid to fight off disease,
but not in the way in that these directly
[SPEAKER_02]: attack disease or are their own sword and
shield against disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are preventing disease in that they
are making healthier the plant or animal
[SPEAKER_02]: and so that they aren't susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful to have had the
opportunity to data gal who was an
[SPEAKER_00]: acupuncturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hearing you describe it from the
Chinese medicine direction, she would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, these are all herbs that create
movement, are warming, and increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system because those flavors all
tend to work really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like how you said that these are
not aggressive herbs that go and attack
[SPEAKER_00]: pests or disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually fortifying and help you
build up your personal chi, your strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: your core essence or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never really thought about those
working in plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though to a lot of people who are
new to, like you were saying, the
[SPEAKER_00]: storytelling nature of oriental medicine,
just because they talk about it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way doesn't make it any less
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we get into a little
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say, oh, white lab coat and peer review
studies is the only source of true
[SPEAKER_02]: information or explanation of natural law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand so little in that forum,
especially when we're talking about soil
[SPEAKER_02]: life and complex or diversity in
microbiological communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just scratching the surface in that
forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do need to keep paying attention to
the... Well, I guess I like to say we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep humble in just how complex nature
is and that we are as a scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: community moving towards understanding it,
but we are by no means cresting the hill
[SPEAKER_02]: of understanding how this all works in
conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though there is a lot more to the
human experience than lab coats and
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, there's no doubt that oriental
medicine has been proven out in
[SPEAKER_00]: universities and medical research as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that came after the storytelling
did when people had been trying this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's circle back to the original
question, which was we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the blending of these different KNF
preparations and we know why we blend the
[SPEAKER_00]: OHN inputs so that they've got this
warming movement and immune building
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you said even OHN is not used alone,
which is funny because it's already got
[SPEAKER_00]: five things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we want to blend our OHN with
when we apply it either as a foliar or as
[SPEAKER_00]: a root drench?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, broken record Chris over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That base... It's kind of like we're
making a pizza and for my six year old,
[SPEAKER_02]: he wants anchovies and my nine year old,
she wants tomatoes or olives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to have the crust, the cheese and
the sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can coat with the things
that best feed them from my condiment
[SPEAKER_02]: tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can put whatever they want on there,
but we're not making pizza without the
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce, the crust and the cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the sauce and the crust and the
cheese of natural farming is FPJ,
[SPEAKER_02]: OHN and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those stay together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They stick together like sauce,
crust and cheese on pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are always in combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OHN is never used in natural farming
aside from those other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maintenance solution is your base and
then you can add per the plant's nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they need to eat, they're hungry,
they're growing teenager, they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative growth and they just need to be
given as much food as they can,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're using fish amino acid and
you're putting that in with that base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the anchovies, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but they're all a few times
where we're doing something with OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we make FAA, we put a tiny bit of OHN
in with IMO and that gets no FPJ or
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are these few, but as far as like
really feeding the plants or even feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: animals, because you can use OHN in like
baby chick water or full grown chicken
[SPEAKER_02]: water or cattle or pig water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's used in combination with those
other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vinegar and FPJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're here real quick, what's the
ratio of OHN into livestock water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have that all off the top of my head?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that OHN is one to 700.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, is it a baby chick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a full grown chick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a pig or a cow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a little bit more than plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one to 700 OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in similar ratio, you increase
the FPJ and vinegar also.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I probably have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for bees even, you can get of OHN
and LAB and FPJ and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, we're giving it
other than baby chicks, we're giving it as
[SPEAKER_02]: an optional drink aside next to water so
that they have the option to drink this
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient rich solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, next to the water that's always
available so that they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as it's kind of like a mineral lick almost
for cattle, if you're familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll put out a salt or complex mineral
block and cows will go drink some water
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll lick this salt cube for a
minute and they'll go off and go about
[SPEAKER_02]: their day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of how the natural
farming inputs are used in livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to get us to get too
far afield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say we can go a little ways
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I mean, we should pick up on
that another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So circling back to OHN, so now that we
know what's in it and what we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: blend it with to spray, I'm curious when,
you know, after we've made the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs for OHN, do you normally store your
inputs separately and mix it up fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you're about to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you go ahead and mix it into the OHN
and, you know, just put it away pre-made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so OHN's always stored separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make as much as you need for like
a year or six months, which is generally
[SPEAKER_02]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a six month amount for what I
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: But typically I'm, yeah, it's for storage,
for long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the cool things about
OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it gets better with age.
[SPEAKER_02]: It continues to micronize in storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of gets more and more in
solution, if you will, or small particles
[SPEAKER_02]: while it sits there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that increases its effectiveness,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OHN that's been sitting for three
years, we consider twice as effective as
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of how well it's taken in or
absorbed by the plant or animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so actually, if you have three year
old OHN, we reduce the application rate by
[SPEAKER_02]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of one to a thousand, it becomes
one to two thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always encouraging people that are
really, they're getting serious about
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming and they're going to go on
their natural farming journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say make a five year batch of OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because just by making it enough to last
you five years, you've nearly halved the
[SPEAKER_02]: cost of it for your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're buying your inputs at
scale, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because you're by year three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because it gets stronger and more
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: By year three, you're using half the
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by not making only enough for a year,
you effectively are making your same
[SPEAKER_02]: materials go farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please resolve these two things you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said we store the stuff separate and
then we only want to mix enough for six
[SPEAKER_00]: months to a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're saying three and five year
old OHN totally kicks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you resolve those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OHN is the combination of the herb,
of the six parts or five parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just double angelica.
[SPEAKER_02]: OHN is combining them all, but they still
age really well and age better separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my six containers or my five
containers and a double large container
[SPEAKER_02]: are all sitting there separately aging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can make three year old OHN if
they've been sitting there separately
[SPEAKER_02]: aging and I mix all those parts to make
OHN.
[SPEAKER_02]: My OHN is three years old, but I'm just
mixing it fresh for use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got multiple bottles that are three
years old and then you blend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't that when you say that they
evolve, you don't mean that they evolve in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one is evolving in its own jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they continue to kind of break down
or become more available in their own jars
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we still mix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those five containers sitting on the
shelf or six containers sitting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf are aging appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that your water that keeps on jingling
or do you have a bell on you, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the ice in my water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably shaking it subconsciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who's got headphones on,
it's probably really getting to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said when we spray the OHN,
we want to spray it with brown rice
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said there are some other types of
vinegars that might work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the vinegar that I've got is a
bamboo vinegar and I like it and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why does Korean Natural Farming
default towards rice vinegar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that because rice vinegar is
particularly attractive for some reason or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it because we're trying to avoid cheap
crappy vinegar made out of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question, Shango.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pH balancing effect for like liquid
IMO or these different preps is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: universal for vinegars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're getting that balancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some apple cider vinegar or
your bamboo vinegar, it works and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: use that and you should feel like you're
doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not cutting the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, grain vinegar has a different mix
of nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't typically think of vinegar as a
nutrient source.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think of it just as some acidic liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is it has specific
biochemicals and nutrients based on what
[SPEAKER_02]: it was made out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your body is being fed by your
consumption of whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that really wonderful vinegar from
Modaea in Italy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Balsamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So balsamic or red wine vinegar,
you're getting the nutrients from grapes
[SPEAKER_02]: or from whatever they're making it out of,
bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: With grain, there's all this plant
proteins, especially with rice and fats
[SPEAKER_02]: that are getting broken down in the
process of making that vinegar and those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients stay present in that vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, specifically with rice
vinegar and grain vinegars is they have,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they're an acid, they are said
to have an alkalizing or a balancing
[SPEAKER_02]: effect in their nutritional profile when
used or when consumed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of nuanced effect is what we're
going for in the rice vinegar and why we
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to say brown on the rice
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can just say rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more detail on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Korea, they're really, really into
their brown rice vinegar creation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legit Korean brown rice vinegar,
you're probably going to pay a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more for it if you find it, but that is
kind of made at this artisan standard in
[SPEAKER_02]: the process and how they go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely, all of these are not the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they make that and what you're
getting as a result is pretty different
[SPEAKER_02]: from your typical vinegar creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one you want to stay away from,
shango, is a white vinegar where you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know the fruit that went into it because
there is a vinegar process that's derived
[SPEAKER_02]: from petroleum where they make an ethanol
alcohol and turn it into vinegar and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a shortcut vinegar and the nutrients
aren't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually how Monsanto started.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a vinegar company and they came
up with a shortcut in the vinegar making
[SPEAKER_02]: process that is called the Monsanto
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me, it's kind of like whole
plant vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something authentic and true to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our second
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we come back, we're going to be
talking about germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is natural farming educator,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_00]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert so
it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a coco coir blend and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-I-T-T-M-O-S-S.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many, transitioning to organic
gardening can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much to learn about soil
biology and fermentation.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is natural farming
educator, Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, you alluded to it earlier in
first set, but one of the things that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: most interested in now is the particular K
&F preparation that is used to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have got so much value in our
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get as good as germination
ratio as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many of us, we're using seeds that
are several years to potentially decades
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that they can use all the
support they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the show, you were talking
about the nutritive cycle and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to humans where really fresh
babies get the claustrum and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're starting out with very
simple mashed foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through life, the food that we
eat we have changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is true for germinating seeds
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you lay it out for us please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it's actually, it's a
wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you have so much value
in your seeds and maybe their kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to germinate if they're 10 years
old is reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the natural farming prep for popping
seeds is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's inside by sides, the effect of
giving them this minor nutrient in while
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in seed form persists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will have a more vibrant plant with
no other changes just by giving them this
[SPEAKER_02]: seed nutrient to get them to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done that out in side by side
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy Kornberg did a cool side by side
trial with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did it on multiple plants where
she popped them with and without seed soak
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had lifelong or the whole life of
the plant effect from just that one step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything else was kept the same
and she photographed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tracked the growth throughout their
whole journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But others have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so the prep, which in this
conversation, you're gonna get tired of me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it, but it's just those three.
[SPEAKER_02]: That base nutrient that we use in natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: SPJ, one to 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown rice vinegar, vinegar, one to 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OHN, one to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you wanna do is soak them for
anywhere from an hour to 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are soaking them 10 hours,
just be aware they might be popping in
[SPEAKER_02]: that cup because it really does speed up
that germination time as well as increase
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of vitality in the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you did nothing else with
natural farming other than popped your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds with seed soak solution,
I think you'd get a real boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pictures that I've seen from,
after you mentioned seed soak solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days ago when we talked,
I went in the head and I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the side by side pictures
people showed were really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally a seed will soak in just plain
water and you'll get a tail and you move
[SPEAKER_00]: it over to soil or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that were in seed soak
solution, yeah, they threw the tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've already got hairs coming out
the side and they're all rambunctious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hell yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it doesn't just feed the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are farming and living soil,
you're also sending your kid to school
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bag full of cookies to share with
his friends or her friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like giving them some social
boosts in their root zone to make those
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships that will be lifelong
symbiotic relationships with the microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: world in their root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a pretty big deal and really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a little bit of a pain to deal
with wet seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you soak them a short time
before they pop, but you have some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: auto seeder or something, you can soak
them and then let them kind of just barely
[SPEAKER_02]: dry or dry enough that they function as a
dry seed for like an auto seeder and still
[SPEAKER_02]: get the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously if you let them soak until
the tails pop, you don't want to dry them
[SPEAKER_02]: back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a pretty simple process and
it's good for tree saplings all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: down to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that idea of kind of
banking some of those nutrients for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, sending the kid to
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the idea behind that anecdote that
if the seed is soaked in seed soaked
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and those nutrients that are in
that solution are binding or even just
[SPEAKER_00]: statically clinging to the root tail to
become taproot, that when you put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, that seed is already bringing
nutrients to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the same way that we've got an
adult plant that is trading incoming
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition from the microbes in exchange
for giving exudates to everybody living in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere, is it that same kind of
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like even this young this young tail
of the seed is coming to the soil packed
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the nutrients from the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just jump starts that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you explained you said that really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just what's clinging to the
root, it's actually been absorbed into the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has that as a kind of strength,
almost like it has extra to share from the
[SPEAKER_02]: get go rather than being super needy from
the get go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that can really jumpstart that
whole relationship and the rise of fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being that person who shows up
to the party with like, like, like booze
[SPEAKER_00]: and beverage and food and they walk in the
door with their arms full and everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, they're here, you know,
and yeah, I can see how the how the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: would welcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to wanted to hit on that
germination thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next thing, let's talk about
the massive popularity of fermented fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: juice versus fermented plant juice,
because a lot of people tend to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, think that these two different
preparations work equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we know that they work differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's confusion because
there's so many contrasting opinions
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if and if the bro science is teaching
both, I know that that there must be more
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so would you clarify for us when to use
fermented plant juice versus when to use
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented fruit juice?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Shango, this is one of those
questions that I just don't share with
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's behind the behind the paywall and you
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is the the Korean
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really sharing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't this doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get anybody gets any
question answered in this whole kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: realm of tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what what I do find,
though, is when you're just starting out,
[SPEAKER_02]: the questions are really similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of the same questions and
they're in the basic understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as people get a little more into
it, they start to understand kind of how
[SPEAKER_02]: it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the questions change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have a lot of past students that
are, you know, what they asked when they
[SPEAKER_02]: first learned this versus what they're
asking now three, four years later is
[SPEAKER_02]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm able to give the nuance and the
the details of the information where it
[SPEAKER_02]: just wouldn't be understood initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, it's it is it's a bit of a
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's that you kind of need to
travel down a little bit before you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that that next bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Master Cho, when he teaches right now,
you sit with him and there's so much good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and what he has to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're just beginning and trying to
understand what natural farming is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting almost nothing out of the
conversation because it requires a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of base understanding for for some of
the philosophies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what not to be understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not it's not cultish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, you don't you don't
start at a, you know, a doctorate program
[SPEAKER_02]: when you go to college because there's
there's a bit of a journey to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: how everything connects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, I yeah, you always get the answers
if you ask, unless it's like a six hour
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation to get you all the dots
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so when do we choose to use fermented
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so fermented fruit juice,
believe it or not, even though it's highly
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about in the Internet or on the
Internet is is very limited in its uses in
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really only use fermented fruit juice
in some livestock feed preparations and
[SPEAKER_02]: then just in ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the last, you know, three,
four weeks, of a plant's life would
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented fruit juice be a valid nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you were doing canna,
for example, and you were soil drenching,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could bring in a fermented fruit juice
there at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would also add in one to 30
seawater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the enzymatic profile of ripe
fruit compared to unripe fruit or plant
[SPEAKER_02]: material is totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it's telling the plant to do
as far as what to do with with sugars that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have built up, et cetera,
is very different when you apply a
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented plant juice versus a fermented
fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're applying fermented fruit
juice, well, it's in vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is not the right signals for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those those those enzymes, the way they're
expressed in a ripe fruit is is such that
[SPEAKER_02]: you really don't want that as a nutrient
in your kind of early growth or vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: growth or even early fruiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that right as it's ripening off
or finishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so that's maybe one or two
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's and it would be it would be
in the soil, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for cannabis, it would be for an
apple or, you know, or pears or you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripening solution has a really important
or can have a really important role like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get all these tomatoes in
the peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right as the weather starts
cooling down, they got all these green
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes on the plant and they want them
to ripen before kind of the season's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great time for ripening solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be applied foliarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to kind of boost,
boost those tomatoes right over the hump
[SPEAKER_02]: to get some more ripe fruit before they
kind of pitter out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so fermented fruit juice is
important in natural farming, but not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily in the importance as as people
talk about it on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for folks who live, you know,
in sub optimum cannabis growing areas like
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live on Vashon Island in
Washington state, where we have got
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter summers that are not as warm as,
say, California, would it be a good tool
[SPEAKER_00]: in my toolbox to use fermented fruit juice
there after, say, week four to hurry up
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Process process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have that ability?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't you can't change the
cycle of a plant with fermented fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you can, you know,
tell it to finish now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still going to have that that
genetic predisposition to going through
[SPEAKER_02]: its cycle in the way that it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can help with kind of that
finishing off and give it some signal
[SPEAKER_02]: signals on which biochemicals to be
working on as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative or kind of photosynthesis type
processes and structure in comparison to
[SPEAKER_02]: like fruit or flower finishing structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I think it could be useful
in soil drench as you're approaching,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, once you get within four weeks
of harvest or three weeks of harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how long your cycle is,
it could be a great thing for soil drench,
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, since you brought up the
seasonality of your area, don't be tempted
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, the snows on the ground or,
you know, it's cold and so you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: access to fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go down to your local supermarket
and buy fruit to make FFJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to keep on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so I get a lot of questions on
the internet and I try and answer as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when they're, you know,
questions where people have spent zero
[SPEAKER_02]: time kind of learning the basics and they
want, you know, to understand how it all
[SPEAKER_02]: goes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that'll be a couple pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally I'll answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things I get all the time
is pictures of FPJ with all this weird
[SPEAKER_02]: green mold all over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that and I say, oh, you're
making fermented fruit juice with bananas
[SPEAKER_02]: and you live in Michigan and it's
November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd you get your bananas?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, without fail, that's them,
you know, going down to their grocery
[SPEAKER_02]: store and buying some bananas from Dole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really there's what we use in making
FPJ or FFJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second, Shingo.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we use in making FPJ or FFJ is the
natural microbes on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to ferment itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at a surface of a banana
fruit under a microscope growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: wild, it's covered in yeast and bacteria
and sometimes fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they live on the surface of these
leaves and fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you harvest it, especially if you
follow the natural farming protocol to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest it early in the morning,
at the peak kind of dew activity,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting all the microbes necessary
to properly ferment that fruit right there
[SPEAKER_02]: on the fruit surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you buy it from a store,
it's been bleach washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even organic has been bleach washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only microbes that are present to
ferment that are what was on the hands of
[SPEAKER_02]: the grocer that put it on the shelf or on
your hands when you put it on the conveyor
[SPEAKER_02]: belt or picked it off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, what was in the air and it's
really too limited for proper
[SPEAKER_02]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get really weird results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that most of us are attracted by
the sexy fruits, the tropical ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I mean, heck,
how many times have I heard people say
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've used papaya because they want
their weed to taste like papaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like preposterous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the Pacific Northwest,
some of the local people they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: like stuff that is, you know, not as
popular, say like rose hips, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rose hips are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they work great, but they're not
necessarily like sexy unless you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: cool farmer herbalist people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they go for the big bang thing and
they want to go with the papaya or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever from the store when actually
that, you know, the rose hips or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even the crab apples on your tree that are
on your tree with your microbes are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be way better for you than the more
popular fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, you're lapped into
the concepts of terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really it's, I think in part,
it's a result of much of us being from
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaii where this landed as far as the
English speaking education of natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're messing with banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teaching it using banana flower or
people are talking about it using papaya
[SPEAKER_02]: and they do have wonderful nutrients,
but it's not better than the rose hips or
[SPEAKER_02]: the crab apple or the apple from your
neighbor's house or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a superior thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have a slightly different
nutritional profile, but we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily chase nutritional profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we deal with FPJ, what we want is
a thriving plant that isn't hit by bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: because what it's doing is it's expressing
complete nutrition and therefore is packed
[SPEAKER_02]: with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you have an anemic sexy plant,
you know, like a papaya and it's totally
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling to make it and it's,
it's going to have poor nutrition,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though you're going for it for some
specific nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to say ice plant or rose hips or
something that's just thriving and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't kill it with a brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of ice plant here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, ice plant would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chango start making an FPJ out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Chris, I know that your kids are
going to come in like a tsunami here any
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably a good time for us to
wrap up before, before they hit the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I really appreciate you
coming back to spend time with us here on
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your, your experience is so
valuable to everybody and oh, here they
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I really appreciate your time,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to having you back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks for talking Chango and thanks
for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, reach out anytime.
