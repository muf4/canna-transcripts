[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the 100th episode of
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the meat of the program,
I'm gonna take a little bit of time here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the show and share some of
the philosophy and themes behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire podcast that we've never
really talked about in the first 100
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get questions about these things and I
figure I might as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what better time than 100th episode to
share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one is, of course, the main
guide behind the program is to make
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that access is increasing
across the United States as normalization
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of creeps in and it's good to support
those stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I also think that patients should
be able to grow and produce their own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and preparations at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every episode of Shaping Fire works
towards that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, each episode I try to make sure is
packed with information that you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: action on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to include everything you need in an
episode to make a decision or take action
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least feel like you have a handle on
that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too often I listen to a podcast to learn
and I'm only given about 65 or 70% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information I actually need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I still have to continue my
research to fill in the holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Shaping Fire episodes, I really try
to get and give you everything you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: start making decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, there's almost always more
research that's needed, but at least you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you have the basics covered and
you can go forward on your second layer
[SPEAKER_00]: research with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I book Shaping Fire episodes or my guests
based on topics and I don't do company
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and I don't do people profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a topic that I'm interested in and
I think that the audience would be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in and that is under covered in
cannabis media.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've got that topic and what I want
to cover, I then go and find a guest who
[SPEAKER_00]: is an industry expert in that area and
then I invite them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week I get lots of people interested
in being on the show or their press agents
[SPEAKER_00]: and they let me know that this person is
very interesting, except Shaping Fire is
[SPEAKER_00]: not about that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire is about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the people who are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see my role as a role of service,
bringing you topics that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in learning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just go and find the right
person for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before people are on my show, we have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they too understand that this show is
not about them and it's not about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this show is a role of service for
cannabis patients and that's how we treat
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who don't work in that way,
they don't end up on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I choose guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, I choose my advertisers based
on those same kinds of morals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose advertisers that have a message
or a product that I actually think that
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative minded cannabis users are
going to be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, you don't see me
accepting money from a bottled salt
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, do they want to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gosh, have I had to turn down a lot of
money, but it would be very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for me to have all of these
regenerative guests and then cut to an
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial that is some kind of A plus B
salt nutrient for indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just would be out of integrity for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't do it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fight with trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just restrict them and move on with my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people really get into
the fight online and I just don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have the energy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that feeling of stress in the
middle of my chest when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in online fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just don't even respond and I block
them or restrict them and get on with my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got way more important things to do than
internet fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first podcast, my first 55 of them were
actually for gongenpreneur.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with them for a year doing weekly
shows and I recommend that you go over to
[SPEAKER_00]: gongenpreneur.com and check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the guys there, but you know,
I realized that I was pretty darn good at
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcasting thing and I wanted to own
all my own intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said goodbye to the fellas and I wish
them the best and we're all still friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and I formed Shaping Fire so that I could
be in control of my own destiny,
[SPEAKER_00]: choose my own advertisers, own my own
intellectual property and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now five years in, I think that was a
great decision and happily I've been met
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of success and can support
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done a hundred episodes of
Shaping Fire over the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 per year, roughly twice a month with a
break around Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 20 episodes a year, it's certainly
not as fast as many podcasts that have got
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly or even daily episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just never been interested in that
and I spend too much time curating my
[SPEAKER_00]: content and finding difficult to find
guests and then reading them and reading
[SPEAKER_00]: their books before they're on the show or
if they're a scientist, all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific papers and doing lots of
episodes has just never been attractive to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather do less shows and have them be
more in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that isn't to shame anybody else's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's lots of room in this scene
for lots of different shows and people
[SPEAKER_00]: love different types of entertainment and
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while Shaping Fire isn't the show that
I'm going to be smoking out with the guest
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to be talking about what
we're smoking on, there's certainly a
[SPEAKER_00]: place for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's enough room for
everybody and certainly my audience
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciates how I approach things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the YouTube channel in case
you're not familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost 200 videos of various
speakers speaking on cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: entheogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of funny because the YouTube
channel was an accident actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started traveling back in 2015 or
so, people were flying me out to speak at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was at the cannabis convention,
I was also going to see really good
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers and it seemed like a waste to not
record them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I went to see a speaker,
I also recorded the speaker so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could bring home that content to you so
you could enjoy it without ever having to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started dumping those videos onto
the YouTube channel and eventually more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more people started watching them and
subscribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got over 10,000 subscribers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're at like 13,000 perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over a million and a half minutes
served and serving 30 to 40,000 people a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't generate any money at all,
but it's just a good resource for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad we started it all that time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk in this episode a lot about
patients I've been involved with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have, but I don't practice medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I have an office?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor do I charge a fee for these
consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear me refer to patients a lot
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply because when you are
interviewing medical doctors and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists every week, and then speaking
about that publicly, you start to attract
[SPEAKER_00]: people with questions and stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tend to keep in contact with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been over this decade of
learning from patients that I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to amass this knowledge for myself as
a cannabis patient and to help the people
[SPEAKER_00]: around me here on Vashon Island where I
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to be sure that I am
not a doctor and I am not cosplaying as a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor at all, nor charging money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not practicing medicine without a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always encourage you to talk to your
doctors about anything that you decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: do after listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, with this episode, I'm trying
to offer this dosing information in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: so people don't have to reach out to me
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, this is not an invitation to
send me Instagram messages and emails
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me about your specific ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really working with patients
anymore except for my local neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that you get what you need from
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to make it as complete as
possible just for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going forward, you can expect more soil
episodes, more regenerative techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: more making hash and oil and such at home,
and of course, more cannabis and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to keep up with the
mushrooms, DMT, and other entheogen topics
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being part of the Shaping
Fire community, and thanks for telling
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends about Shaping Fire.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is, well, me, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a cannabis educator for the
last decade and have been involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine since 1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have listened to the stories of more
patients than I can count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I founded the Vashon Island Marijuana
Enthusiasts Alliance many years ago to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather cannabis patients and those who
love them to share best practices and to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in international guest speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, oh boy, has that been a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I presently spend my time producing the
Shaping Fire podcast as I recover from
[SPEAKER_00]: burnout and study neurodivergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a long episode, but I was careful
to add out anything that felt like filler.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that it's a comprehensive guide
for those who are new to dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids so they can take their next
steps toward healing with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time I've ever recorded
solo like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps cut me some slack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like this sort of episode,
please let me know because I have an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode like this written on the 90-day
cancer protocol too that I do if you
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to like this format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, friends, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been wanting to record this episode
for a couple of years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most common things that
I'm asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach about dosing a lot to small groups
of people in their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally I'm asked to do this talk
at conventions or caregiver events or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are always so informal and
there's always lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never really seemed appropriate to put
any of those recordings out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first time here for the 100th
episode, I figured I would give it a shot
[SPEAKER_00]: to put this body of information that I've
got here for you so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially learn some yourself and share
it with caregivers and family and friends
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that can get folks up to speed on
cannabis dosing in a way that is useful to
[SPEAKER_00]: them in their everyday life and isn't
packed with misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we all know, most of the
information that you can get from just
[SPEAKER_00]: searching online is pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will take a moment and plug
projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin Lee has done a great job pulling
together accurate cannabis information
[SPEAKER_00]: with excellent articles on different
medical conditions and using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of all the articles,
they have got links to all of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis white papers on that particular
cannabis medical topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I would recommend that you go
anywhere else, it would be to Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode is primarily designed for
patients and those who love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much consider everyone who uses
cannabis to be a quote, cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if you're just using cannabis
recreationally, because it makes you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good and maybe decreases your anxiety and
causes you to have fun when you're out in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature or playing video games or whatever,
you're using it as a euphoric to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your life so that you have a life that's
worth living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are hard now for a lot of people
and a lot of us turn to cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to point out that the vocabulary
I'll be using today is layman's vocabulary
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true that I do a lot of teaching to
caregivers and doctors and nurses and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that to help them understand
how best to assess and plan for and dose
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine in their clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vast majority of the people that I
talk to are just like regular folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: like somebody's mom, somebody's uncle,
somebody's neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hell, a lot of the times it's just the
people that I run into at the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store on the island where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the people that I talk to
most because I think that's where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have the most authentic impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode is for those folks,
for you folks who don't necessarily have
[SPEAKER_00]: medical training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you really want to have a specific
dosing information for yourself or to help
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience is with consulting,
teaching, however you want to put it,
[SPEAKER_00]: for over a thousand patients for almost a
decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also as a medicine maker for myself,
I've had a brain injury, a couple of car
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had the opportunity to
participate in the Washington medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market and learn lots of different
feedback from different types of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: at different ages and economic levels on
different types of products, from tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower to oedipals to what we call RSO,
but I don't prefer that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer just full extract cannabis oil,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you spend this much time talking
with people and learning everybody's best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, and then giving suggestions to
people and then hearing back from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed a pretty good body of
information in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then four years ago, I put together a
study on Vashon on CBD oil dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that was five years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three years ago, I did the same
thing with CBG oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought up a whole bunch of very
interesting applications for CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm just setting up one right now
on CBDV, the Varin version of Cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are opportunities that really
afford me a lot more first person
[SPEAKER_00]: information than even most clinical
doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we're going to talk
about some basics about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and different
methods of use of cannabis and their pros
[SPEAKER_00]: and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the second set,
we're going to talk about the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we are most familiar
with and we have actual dosing information
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to help get your head wrapped
around like how to actually apply this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third set is all about very specific
medical conditions that once we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: those medical conditions and how to think
through the dosing on those, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good idea of how to think through
similar medical conditions and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: think through dosing on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my goal with this episode is not
just like give you a spreadsheet in your
[SPEAKER_00]: head of, okay, if you've got this,
take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got this, take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really every human is different
and individualized medicine is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can attain with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of just giving you very
tight dosing specifications for assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's the same, I want to teach you
how to think about cannabis dosing so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand why the dosing is the way
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can make subtle changes based
on you or your patient's needs and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a more dynamic cannabis user than you
would be if you were just here hearing the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific milligrams you need because
honestly, people's dosing needs
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start by talking about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is the human
body's primary regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a thermostat for all of
the mission critical systems of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a system that's running hot,
it cools it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a bodily system that's
sluggish, it fires it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings everything back to the
middle, a balanced place, what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: in Chinese medicine to tonify,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To bring back into balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the endocannabinoid system
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of it and I often explain it as
being a second grade teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the second grade teacher is in the
classroom, the kids are generally
[SPEAKER_00]: behaving, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing their work and doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody comes to the door and the
second grade teacher needs to step out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the classroom, out into the hallway for a
moment, the kids will be fine for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually some kid will crack up or
make a noise and then another kid will
[SPEAKER_00]: crack up and then eventually a bunch of
the kids are cracking up until the second
[SPEAKER_00]: grade teacher comes back into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the endocannabinoid system is
thriving and strong, it is regulating all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those bodily systems the way that it's
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge comes in to when our
endocannabinoid system becomes weakened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different folks have different systems
fall into dysregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the odd things of why
endocannabinoid deficiency can look so
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you have a weakened
endocannabinoid system, different people
[SPEAKER_00]: have got different second grade students
that go bad, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody might see it in migraines and
somebody else might get it in irritable
[SPEAKER_00]: bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody else might get fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody else might get a combination
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the longer they ignore it,
they start to stack up more and more of
[SPEAKER_00]: these ailments from the endocannabinoid
system no longer effectively keeping their
[SPEAKER_00]: different bodily systems in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why it's so important to
keep the endocannabinoid system from
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most common first things we
see are IBS, fibromyalgia, migraines,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also autoimmune issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Parkinson's and dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ailments that at their core
have got an endocannabinoid base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit more about
endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are aspects of a dysregulated
endocannabinoid system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the endocannabinoid system is not
making enough endogenous cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means cannabinoids that are made in
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have enough signaling molecules
to go around the body and do the work and
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you refer to Dr. Ethan Russo's
original paper on endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency and you look at the causes for
endocannabinoid deficiency, it reads just
[SPEAKER_00]: like a normal day in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the five big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, environmental toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, pharmaceuticals that repress
the immune system or intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: dysregulate the human body in some way,
like chemo being an extreme example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but antibiotics are another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about any
pharmaceutical that's gonna be repressing
[SPEAKER_00]: normal endocannabinoid operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor sleep, poor nutrition and stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my gosh, that's just the modern
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very likely that most,
if not everybody in the country has got an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that explains why we've got,
this is such a terrible situation with so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people getting sick in different ways
and having weakened immune systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cause us to walk around our lives
with heightened anxiety and susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of disease and virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when teaching specifically about CBD,
cannabis medicine in general, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: about CBD, some people become skeptical
asking how can one supplement help so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ailments?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really just one thing that CBD
supports, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that system touches nearly everything
in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we add cannabidiol CBD as a
supplement, it just makes sense that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you would strengthen the body's
self-regulation system, that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: also empower the body to make the changes
it needs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why they say, oh, you got
migraines, CBD, you got irritable bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, you got CBD, you got poor sleep,
CBD, you got pain, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it can't be a panacea, but it is and
it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really does help alleviate all of
this suffering, but it's really just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's helping one system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that system is the endocannabinoid
system and that's the master regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just a matter of
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about this
firsthand from Dr. Ethan Russo,
[SPEAKER_00]: his seminal paper on that from 2004 called
Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency is
[SPEAKER_00]: available easily for free online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to the Shaping Fire website
for this episode, episode number 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a link to it for you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to hear Dr. Ethan Russo
talking about endocannabinoid deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: in medical cannabis, I actually did an
interview with him about endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency a long time ago back in 2015
when I was still a partner over at
[SPEAKER_00]: gonjpurnure.com and hosting the
gonjpurnure.com podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go over to gonjpurnure.com into
2015, you can find my interview with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russo there before I left gonjpurnure and
started Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also read a very helpful article
on endocannabinoid nutrition from 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's not an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another interview I did with Ethan
Russo at gonjpurnure again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a full year of weekly episodes
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did 54 episodes before I wished
them well and came over and started
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2016, that episode's called
Endocannabinoid Nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably really easy if you just
Google endocannabinoid nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo, gonjpurnure, that'll get you
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, more recently though, if you want to
learn more about endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics, I also recommend Shaping Fire
episodes 78 and 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both with Dr. Miyabi Shields,
who is an endocannabinoid researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk in detail about
endocannabinoid mechanics and kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Miyabi is absolutely a fantastic guest
and a pharmacologist and really
[SPEAKER_00]: understands the biochemical working of the
human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, so let's move on to the next
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always look up more on the
endocannabinoid system, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a good enough explanation for most
folks to get a good picture of it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we're gonna talk about
is method of use, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get the cannabinoids into your
body?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how we jump from endocannabinoids
to using the cannabis plant is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that the endocannabinoid
system creates and manages cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're made inside the body,
they're called endocannabinoids because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're endogenous to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're germane to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your body is not making them
because you have endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, you've got to get them
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to put them in your
body to strengthen your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you'd be able to decrease
those five things that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can start making your own
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the interim, you're gonna supplement
with phytocannabinoids, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that come from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your long-term goal is actually to take
phytocannabinoids from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also go back and fix as best as
you can the five things that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The poor sleep, all right, get better
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor nutrition, eat better food,
eat fresher food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't eat as much processed food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental toxins, well, that's pretty
difficult if you live in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do what you can to decrease
environmental toxins and then decrease as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as you can the pharmaceuticals in
your life that are screwing up your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, which for many of
these ailments we take pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: for, we would be better to take a cannabis
medicine full of phytocannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen our endocannabinoid system to
let the endocannabinoid system solve these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues for us instead of taking more
radicalized pharmaceuticals that often
[SPEAKER_00]: have unpleasant side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to get phytocannabinoids into
our body and those are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk about the different ways
that you can take the cannabis plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the most common way that
people get cannabis into their body,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is by smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the most traditional and accepted
way to use cannabis, dosing from smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants is hard because it's very
inexact and often patients don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: proper test results for whatever they are
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inexact part is that you don't know
how much of the flower or a joint or a
[SPEAKER_00]: bull or a bong to smoke to get the dosage
that you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're shooting for five or 10
milligrams of THC, it could just be an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra two puffs that take you from where
you want to be to actually being more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicated than you want to be and you've
missed the zone that you want to target to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you with your ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've all had the experience of
wanting to have a little puffy puff before
[SPEAKER_00]: we go somewhere and it ends up coming on a
lot stronger and then we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I guess I can't leave right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to wait to come down a bit
before you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're in the social time of your
day and you don't have a lot of pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: on you, well, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a lot of pain and you
have to get to work, if you're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of suffering and you have to stay
sharp to take care of your kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: really smoking may not be the way to go
because it is so hard to titrate your
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage and know exactly what you're
taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, most patients don't have test
results for the flower that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks don't get the flower that they
grow at home tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks don't get analysis testing when
they buy their weed from their neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're shopping at a medical or a
licensed recreational store, they may or
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have the analysis on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states, they don't have to have it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need to have it back at the
original grower and you can email them for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big difference whether or not
it's available in the store or if it just
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically exists in the world and you
could ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just because there is a certificate
of analysis in the store and you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it, that doesn't necessarily mean those
are the ratios that are in your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different parts of the plant
will develop different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things on the top that are going to
the flowers on the top that are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and more intense sunshine,
they will develop different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: than flower that is more in the interior
or on the middle or towards the low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so different parts of the plant are
actually going to be different medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, smoking cannabis results in
cannabinoid conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a myth that the lab results
that you are getting about your flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing what exactly is going into your
body when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from significant research that
when you combust the flower, the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids convert to different
cannabinoids often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get this cannabinoid drift and
you would only know what you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in your smoke by testing the
smoke, which is not something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available to new and nearly anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why smoking moves so fast is
because when you inhale the smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs are very efficient at bringing
in cannabinoids through the lung and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly in the blood and then it's
very quickly to your brain and distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: around your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon as you smoke, within the
first 10 to 15 minutes, you take this
[SPEAKER_00]: fast, fast ride up this roller coaster and
then you slowly start to come down over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you are using a different
method, which we'll talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going up really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going up at a measured pace and
you're coming down as a measured pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for repeatable for results and for
continuing to be able to be productive
[SPEAKER_00]: during your day, this is what is called
for most of the time for patients rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously with the added caveat that if
you have got an acute situation as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient and you need medicine now,
top of mind would be a severe pain
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and some types of anxiety
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to smoke now and you
need the cannabinoids to hit your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those folks, certainly smoke and
smoking makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking for most ailments
that most cannabis patients have,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking will not be your option because
it's too uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis oil is the concentrated resin
that is found in the trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the majority of the medicine
lives that we remove from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different solvents that
you can use to remove cannabis oil from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, hydrocarbons have been
very popular, butane, propane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been a lot of pushback around
that because not everybody knows how to
[SPEAKER_00]: purge those hydrocarbons from the oil
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that can end up in your human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I much prefer, as does many medicine
makers, to use ethanol because ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: does a really good job at removing the
vital components of the resin and is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to remove after the fact by just
adding a small amount of heat and the
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol just vapes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty hard to get into trouble
with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly what is most called for
for home medicine creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I've got a lot of respect
for licensed companies that use ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though it's a little bit more
laborious than hydrocarbons often,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gives a much better snapshot of
all of the healing potential that is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of people call it RSO,
Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Rick Simpson deserves some respect
for popularizing RSO, it's not like he
[SPEAKER_00]: invented it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did bring it to a larger audience and
for that we'll ever be grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of his original recipes,
when we look at now, they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a little sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But building on what Rick made popular,
there are now more modern processes that,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, use ethanol, which is the
primary solvent used nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all still kind of call it RSO
because that's what people know it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been a whole bunch of other names
have been tried to be given to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another popular one is FECO, full extract
cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, FECO sounds like fecal
though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think FECO is ever gonna like
catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully nationally, but full extract
cannabis oil, I mean, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some companies have tried to name
their process different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll probably sometimes accidentally
say RSO during this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I usually call it full extract
cannabis oil and just say those words and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't usually use FECO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're at least familiar with the
terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons why using a full
extract cannabis oil is probably at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the list of what to use as a
patient is because once the oil was made,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the oil is pretty uniform and
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, oh, this part of the batch
has got these cannabinoids and this part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this batch has got these other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have soaked the cannabis in the
ethanol and then gone and vaped off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol, the sticky resin that you're left
with is pretty homogenized and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you go ahead and you send it
off to a cannabis lab to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics done, you know that those
analytics are representative of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can compare that to what we were
just talking about, about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, where the flowers that are at the
top, middle, bottom or interior of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will all have slightly different
cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time it's in oil, because it's
all been put, you know, it's all been
[SPEAKER_00]: soaked and vaped off together,
your oil is essentially uniform and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you happen to live
somewhere where you don't have access to a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis lab, at least you know that when
you take your first trials of your oil to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how strong you made it, once you've,
you know, you've taken it three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: times and you're like, okay, I know how
much I need as a patient of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be like that for the rest of
that oil that you take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're gonna take the first
couple and you're gonna be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I now know that I need, you know,
0.05 milliliters of this oil for the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal experience that I'm looking for,
only to like take that same amount four
[SPEAKER_00]: days later and you're like, oh my God,
I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's not what medicinal cannabis
is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal cannabis is about repeatable
results that you can rely on to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your health, improve the strength of your
endocannabinoid system and allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: take cannabinoids while you can still
function in life by, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work or taking care of your
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, I don't know, if you're bad enough,
just live, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking for repeatable results
and that is one great aspect of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's great about cannabis
oil is, you know, when you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, flour costs money if it's got any,
it costs more money if it's got any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of bag of peel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the least expensive flour to buy is
flour that is ugly and I don't mean all
[SPEAKER_00]: molded and such, but I mean like mids and
lowers and stuff that was trimmed badly or
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't trimmed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is the best stuff to be making
cannabis oil out of and it also happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the cheapest stuff in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it's not uncommon for a home
grower to take all of the tops off their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and cure them and either keep them
or sell them and then take all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowers and either process it themselves or
give it to a loved one who's a patient to
[SPEAKER_00]: make into cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, back in the day,
you know, we used to call that trash and
[SPEAKER_00]: so people would all like, where'd you dump
your trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of those, all that trim that
came off the plant, people weren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: doing extraction yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, people were just trying to find
places to dump it where no one would find
[SPEAKER_00]: it and bust them back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, people started
blasting BHO in their backyards and trim
[SPEAKER_00]: became like really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we've just evolved
from there that we now use every part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not gonna talk about making
cannabis oil today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to understand that the
advantages of cannabis oil in its,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency of analytical results
throughout the batch and the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: once you put it in a capsule and take it,
your body will process the capsule and
[SPEAKER_00]: take the cannabinoids in and then you will
slowly feel, you know, the cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: not feel them depending on the dose that
you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll slowly have an intensity of
cannabinoids and it'll slowly go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process usually takes between
three to four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a patient who is doing a cannabis oil
protocol will often take their capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: every three to four hours depending on,
you know, their needs and what they can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I wanna say about the
cannabis oil is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's usually offered in syringes,
like oral syringes, it's also quite easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to make capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks will pick up one milliliter
capsules on eBay, excuse me, one
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter syringes, oral syringes on eBay
and you make your oil at home and you fill
[SPEAKER_00]: your syringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the nozzle, the nipple,
not nozzle, on the one milliliter syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: fits really nicely into a number three
size capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes making your capsule is
really easy and the sides of the syringes
[SPEAKER_00]: are marked so you know whether or not
you're putting in, you know, 0.05
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter or 0.1 of a milliliter,
which is, you know, usually where most
[SPEAKER_00]: people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can take it by their... One
note, if you are going to buy your own
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules, I recommend that when you buy
them, buy them separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went years before I realized that you
could buy your capsules separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would just buy bags of capsules
that looked like capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'd have to separate them all by hand
before I filled my capsules with the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, when I was first
starting making my capsules after I got my
[SPEAKER_00]: dual concussion resulting in a traumatic
brain injury, like that was... Like
[SPEAKER_00]: filling capsules was mentally a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to make the process as
slow as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have been really nice to have
known that I could have just bought caps
[SPEAKER_00]: that came in two bags separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's pro tip for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about tincture now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the interesting things about
tincture is that tincture is at its most
[SPEAKER_00]: essential cannabis oil that we just talked
about suspended in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you make the cannabis oil,
you are using ethanol to extract the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: components from the trichomes on the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a tincture, what you have is the
cannabis resin suspended in ethanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what's used to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's certainly true that some people
will add vegetable glycerin or coconut or
[SPEAKER_00]: honey or a lot of other things to
adulterate the oil to make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: palatable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a straight ethanol tincture,
I mean, that's got some bite to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally tell patients that if they're
making an ethanol tincture to be prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: to just take their dose and put it in a
little bit of water and then just drink
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're going to be using food
grade ethanol at 190 proof, say for
[SPEAKER_00]: example, Everclear, I mean, Everclear
burns most people's tongues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just putting a little bit of water
in a sake glass or a shot glass and then
[SPEAKER_00]: adding your tincture to that will make the
ethanol a lot more palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to be in recovery from
alcohol and you have chosen to not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any alcohol at all in your life,
what many patients do is that they will
[SPEAKER_00]: make a hot tea, not boiling, but just like
hot tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll put their tincture into
the hot tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tea, just let it sit for a couple
of minutes and the hot tea will vape off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethanol aspect of it and it will just
leave the cannabinoids, the resin in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tea and then you just drink your tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that's great about
tincture is that when you put the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ethanol, once you let it sit for
a little bit, it will self homogenize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will become ubiquitous throughout the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which means that if you make your
tincture and you strain your tincture and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you let it sit for a day and let it
come to, I don't know, I wanna say
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis, but I don't think that's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you wanna, if you will give it time
to self homogenize, you can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a sample out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like using a turkey baster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a sample out of it and put it in a
little one ounce bottle and send it off to
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll know that the test results that
come back apply to the entire jar of
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture that you've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the same thing I like about
cannabis oil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's uniform and it is one of the
biggest problems with smoking flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause that's not uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tincture we like because it's really
easy for anybody to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't add the adulterants,
and I don't add any adulterants to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I make for myself and the stuff
that I make for my parents, because as we
[SPEAKER_00]: get older, it is more difficult to shake a
bottle of tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got cannabis resin in there,
maybe a little bit of ethanol and some
[SPEAKER_00]: glycerin, those have all got different
weights and they will not be uniform in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tincture bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you give it the kind of shake
that you can imagine you do with a
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture bottle, that's not going to
homogenize it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to kind of mix it up a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means that if you are taking a
tincture that has got THC in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can cause intoxication, you will not
be getting consistent doses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If one squirt of the dropper is usually
going to be 5% or 5 milligrams and your
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture has got honey or glycerin or
something else, you're going to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dropper could have anywhere between
maybe two to eight milligrams of THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really big swing for most
patients, especially new patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of folks can't, they don't have
the wrist, to be able to shake it anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've got arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're making your own stuff and
you're making a CBD and like the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: amount at any particular time doesn't
matter as much as you making sure you take
[SPEAKER_00]: it four times a day and making sure you
get a daily dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure, put glycerin or agave or honey
or whatever with your CBD because having
[SPEAKER_00]: each dose be exactly the same it's not
really as big of a deal with CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with THC it does because if you go too
high, you may get more THC than you are
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for that part of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's great about tincture
when it's in ethanol is that it's shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a lot of patients, you don't
have an opportunity to make tincture all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might grow your few outdoor plants
every summer and then you're gonna wanna,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll choose to process that in the
tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tincture needs to last you a
whole year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis oil and tincture in ethanol
are both quite shelf stable if you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them out of the sun and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis oil specifically does pretty
well in the crisper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're putting your, you don't have
to do that with the tincture as much
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the ethanol, you can either
just store it in a mason jar in a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: closet or if you wanna keep strict
controls over your use, you can put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into one ounce tincture bottles that you
can pick up online from places like
[SPEAKER_00]: specialtybottle.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just fill those bottles for
yourself, label them and put them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people managing their
tincture use that way is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very visual because you're like,
okay, I've made 30 bottles and this has
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta last me the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can just see them in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the box gets lower, you've got a
really good visual example of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know if you should be getting
nervous and maybe figuring out where to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some more flour to make some more or
more hopefully you're just reinforcing the
[SPEAKER_00]: peace of mind that you are a
self-sufficient cannabis patient and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take care of yourself and you've got
what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's great about tincture
is being able to control and fine tune
[SPEAKER_00]: your dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the cannabis oil that we talked
about and certainly with smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis oil because the oil is
concentrated, it's harder to hit low
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time when I'm talking to
patients, if their need is only for five
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 milligrams of THC, it makes sense
that they are going to use a tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: because a tincture, you can get it down to
number of drops out of the dropper if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with oil, which is essentially the
resin without the ethanol that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture, it's kind of hard to extract
resin from a plant that's high in THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: get your dose down to five or 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might at 0.05 milliliter, which is
usually one of the smallest markings on a
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe, you might already be up to like
17 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes to THC, I'm usually
recommending that new patients to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a very significant ailment
and your tolerance is very high because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking a whole bunch of THC every
day, well, you've probably graduated up to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's different if we're talking
about CBD and CBG, where if we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a plant that has CBG, we might use
tincture so that we can have it last
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, but in most cases, you'll probably
make an oil and then just make caps with
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.05 in it because it's just more
convenient and you don't have to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol in the tincture bottles and you
can pre-make a whole bunch of capsules
[SPEAKER_00]: because the difference, whether or not you
take five, 10 or 20 milligrams of CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't end up in you potentially getting
intoxicated like it would if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I make my CBG caps, I'm a little
more casual about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make my THC caps, I'm very exacting
because I don't wanna accidentally over
[SPEAKER_00]: medicate myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm making CBG caps, well,
I might watch TV while I'm doing it or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I squirt a little bit extra in,
it's not really going to be bad in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be a little wasteful, but it's not
gonna make me super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the reasons why
tinctures are good because once you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: test results and you know how much is in
one dropper of your tincture, if you wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: take a little bit less one day or a little
bit more another day, you can totally make
[SPEAKER_00]: those changes on the fly and it gives you
as a patient a lot of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days you might wake up and you know
you have to go to a doctor's appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you wanna go a little bit more
conservative on how much THC tincture that
[SPEAKER_00]: you take because you know that you're
gonna have to interact with people in an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour or something or maybe drive there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But on another day, you may have slept
really bad and you are experiencing your
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments significantly and you don't have
anywhere to go and you might triple your
[SPEAKER_00]: doses because you're like, all I'm gonna
be able to do today is sit on the couch
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to not be miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that gives you that kind of
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've already made all of your oil
into capsules, well, unless you've made
[SPEAKER_00]: different potency capsules, all your
capsules are gonna be the same strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is a great reason that
tincture can be a superior choice for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So edibles have got a place, but I gotta
admit that I am not the biggest fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles except for specific kinds of
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first I'll talk a little bit about why
I tend to recommend cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture over edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we'll also talk about why edibles
are the perfect thing for particular
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, edibles are usually
non-homogenized or poorly homogenized,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means either at home or at a
licensed cannabis bakery, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: infusing an oil, a fat, a butter with
cannabis, either the flour or an oil or an
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're mixing that into the oil and
then you add that oil to your recipe of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of this discussion,
let's say that they're making brownies
[SPEAKER_00]: since that's so traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mix it into your brownies and
then you bake your brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of us who have been using
cannabis for a few decades, we've all had
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience where you make a batch of
brownies and the first brownie you have is
[SPEAKER_00]: a different strength than the fifth
brownie which is a different strength than
[SPEAKER_00]: the 10th brownie, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's kind of just luck of the draw
where how much oil ends up at different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the brownie pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could eat one and it could,
you're like, okay, I know that if I eat
[SPEAKER_00]: half a brownie, that's about the right
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to eat a different brownie
and that half a brownie actually has got a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot more oil on it just from luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from randomness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now suddenly you're like, you know,
really high and you need to go lay down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, damn, I really thought
that all those brownies were gonna be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very, very hard to do with
baked goods, especially in the home,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this primarily happens when people
share the cookies or whatever that they
[SPEAKER_00]: make at their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're moving along and
they just mix the brownies or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: until it gets the right consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it being the right consistency may
not be also homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly now you're making brownies
that where each one you have is a lottery
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket to being two stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one significant issue with
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, certainly in the commercial markets
where they are increasingly using isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have more control over their
products and processes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of these 10 milligram
gummies, for example, they're quite,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, homogenized, you know,
unless any company that's got a worthwhile
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and kitchen is doing a pretty good job
putting those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not huge swings, but that's not
true, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a company that's newer or have
less experienced employees or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what's happening as,
you know, some States go medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you get all these people who are
trying to go professional for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time and they made edibles at home,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're suddenly trying to scale
up, but they haven't learned their lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: and best practices yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so suddenly you've got a new company
in a medical market that's putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles with wild swings with their
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they'll get complaints and
they'll get best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, eventually with time
they'll be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're buying from them at a
medical shop, you know, early on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: state's process, chances are very high
that you're going to get something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a certain level of risk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for many of the patients that I
talked to, they're not in a position to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking on these extra sugars and flowers
and artificial colors and sometimes even
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial flavorings that edibles have,
especially if you are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: an advanced patient and you need edibles,
you know, four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's go back to the brownie
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you shouldn't be having a brownie
four times a day or a cookie or probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you may decide for you that
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're all our own empowered patients,
but I'm talking about general best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, the edibles that
are available you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to eat them four times a day or
maybe even every evening before you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: bed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking it for insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be really aware of the,
you know, what your cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: encapsulated in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they surrounded by, you know,
sugars and GMO flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are really healthy whole
plant resin edibles out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they almost always cost more because
they're made with quality food products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they might not have them by
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we're going to talk
about is the delayed effect due to
[SPEAKER_00]: digesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our first example, when we were
talking about smoking at top, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: great things about smoking is that it
comes on so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all, you know, you're peaking
on your cannabinoids in your bloodstream
[SPEAKER_00]: at, you know, 10 to 15 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super fast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles are the opposite, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to chew it up and
then you're going to swallow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it hits your gut and then it goes
through your liver and then now it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: your blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it comes on, you know, most people
say between 30 to 45 minutes, but for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everybody should be aware that
sometimes you do get a sneaker edible and
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a while for your body to process
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you had a meal earlier and so the
edible is actually behind all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: food that's got to go through you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, sometimes it does take two
hours, but you know, that's pretty rare
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to like 30 to 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you need relief now,
waiting for 45 minutes may not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: right solution for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you've got to wait for
yourself and your own needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing that's interesting about
it is that when THC goes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver, it changes to 11 hydroxy THC in the
liver, which means that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we're, you know, we're talking
about cannabis and even though we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about THC, it's really a different
form and it, it feels different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts differently on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is probably where the best
benefit of edibles comes from because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are certain patients, I would put at
the top of the list, pain patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis patients,
and pretty much any of the inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, lots of immune compromised
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find that the 11 hydroxy THC
experience that comes from an edible is
[SPEAKER_00]: far superior to them than a Delta 9 THC
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll have to find this out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 11 hydroxy THC is not going to
be the choice for most patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for those that it works better for,
they become very serious about their
[SPEAKER_00]: edible consumptions and making sure that
they are finding the edible that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: make homogenized, that is low in sugar,
that they can eat the smallest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: edible and get the more profound effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and it really does become
something that the patients are dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, sometimes 11 hydroxy THC is
the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll just have to, if you are that
patient, you will, you will come to that
[SPEAKER_00]: realization yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to let you know that it's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A very common way to take THC,
but also probably not necessarily the best
[SPEAKER_00]: for most patients if you're going to be
taking it every day because you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture or a cannabis oil that's not
going to have any of those extra sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowers and colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the last one we're going to talk
about is suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, suppositories are not used
all that much because usually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking your cannabinoids orally
is going to be appropriate for just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have certainly worked with patients
who came to me because they were having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems taking their cannabis oil orally
because they had something going on that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, chronic and devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, putting anything into
their gut was a really bad experience or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially they have something going on
in their gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't take any fats or oils into
their gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's true that
cannabinoids in cannabis oil are really
[SPEAKER_00]: great for your gut, but it's also really
bad for your gut.
And so, you know, putting anything into
their gut was a really bad experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the vehicle is an oily resin from
the plant, you know, some patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't be taking any oil into their
gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, or else, you know, it causes,
you know, lots of grief and suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a case as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there are other ones that I
haven't come across, right, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, potential ulcers or lacerations
in the gut that, you know, you might not
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get oil in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some people, they need to skip the
gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are some other ailments that
suppositories are just a great idea for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, for menstrual cramping,
right, for menstrual cramping,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use a suppository either in the
rectum or in the vagina, and you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: more targeted placement of the
cannabinoids to relieve your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to put cannabis oil in a
vagina, be really careful about the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: you use because you don't want to throw
off the pH and cause other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, we don't really have the same
kind of pH issues for the rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, rectal cancer, right, if you are,
you know, if you are dealing with tumors
[SPEAKER_00]: or such in the rectum, placing the
cannabis oil right there is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the level of, you know,
targeting that you can do for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, if you've got, like,
you know, just general hip pains,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, if you've got, if you've got pains
or discomfort in, you know, in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: between, say, your belly button and your
thighs, right, like, that whole area,
[SPEAKER_00]: applying it to the rectum may be a
solution that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, most people are going to
take it orally, and it can work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, this is where you decide
because every patient works out their own
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you learn these things from
people who have done it before you,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you do this for two weeks,
and now you're going to become the expert
[SPEAKER_00]: on your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're, that's what,
you know, good cannabis educators are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do is give you all of the options
and say, choose what works for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of saying, all right, I have the
solution for all patients, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, each patient is unique, just like
growing different types of cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: unique, you know, and we need to,
we need to treat each person in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: works the best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've decided that suppositories
are something that might be appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, there's lots of great kits out
there for making your own at home on,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, eBay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell these little molds that mold
them into like a little suppository,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a football, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of different recipes
that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use shea butter, some people
use coconut oil, some people use a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination, along with a little bit of
full extract cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people find what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people won't use shea at all because
they don't care for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will have different
percentages of each, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you do is you would make up,
you'd fill up these little molds with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're going to put in your
suppository, and then you put them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get hard, and then you pop
them out like ice cubes out of an ice cube
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's time to dose,
you just like pop one of those out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer and you put it where you're going
to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you might be cold for a
moment, but it doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they're that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it melts where you put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be a really great win for
a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, it doesn't have to be that much
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was first learning about
suppositories and practicing with them so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could teach it to patient groups,
I went through that whole process and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh my God, this is so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's so like kind of oily
and everything on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, you know, I realized that you
can also just take a boring cellulose cap
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would use for cannabis oil,
you know, up in the cannabis oil section
[SPEAKER_00]: when we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just put your cannabis oil in a
cellulose cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put that in your rectum too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would do that vaginally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your rectum, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the fluid that's in your
rectum will break down the cap and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get the oil through the rectum
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most people do recommend
against it just because it's kind of in
[SPEAKER_00]: the elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're a serious
cannabis patient and you are already to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that you need to be taking
suppositories, you are probably doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do and don't really care about
elegance anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you're at that point,
you're doing what you need to do to not
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there are the great options
because, you know, there is nothing as
[SPEAKER_00]: luxurious as a shea butter and coconut oil
suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you don't have the time
for that or the money for the inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in a vegan cellulose cap works
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great topic to end this set
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal at this point in the show was
for you to have a really solid
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the different methods of
cannabis intake and the good picture for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself of the endocannabinoid system,
why we are taking cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this platform, we will now in the
second set go into specific cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding the amount of each that
we would want to take to reach different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go ahead and take a
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the 100th episode of
Shaping Fire, and I am Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without these advertisers, Shaping Fire
would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and

[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is finally a revolution and a
revolutionary replacement for peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: that provides better benefits while being
a sustainable choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: in tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use,
and pit moss is inert, so it won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient-enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens, and small
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to the 100th episode of
Shaping Fire, and I am your host,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we talked about the
endocannabinoid system, made sure you had
[SPEAKER_00]: a decent understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked about the different
methods of getting cannabinoids into your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're starting to get an idea of
how your body functions and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that we can add the cannabinoids to
meet your particular needs as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now on set two, what we're gonna talk
about is the specific dosing for
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cannabinoids that are commonly
available and that we have actually got
[SPEAKER_00]: some decent research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna go through all of the
cannabinoids that exist because some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them we barely know anything about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we do know quite a bit about THC
and CBD, and we know a bit about CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are going to cover those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that with those three,
you can get well on your way to relieving
[SPEAKER_00]: your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also once you understand how to think
about individual cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: as new cannabinoids become popular and the
research starts to come out, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea of how to think through bringing
a new cannabinoid into your health
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to start with a conversation
about isolates and whole plant resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have originally, and I would have
in the old days say that whole plant resin
[SPEAKER_00]: versus isolates because historically I
have not been a fan of isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, as the quality from some
distributors have increased and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't have access to certain novel
cannabinoids, there is a place for
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates in the health program of many
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really can't justify writing them
off anymore, though it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what their good uses are and where
their limitations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, let's go back a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically, people sought whole plant
cannabinoids simply because it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people took the plant and they
used the resin as they got it off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, either by smoking the plant or
mechanically removing the trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: making hash or as solvents were developed,
mixing it with ethanol alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whole plant was like the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as technology evolved, the creation of
isolates became possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies were very
interested in isolating these compounds so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could study them for potential
future healing products in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with the term
isolate, the isolate just means a single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one single molecule of THC or one
single molecule of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a whole plant resin,
you're getting a melange of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and flavonoids and fats and
all these other things that make for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular synergy, which works so well
with the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I saw that there was a
really good reason to consider CBD isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the early days of CBD before CBD
plants were available just anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time not too long ago,
let's see, let's call it like seven or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years ago, where people started
wanting CBD, but getting your hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were bred with CBD was pretty
challenging unless you lived in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were getting them from folks there
who were intentionally trying to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got to a point where people
wanted CBD and they especially wanted CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: in their cannabis oil concentrate,
but it just wasn't to be had in any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of significant dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so companies started filling that void
by extracting CBD single molecule isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cannabis plant and selling that
separately as a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I was pretty against that
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As being an over-processed product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I got over myself and realized
that you didn't have to take CBD powder
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, and we would eventually find out
that CBD powder is helpful for some
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, that the important thing was
people should have the understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can spike their regular THC dominant
cannabis oil with CBD to expand the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember speaking first with Dr.
Sunil Agarwal at the Washington Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him while he was speaking,
whether or not he thought that spiking THC
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant cannabis oil with CBD to make it
slightly more whole plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since CBD used to be in land race plants,
but we progressively bred it out over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cannabis plants were stronger in
THC, so a land race, a natural plant
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has a lot more CBD in it than the
bred plants that are used for more
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, he said that would make
sense to me, to him, Dr. Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that until more plants can be
evolved that have a significant amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD in them and they can be distributed
across the country, if you can get CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate, go ahead and add that into your
brew when you are making your THC dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO or cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was caught off guard, but I
considered myself smarter for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on an episode with Dr. Ethan
Russo about five years ago, I asked him
[SPEAKER_00]: the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, yeah, yeah, if you need CBD and
you can't find whole plant CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, go ahead and take the isolate and
then spike your cannabis oil because your
[SPEAKER_00]: THC dominant cannabis oil will have the
THC, of course, plus it'll have a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those other flavonoids and
cannaflavin and novel cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're adding a heaping dose of
CBD from the isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while everyone agreed that when
possible, it's always better to just
[SPEAKER_00]: extract the plant and take the plant as
is, because we don't live in a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: world and sometimes you need to spike your
oil with a cannabinoid you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that's interesting to
consider when comparing isolates and whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is that in the early days of
cannabis research, they were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis research with the whole plant
resin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the early studies that you can look
up when you read what they were using and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they actually performed it,
they were extracting a THC dominant resin
[SPEAKER_00]: and experimenting with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as creeping normalization started and
pharmaceutical companies started
[SPEAKER_00]: considering what pharmaceutical products
they were gonna make out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, suddenly the medical studies,
scientific studies started focusing more
[SPEAKER_00]: on isolate because the two main advantages
of isolate are that number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do isolate the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can be sure for repeatability
of results because you can make that
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate molecule discreet from all the
other components that are usually in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, you can't patent the
plant, but if they made a medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: they made it out of isolate, well,
then they would be able to patent that and
[SPEAKER_00]: call it a product and sell it,
which is how you get products like
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the scientific studies
now, they are much more dominantly using
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate now to varying results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing we know is generally you
need to take a whole lot more isolate to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the same kind of results that you
normally get with a whole plant resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that when you take isolate,
your efficacy goes up to a point and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you take whole plant because
of all the synergistic materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally speaking, the more you take,
the more reaction you're gonna get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worthwhile to note too that whether
or not you want to use isolates or a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant often just depends on how much money
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no question that isolate is far
more affordable than a whole plant resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mileage may vary with it,
but if it's what you can afford and it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to give you benefit, well,
then you should definitely go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting as the market for
cannabis medicines and other fun products
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, how odd the price ratios work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, whole plant resin is very
expensive compared to isolate single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to have enough money to be
able to afford the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to CBD resin,
most patients, their dosage is as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can actually afford because they
always want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, the resin is very
expensive and the isolate is very
[SPEAKER_00]: inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in contrast, if you are a cancer
patient and you are trying to use THC to
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up beat the cancer and you're
taking a 90 day THC protocol versus doing
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo, well, suddenly now a THC cannabis
oil is very affordable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because spending $1,500 to $2,000 for 60
syringes to take over 90 days is very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable versus a round of chemo and all
the associated costs with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't jump to any conclusions about
cannabis medicine is so expensive or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine is so cheap or don't use
this or don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to think it through for
each patient what their unique needs are
[SPEAKER_00]: and what their financial capabilities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yet another reason why we really don't
wanna just group cannabis patients into
[SPEAKER_00]: big buckets and tell them what's good for
everybody because each patient is really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, with that discussion of whole
plant resin versus isolates past us,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go ahead and talk about the first
cannabinoid we wanna talk about in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of course is the very popular
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I mean Delta 9 THC,
tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the one that people have
known about forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one that if you take enough,
you can get intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They referring to that as a euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to take that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most of the things that patients
need, you do not need to take enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: you will necessarily get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC strongly activates the CB1
receptors in the body and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system triggering a
feeling of euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this activation also increases the
blood flow to the prefrontal cortex in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front of your brain, which is the area
that controls your ability to focus as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as your motor skills and attention
and memory and your ability to make
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then THC also interacts with CB2
receptors providing the analgesic or pain
[SPEAKER_00]: relieving effect, also giving muscle
relaxation and anti-inflammatory effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like helping with nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're thinking about THC dosing,
we have to be really aware that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: two different timeframes for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got what can THC help with me today
and what will THC help me with over the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short term effects of THC are
number one, it's an analgesic that lessens
[SPEAKER_00]: and softens your experience of the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a distractant and meaning that you
forget about your ailment and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on other things for a while,
like working or caring for the kids or
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on a fun activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say it's a distractant,
it kind of just makes you forget about the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that you are suffering from,
which is why it's especially good for PTSD
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can set aside their memories of a
trauma or of a war zone or of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and for a moment be distracted
by the use of the THC, which allows them
[SPEAKER_00]: to do other things that give their life
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that's one of the odd
additional ways that THC is an analgesic,
[SPEAKER_00]: because not only does it soften your
experience of the pain and kind of turn
[SPEAKER_00]: down the volume, but then it distracts you
from it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so THC actually helps with pain in two
different modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is used a lot by people who
are experiencing rheumatoid arthritis or
[SPEAKER_00]: just regular arthritis or swelling or
inflammation of the joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the short term, once you take some
THC, those will go down temporarily as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the short-term effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that more in the
longer-term effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned, it's also an anti-mimetic,
meaning that it decreases nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a muscle relaxant, which decreases
spasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're unfamiliar with that,
that is the involuntary clenching of your
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles that make your body feel all tight
and tense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can apply this to lots of different
types of patients, Parkinson's patients
[SPEAKER_00]: who have got tremors, also Parkinson's
patients who start to get crampy and they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to hunch over, people who have got
pain pretty much anywhere in their body,
[SPEAKER_00]: because very often the other side of their
body starts to clench in response to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side that you're trying to keep safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to keep one side of your
body out of harm's way, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: your other side of your body is doing more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those muscles tend to get tight and
annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also when you have muscles that
are relaxed, it decreases your experience
[SPEAKER_00]: of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so often with stress, we again,
we clench our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we're like, ah,
and you can kind of like open up and your
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles feel relaxed, your anxiety will go
down with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the THC can help with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally it can help with sleep
due to relaxation, because if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having a hard time sleeping because you're
stressed out and tight and in your pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you add some THC and suddenly your muscles
are relaxed and your pain is turned down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're kind of distracted from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some varieties of THC can cause
drowsiness and lethargy will boom,
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help with your sleep now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lethargy can be used for other
things too, or combined with other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to get a THC plant that
also is high in terpenes like myrcine or
[SPEAKER_00]: linalool, which are both relaxing,
you're really setting up a good
[SPEAKER_00]: combination for somebody who has insomnia,
especially if their insomnia is compounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by discomfort when they're trying to go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really good for people who have
just had surgery, because so many of us
[SPEAKER_00]: after we've had surgery, we're like,
okay, I'm feeling better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start moving around the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, no, you're supposed to
stay in that bed for a week and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to bring you food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people start to get antsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you give them some cannabis
stincture, well, they can enjoy that
[SPEAKER_00]: lethargy, take more naps, and be more
easily entertained with coloring books and
[SPEAKER_00]: crosswords and word searches and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that just keeps them in bed so their
body can heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last short-term effect of THC I'm
going to hit you here is as an appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stimulant and we can all joke about
getting the munchies and sometimes it is
[SPEAKER_00]: very funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's dangerous because we
eat all of our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for folks who actually are having a
difficulty eating, perhaps because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are going through cancer treatment or some
other kind of treatment that suppresses
[SPEAKER_00]: the appetite or they're depressed or
anything that's going to decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often, if you use cannabis,
well, suddenly you're feeling snacky
[SPEAKER_00]: because THC interacts with the hunger part
of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also THC makes food taste better and
smell better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're more likely to smell or
smell food being made in the other room
[SPEAKER_00]: and start to salivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh my gosh, I'm actually
hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are the short-term effects of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are additional benefits for
specific ailments, but this list gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: a good understanding of the most commonly
used benefits of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one or more of these are probably
appropriate for you or the patient that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all the things that THC will
do for you now, today, as soon as you take
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when taken over time from once a
day to twice a day or more for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, these daily benefits start to stack
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those reasons is a decrease in
chronic inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking THC and in that moment,
you're pushing back the inflammation a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you continue to do that over time,
you will be decreasing your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, not just decreasing it a
little bit for the next four hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you decrease it now and then you
take THC again in four hours and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: take it again in four hours and then you
do that tomorrow, you can decrease your,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, standard inflammation that your
body has, which by the way, gives you some
[SPEAKER_00]: time to decrease your discomfort while you
are trying to figure out what is causing
[SPEAKER_00]: your inflammation and decreasing those and
decrease those causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second long-term THC benefit that I
will tell you is probably the one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important and that is apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting to watch it
happen in a Petri dish, a THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule come up against a cancer cell and
burst its sidewall, which I swear has got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the word where the term apoptosis
comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kills the cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just took THC today,
it would kill some cancer cells and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of people use it as a
preventative for cancer because if there
[SPEAKER_00]: are any cancer cells in your body,
the THC will hopefully mop them up while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are taking THC every day,
you're killing cancer cells now and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're killing more in four hours and then
more in four hours and then more in four
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and then you sleep and then you do
it again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you start to stack these days
next to each other, suddenly you are
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing the size of tumors and other
forms of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen significant both
scientific and anecdotal evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: this works for a great many people on a
variety of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully there will be another
episode like this where I'll be doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: solo and I can lay out the entire
application of the cancer protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, just understand that it
causes apoptosis and it's a great thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: take as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, kind of the same category as
the apoptosis is the appetite stimulant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a short-term effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term, you can get weight gain from
the appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people who have got like a
wasting disease or they're just losing
[SPEAKER_00]: weight long-term because they're
depressed, well, you know, the munchies
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have today and tomorrow and the
third day, they start to add up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: start putting weight on and hopefully
start feeling better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, so now that we've kind of got an
idea of what the short-term effects are
[SPEAKER_00]: and the longer-term effects of taking THC
generally, let's start talking about some
[SPEAKER_00]: real specifics of the amounts,
the milligrams that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when taking THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first benchmark we wanna look at is
generally a sub-perceptible dosage of 2.5
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at 2.5 milligrams, you really
shouldn't feel it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a surprise if your patient
felt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they may have anxiety about it and so
they may think that they're feeling it
[SPEAKER_00]: because placebo is a strong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally at 2.3, unless somebody is
exceptionally sensitive, they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2.5 is generally pretty safe for most
people who are either scared of the
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxication experience or they've got
control issues and they don't like to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like they are in any way out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps they had a really negative THC
high when they were younger and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: never wanna feel that again and yet they
need THC for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for these people, we start them off
at 2.5 milligrams, which honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most of us who use cannabis regularly
might scoff at 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking 2.5 milligrams of THC
three to four times a day, every three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours and you're doing that every
day, you are going to see tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: results with your arthritis and other
sorts of inflammatory issues that just
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be addressed every day in a small
amount and not today in a large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't rule out 2.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used to create appetite and
to a lesser extent, but it is true to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit of muscle relaxation for
just like physical comfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be our first benchmark is
2.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: But five milligrams is where most people
start to feel it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often compared to one glass of wine
for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this five milligrams is the baseline
dose for most cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once patients get comfortable here,
many to most will move up to 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: if they also like the feeling of it being
a slight euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the job that you need is
getting done at five milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you take 10 milligrams and it's
also pleasurable, well, a lot of people go
[SPEAKER_00]: to that 10 milligram mark pretty quickly
just because they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if my medicine can make me feel good,
like, okay, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that the majority of edibles
that are sold in medical and licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational shops are 10 milligrams
because it just seems to be a uniform dose
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help a wide range of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll give you whatever it is,
10 milligram gummies, 10 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, 10 milligram gumdrops,
like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll likely give you 10 of those to a
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be 10 milligrams each,
and then they'll be in a package of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred milligrams that you can just take
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at this five to 10 area,
you're gonna need to, I mean, if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have an experience with cannabis already,
starting with 10 milligrams might surprise
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of the reasons why I
recommended Tincture earlier in the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you have zero experience with
cannabis starting with 10 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be great, but then also it might
not be for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of variability in folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though 10 milligrams sounds low
to people who use cannabis all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: to somebody who's particularly sensitive
and they've got a lot of CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, and so their body takes on a
lot of that THC really fast, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: have an uncomfortable, you know,
dysphoric experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever possible, you know,
perhaps start with a Tincture and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment at 2.5 and five and 10 and kind
of find out what your appropriate dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: is for what you're trying to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to understand what the really
high end of the numbers look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about extreme examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about like five or 10
milligrams for most folks if taken
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly, in contrast, it's common for
cancer patients seeking to beat the cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: to take as much as 750 milligrams of THC
of whole plant oil extract every day
[SPEAKER_00]: divided into three servings of 250
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're comparing a potential 10
milligram THC serving to a 250 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: serving three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole bunch and actually a
devastating amount actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you don't start at that
dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, part of the cannabis cancer
protocol is that you tight trade in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're starting with, you know,
lower amounts and then over the weeks you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the amount that you're taking
with the hope that by the time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking 250 milligrams at a time that
you've got some amount of THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness of what it is to be high and,
you know, awareness of what it means to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of uncontrollably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly people who can handle
250 milligrams, you know, no sweat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the vast majority of people will be
absolutely blown out at 250 milligrams to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that, you know, they could be
questioning their sanity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why you don't just take 250
milligrams without knowing what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a cancer protocol, why you titrate
your way in so you build up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to understand that the
maximum dose of THC that is necessary for
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient is really their call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though somebody might not be
taking high levels of THC intentionally to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause apoptosis in cancer, there are other
very unique patients who take
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my most significant example is
my buddy Nick Rysden back in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cannabis and dog breeder who also
has Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first visited him at his home,
I was astonished to see him taking 400 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 milligrams of THC and cannabis oil
three to four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just astonished as he's just
like, you know, squirting these syringes
[SPEAKER_00]: into his mouth to help quell his seizures
and ease his pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just astonished watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually afraid for him,
but he's like, oh man, I do this every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is where patients
start to really have to grow their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because being able to afford that
much as a patient on the open market is
[SPEAKER_00]: very unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why I always, you know,
stand up for patients having the rights to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow their own and be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing we're going to talk
about is, you know, once you're going over
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams, you're going to learn how
your particular body responds from THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can move away from dosage
guidelines like this one, because all it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take is a couple of weeks of you
taking THC every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are going to learn what works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so guides like this are to help you
understand how to think about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you're doing it, you become the
expert for your body because everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: body really is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I always recommend that people
keep a dosing journal of their cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use, because over time you might forget
how much you used to take for this or
[SPEAKER_00]: that, or you might want to look back and
see how you titrate it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're going to bother to tell
your doctor about your THC use as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your overall health solution, doctors like
really dig it if you can show them that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking, that you're, you know,
keeping a journal and that you're tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many doctors are already very
suspicious of cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can show that you're doing it
in a controlled, air quotes, responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: way, you know, they might be more likely
to, you know, play with you and not give
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you know, a hard time about using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two varieties of black swan
patients that we need to talk about before
[SPEAKER_00]: we end this discussion of THC
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, we're going to talk about
our rapid metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of human that just
metabolizes everything super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have worked with these patients and
they metabolize THC so fast, and often
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms and LSD and, you know,
anything you give them, they metabolize it
[SPEAKER_00]: super fast to get almost no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to know that these folks
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with this one patient who had no
experience with cannabis prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they decided that they,
you know, needed to take it for their
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started with, you know,
the, you know, the 2.5, five milligram,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligram and like didn't feel
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then moved up to 40 and didn't feel
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they found that their efficacious
dose was actually 80 milligrams of THC at
[SPEAKER_00]: a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and this patient was still like doing
stuff around the house and being
[SPEAKER_00]: productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's, it's actually what they
needed to take care of their their ailment
[SPEAKER_00]: and function like a normal human.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but if you told me that somebody who
had only been taking THC for two weeks was
[SPEAKER_00]: already at 80 milligrams, I would fear for
them, you know, that they, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were taking so much that,
you know, if they took that 80 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that they would have a very bad
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet this, this patient just like were
titrated themselves up over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they sit at 80 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that kind of rapid
metabolizer is very rare, but if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver, you know, it's also important
that you know that it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a patient, now you have
keywords to, to search so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: show your caregivers that yes,
you, you, you may require this much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second variety of Black Swan is that
it's estimated that about one in 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are wildly sensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point where, you know, only a,
a gram or two, or excuse me, a milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: or two is going to give them a very bad
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only seen this once.
[SPEAKER_00]: A patient reached out to me during their
very bad experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they took a, a five milligram
tincture that they got at the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: store and they experienced dysphoria,
hallucinations and like intense energy for
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours from such a small dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I wouldn't have believed it
if I hadn't first, if I hadn't seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: firsthand and I was familiar with that
product and knew that the analytics on it
[SPEAKER_00]: were, were likely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that, that dose is so small and
should have such an incredibly small
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do need to be aware that on the
rare occasion, you can give a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: dose to a patient and they will have an
outside, outsized response to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to need some support in,
you know, just trying to stay calm and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel okay until it wears off like towards
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I hope for you that you
don't come across either rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizers or, or hypersensitive folks
to THC, because it's always a real
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and as a caregiver, you know,
you feel so bad for them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're, they're, they're,
they're trying to do their best with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like blown out and they've
had a really bad experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and now they, they, now they really
hate cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I, I, I hope that, I hope that you
aren't one and I hope that you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, come across them in your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to CBD now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have got a pretty good idea
how to work with THC at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so CBD, which stands for cannabidiol,
it activates the CB1 and CB2 receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to a much lesser extent than THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't cause intoxication,
but it's certainly psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people say,
oh, it's not psychoactive, but while it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't get you high like THC will,
it is definitely certainly psychoactive in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that it can change perceptions
by bettering your mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: How CBD exerts its therapeutic impact on a
molecular level is still being sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol is a pleotropic drug,
which I don't usually have much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much opportunity to say in that it
produces many effects through multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientific literature has identified
more than 65 molecular targets of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study of these pathways has always
only just begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we do talk about CBD interacting
somewhat with the CB1 and CB2 receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: it isn't that they all just don't
interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They interact with a lot of things and
we're just now trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: those other types of receptors might be,
what those might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a very active signaling molecule
and it's one of the most useful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids for the endocannabinoid
system because of this variety of 65 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a lot to support the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels very much like a utility player,
like whatever's needed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: come, you know, fill in, you know,
a phyto cannabinoid version of CBD to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's definitely a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to THC, CBD has benefits now and
benefits later.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain THC is more of a help me today
cannabinoid and CBD is a bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: help me tomorrow cannabinoid because for
most of its applications, it takes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true that CBD too has some today
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's, let's talk about short-term
and long-term benefits just like we did
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shorter term benefits of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the most low hanging fruit,
brain chemistry, mood, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of all the things that I tell
people, you know, you need to give CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: some time to do its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to mood, anxiety,
and stress, this is something that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you, you know, like within an hour,
depending on dose and your receptibility
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is, is because cannabidiol
stimulates the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you take it and it goes in and
activates it and your mood, your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry will start to even out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we talked at the top of the show,
in the first set, the main goal of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is to balance the
body's other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what's happening in this
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your chemistry has swung one way or
another, causing you to be either be
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed or anxious, CBD will help bring
you back to the balance place where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also an anti-mimetic, an anti-nausea
like THC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use them together,
they work together to be even more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then CBD binds to, they're called
TRIPV1 receptors, TRPV1 receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also function as ion channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these TRIPV1s are known to mediate
pain and inflammation and body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing that people are looking
to it for is to mediate pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD, of course, is handling the
experience of pain very differently than
[SPEAKER_00]: THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people put cannabis all in one
bucket on how it helps with pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that they don't really understand
the medicine very well because THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we've already learned, it helps by
being a natural analgesic and decreasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the muscle contraction as well as being a
distractant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CBD in its own way, it activates the
TRIPV1, which mediates the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of just like turns down the
volume of your experience of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, again, when you have CBD and
THC together, they work really well at
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing pain today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long-term benefits of CBD are
usually what people are going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often, the short-term benefits,
people are looking to THC for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may have heard CBD helps,
but realistically, CBDs most effective
[SPEAKER_00]: role is to strengthen the endocannabinoid
system so it can do its job, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the longer-term benefits of CBD
would be number one, first and foremost,
[SPEAKER_00]: to strengthen the endocannabinoid system
so it can do its job in rebalancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: various body's systems and the body can
heal itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs some more signaling
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD, because it targets these 165
different receptors, it has a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of help for all the different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a great thing to supplement
yourself with every day to strengthen your
[SPEAKER_00]: body's ability to take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD also exerts an anti-cancer effect as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't get too much into the
mechanics of it, but what it does is it
[SPEAKER_00]: has an anti-proliferative effect,
which means it slows down cancer's ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to replicate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you're taking it every day,
over time, you would have the CBD slowing
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase in number of the cancer
cells, and then you'd also have THC coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and bursting those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a very good team in this
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another great thing is that CBD
tends to kick off the body's housekeeping
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is helping take care of things
that, if allowed to go neglected over a
[SPEAKER_00]: long term, can get especially worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, when you take CBD,
it activates the PPAR gamma, which
[SPEAKER_00]: degrades the amyloid beta plaque in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this plaque builds up,
it is linked to the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you are taking CBD as a
prophylactic, like daily, just so things
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get bad or worse for you,
you are actually staving off a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of potential of Alzheimer's in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen patients that they're
starting to have dementia, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: start with a pretty heavy daily use of
CBD, and their dementia tends to calm
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both probably because of this PPAR gamma
activation, but also because CBD causes
[SPEAKER_00]: neurogenesis, the creation of new brain
cells, new neurons, especially the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are dopamine excreting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dopamine excreting neurons help
stave off things like Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really is helpful to use CBD on
a daily basis, probably for everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: since we know that just about everybody is
suffering from endocannabinoid deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially as you're getting older and
your body isn't working as well as it used
[SPEAKER_00]: to, and you're starting to forget things,
and you're starting to be more aware of a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential dementia or Parkinson's in your
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go too long without
supplementing your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can do the business of keeping you
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you really want to dive into
understanding CBD, the only place I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is ProjectCBD.org that I
mentioned at the top of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founder Martin Lee has put together an
exceptional cannabis resource for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, and it's the only online source
that I fully trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the articles are written in layman's
terms, and then they also provide direct
[SPEAKER_00]: links to the original scientific papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget ProjectCBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great, and as far as I'm
concerned, the only place to go online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a great deal of confusion and
debate about the proper dosing of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when using whole plant, we can offer
CBD milligram suggestions, but the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in the resin will always play
an uncontrolled role because we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how CBD might interact with the canaflavin
that is also in the resin and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be doing synergistically together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD in a whole resin goes further than
just a CBD isolate because it's got its
[SPEAKER_00]: partners in the resin, all the other
components of the resin there with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, CBD whole resin
will almost nearly always give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: better efficacious experience than just
isolate alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you don't have access to CBD
resin, or you can't afford it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that you need, by all means,
give a high quality CBD isolate a try and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if that will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so with that, let's talk some
specific numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back to 2015 when I was first
recommending CBD to patients, doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to take a position at all said
that about 10 milligrams per day of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant CBD was good, as a supplement that
would support a healthy person to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the actuality for healthy
people is probably twice that,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 10 milligrams twice a day, once in the
morning and once again after lunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the evening, because about 20% of
people find CBD stimulating and not
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating in a way of like coffee or
caffeine or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: more stimulating where when people take
the CBD, suddenly their body wants to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that housekeeping stuff, like removing the
plaque on the synapses in the brain and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up the mucus off the cilia in the
gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't really want to kick all
that stuff off as you are trying to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but that's only about 20% of
patients, but I don't recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: people take CBD in the evening unless
they've already had a trial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to do your trial like
on a work night or a school night or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it on a Saturday so that you make sure
that you're not reactive to CBD and making
[SPEAKER_00]: it more difficult to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you have something wrong,
that number of 10 milligrams twice a day
[SPEAKER_00]: will jump up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're actively working on an issue
like arthritic inflammation, migraines,
[SPEAKER_00]: IBS or something like that, you
immediately are going to want to jump up
[SPEAKER_00]: to more like 20 to 40 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will work on your endocannabinoid
system at a rate that you're likely to see
[SPEAKER_00]: something even maybe within a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always recommend a full month of
daily CBD as a trial because it does take
[SPEAKER_00]: your body some time to rebuild the
endocannabinoid system enough to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: meet your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know how many CBD receptors
that you have in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may take longer for your body to get
the reaction to the daily supplementation
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a month is it's not too long,
but it is enough, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've taken it for a month and you're
taking enough every day and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really seeing results at the end of the
month, well, you might as well put your
[SPEAKER_00]: money elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're dealing with something big
and chronic like rheumatoid arthritis or
[SPEAKER_00]: lupus or multiple sclerosis or just wicked
joint pain, the right answer for most
[SPEAKER_00]: people is probably to take as much as you
can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is so frustrating to patients
when I'm talking to them because if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got something serious and a whole
plant is expensive and sometimes hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: find, they're just all like, well,
how much do I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, well, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much can you afford?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a very frustrating answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to give them an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them an idea of how many milligrams
of CBD they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start doing the math and
they're like, oh man, that's half of a CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need that twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going through like one a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending where you are in the
country, those CBD syringes can be
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere between 30 and 80 bucks each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like the old days where in
many states, medical systems, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: were buying from the grower, there was
always a discount to people who had
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic illnesses, especially people who
were fighting cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by the time you're fighting
cancer, most people are broke when they
[SPEAKER_00]: find their way to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very challenging to recommend
CBD for people who need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps for some of those people,
a good solution will be to purchase CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant oil in a syringe and then
maybe even spike it with isolate to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have a chronic disease and I take
80 milligrams twice a day, but I grow my
[SPEAKER_00]: own and I make my own oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my costs are much lower than at a
licensed store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this again is why I'm a big proponent
of cannabis patient self-sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope that our society
continues to increase our support of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go on to the black swan
patients around CBD, I want to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like wrap up the numbers of dosing that I
was suggesting into a little nicer
[SPEAKER_00]: package, because I can imagine that it
might feel a little vague at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when I've all like take as much
as you can afford, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we essentially have got three different
levels of dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find out where your dosing may need
to be for your particular ailment,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I send you back to the Project CBD
site, because on projectcbd.org,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find the actual studies and you
can find out how much CBD they're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients, what their results were
like, and if they were using a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or an isolate preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because at this point, you understand
that the whole plant tends to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective than isolate, you can start to
kind of gauge where you your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: needs are for where you want to start your
dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start making your changes
after you see or don't see effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those three levels are, if you're
generally healthy and you want to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: that way, shoot for 10 milligrams of CBD
twice a day as a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford or get your hands on
more, well, that's all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the doctors that I have talked to and
interviewed say that if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually actively trying to fix something,
taking 10 milligrams twice a day for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams a day is a great place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next level up are if there is
something actively you're trying to work
[SPEAKER_00]: on, like your, like migraines,
like IBS, like arthritic inflammation in
[SPEAKER_00]: the arms or in your knees or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you're really talking about like
40 milligrams twice a day at that middle
[SPEAKER_00]: middle place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, there's this high end
where, if they're using 200 milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: doses in trials, not a lot of people can
afford 200 milligrams of whole plant CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even isolate CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just, you take as much as you
can and perhaps you can find yourself a
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe of CBD whole plant and then spike
it with some isolate and get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while that seems a bit on the vague
side, there's a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dozens of different ailments that
CBD can help with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't a show just about dosing
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to teach you how to think about how
to dose CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can continue with a little
bit more of your own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will provide a context for you to
put that new information in as you are
[SPEAKER_00]: designing your own protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so one note on black swan
patients around CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have worked with one immune
compromised patient who also had
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis and we become
delirious and experience missing time
[SPEAKER_00]: after simply ingesting 10 milligrams of
CBD in a whole plant cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really hard to believe it
unless I had seen it and I saw it a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that it wasn't very high in
THC in the oil because it was hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted and lab tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're certain that the THC
component was under one milligram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet something in this patient was
definitely activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on more than one occasion,
because the patient had a long history of
[SPEAKER_00]: using this same oil, suddenly when they
took the oil at this low amount of just 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, they were losing entire
afternoons and were kind of delirious and
[SPEAKER_00]: tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had to sleep the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talked to, you know,
cannabinopathic scientists, they they're
[SPEAKER_00]: skeptical and they don't want to believe
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been doing this a long time now
and I know the stuff to rule out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really tell you this to caution
you against CBD because CBD is so safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this is an extraordinarily
rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring it up in case you are a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come across a patient like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are incredibly varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing that something is possible,
even if rare, can help us guide patients
[SPEAKER_00]: should they have this sort of rare
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we close this CBD section,
it's worthwhile to mention that CBDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the acid and raw form,
unheated form of CBD that is present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant, also has a strong
affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: even more so than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And preclinical studies indicate that
CBD-A is also a potent anti-emetic or
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea, stronger than CBD or THC,
which also have the anti-nausea
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I dropped this in here
is just to kind of ignite the idea in you
[SPEAKER_00]: that while most of the preparations of
medicine that we have are not the acid
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, what is available to
us is CBD, not CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time we take THC, it's THC and
not THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to remember that the acid forms
that have not been decarboxylated or
[SPEAKER_00]: heated, they have their own sets of ways
that they help the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be shy about taking your
cannabinoids raw right from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, for example, by making hash and just
eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of using some kind of preparation
that you have to heat it, either by making
[SPEAKER_00]: an extracted cannabis oil, which you have
to heat to remove the ethanol or
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally smoking THC, where the
burning of it is the decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just valuable to understand that
these acid forms of these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: often have entirely different useful
properties than their non acid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the third one we're going to
cover in this set is is CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to cover this in a shorter
amount of time than THC and CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would say that the vast majority
of people who are here are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing recommendations for THC and CBD,
because those are the ones that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: studied the most and the ones that we can
get our hands on the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBG is now becoming increasingly
available ever since some CBG dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants found their way into the
market about five years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there are many hemp farms that are
growing CBG dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CBG is now available in isolate
form and as a whole plant resin too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must admit, I don't see CBG resin
available just anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to grow my own plants and make
it myself if I want it because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not available in the licensed
recreational system where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the newest cannabinoids to get
attention, and one with very specific new
[SPEAKER_00]: uses is CBG cannabigerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to delineate two specific
uses for CBG and then and then give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the dosing regime for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found when we did our research here
on Vashon Island three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we gave CBG to a round of patients
and then did a questionnaire afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: that the number one, the number one thing
that people responded to was that it
[SPEAKER_00]: helped neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pain from some kind of nervous
system damage or dysregulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a stabbing pain that seems without
cause or cold or numb fingers or limbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: that feeling of pins and needles,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially on your periphery,
right, the external parts of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people take CBG, it decreases
that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is true, we don't we don't exactly
know why yet, but we do know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens and it happens pretty consistently
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the some of the things that
cannabis help with, we have to very much
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, your mileage may vary,
but these two attributes in CBG seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty reliable across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the great things about CBG is
that it doesn't have intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it unless you are taking a CBG from a
plant that it's married to THC in the
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation, like like you don't grow a
CBG hemp plant, instead you you grow a one
[SPEAKER_00]: to one plant that's one part CBG and one
part THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're not intentionally
adding the THC component, CBG on its own
[SPEAKER_00]: won't get you high, which makes it very
reliable for lots of people who have pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't want to feel any level of
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBG is incredibly reliable for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second great use for CBG is actually
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really surprised when we got back
the questionnaires and there were there
[SPEAKER_00]: are multiple different flavors of anxiety
that people found great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help with so the first one was social
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said that it kind of like calmed
them down and allowed them to be social
[SPEAKER_00]: and interact with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also heard from people that it softened
performance anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So public speaking or at the beginning of
COVID when everyone was getting on zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings for the first time, you know zoom
meetings are very socially awkward
[SPEAKER_00]: situations and a lot of people found it
very uncomfortable to be doing these zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBG help people like cool out so that
they could tolerate the the awkwardness,
[SPEAKER_00]: stay calm and engaged and and be
productive in their zoom meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one was a real
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many patients would explain it to me by by
putting their their hands on their hips
[SPEAKER_00]: and thrusting their chest out like a
superhero would and and they'd say like it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me the confidence of a superhero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I heard that enough times I I
really had to start like listening and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it because people really
seem to get an increase of confidence from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and how they described it is I feel
like I feel like I have the resources to
[SPEAKER_00]: get what I need to get done today versus
you know if you wake up with rumination
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like oh my gosh I just don't I
just don't have what it takes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the day that can really just like
hold you back your entire day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start your day with a little
CBG and suddenly you're all like OK I can
[SPEAKER_00]: handle this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed up very significantly in the
questionnaires that we got back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also in the three years since
then I just I just see it in patients all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time when they when they tell me that
they have sourced it and they're using it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're loving it and they never want
to not have it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CBG can have a geral can be relied
on for as a really reliable anti anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: with no intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the specific numbers and milligrams
that that we're seeing people have success
[SPEAKER_00]: with 10 milligrams of CBG every three
hours does a great job for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to use it as a pain
reliever 10 milligrams of CBG every three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours does does usually has fantastic
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a very high background
anxiety you might need to take CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really for most folks they'll take it
in the morning and it kind of sets them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the on an anti anxiety path for the day
and they just seem to be like OK with that
[SPEAKER_00]: one dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if they have like a stress event in
the afternoon many people will take it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really unless you already have chronic
anxiety if you just like have a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety or if you have like morning
ruminations that you need to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get away with just taking 10
milligrams of whole plant CBG just once in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning and good for the rest of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know if your anxiety continues
throughout the day you can certainly take
[SPEAKER_00]: it as needed because taking more has got
no negative impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 20 milligrams makes it happen even
faster and with a bit more spunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that you know generally you
take 10 milligrams just because you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a high background anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today you need to give a presentation
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your your your anxiety is going to
be especially peaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then go ahead and take 20 milligrams
and and don't monkey around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are those are great low numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if you if you think back to the
THC we were talking you know 10 5 or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the CBD we were talking 80 and
200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is back down to THC levels more
like 10 or 20 milligrams and makes it much
[SPEAKER_00]: more affordable if you can find it because
the CBG that is available to you just
[SPEAKER_00]: lasts a whole lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap up this second set we looked at
the you know how to think about dosing for
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and for CBD and for CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted there are a lot of other
cannabinoids out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between the lack of availability in
most places and the lack of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: about what is an effective dose I don't
want to give you information that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: solidified yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so since these are the three
cannabinoids that most people have easier
[SPEAKER_00]: access to this is this is what we're going
to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as new cannabinoids become more
available in the future like for example
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN we're going to be seeing a lot more of
CBN soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when that comes you will have you
will have the proper understanding and
[SPEAKER_00]: context to look at the studies that are
coming out and being published on Project
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD dot org and learning how to add that
to your own particular health protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our short break and
when we come back with set three we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about some use cases like
arthritis and leg and joint pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy and and we'll just talk about
thinking through some of these use cases
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you really understand
how to think through doing your dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I've said everybody's dosing
in the end is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can give you these guides to get you
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end you will be divide devising
your own protocol as you get to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis medicine works and how it
works with your own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to a hundredth episode
of shaping fire and I am Shango Los
[SPEAKER_00]: without these advertisers shaping fire
would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let us know let
you know let them know you heard them on
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire as cannabis regulations
become more demanding and consumers become
[SPEAKER_00]: more educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is increasingly important to avoid the
use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copert has the beneficial insects mites
and nematodes microbials sticky cards and
[SPEAKER_00]: air distribution units.

[SPEAKER_00]: back, you are listening to shaping fire
episode 100 and I am your host Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in the third set,
the big wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set we learned about
how our endocannabinoid system functions
[SPEAKER_00]: and considered some of the different ways
to take cannabis medicine into your body
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what is going to be best to suit
the ailment that you are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set we talked about very
specific dosing strategies and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider dosing products and protocols for
the most popular three cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: people look to supplement with THC,
CBD and CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in set three which hopefully will
be shorter than the first two,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about one,
two, three, four, five, six specific
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that people come to me asking for
dosing strategies for and we'll go over
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of swiftly since you've heard
most of the analysis already earlier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to tie them together which
should kind of give you a roadmap to how
[SPEAKER_00]: you can think about them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right, let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one we're going to talk about
is kind of this bucket of issues which is
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritis, leg and joint pain and
neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that these all have in common is
that it is an ongoing chronic discomfort
[SPEAKER_00]: or pain most likely caused by
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though it manifests
differently in these different issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really do have a lot of similarity in
how we're going to treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if somebody came to me with one of
these, this is what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I would recommend a 2.5 to
five milligrams of THC if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: intolerant of THC or are especially
concerned about feeling out of control or
[SPEAKER_00]: high in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would also tell them that once
they built up a comfort with taking THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: if they already take THC, perhaps they are
a recreational toker or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go ahead and start with five to 10
milligrams if they are THC tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've built up a tolerance from daily
use, this number can go as high as 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams or more as we've already talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patients could probably benefit from
a tolerance break from the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that some patients cannot
live a day without THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not being cocky about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to say is if you can work it
out for a day or two or more to not take
[SPEAKER_00]: THC to bring your tolerance down from
needing to take 100 milligrams a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would probably be both physically and
financially of benefit to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing I would say here is to
consider a topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: With arthritis and leg and joint pain and
often neuropathy, you can actually use a
[SPEAKER_00]: THC based topical localized and targeted
to where the discomfort is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way you are taking
cannabinoids orally, which will help with
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic anti-inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when you place the topical
locally, you're doubling down on making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you're applying cannabinoids in
the proper area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are making your own tinctures and
you are aware that topicals are expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to just take some of your
tincture and a ramekin like they serve you
[SPEAKER_00]: ketchup in at the restaurant, go ahead and
put some kind of a hand lotion or a
[SPEAKER_00]: massage lotion or like lubricant or
something in one of those little ketchup
[SPEAKER_00]: ramekins, and then put just a little bit
of your tincture in it and swirled around
[SPEAKER_00]: with your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have made instant topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I used in the early days before
I learned how to make topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works absolutely fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can consider that and save a lot of
money on the kind of prices that they
[SPEAKER_00]: charge for topicals at the licensed
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quick run through of
arthritis, leg and joint pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cancer symptom relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not talking about the full fight
cancer protocol here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we'll do this again
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about the cancer fighting
protocol in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're talking about here is for
patients who have got cancer and are
[SPEAKER_00]: either simply just suffering from the
cancer and that's all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking for comfort or more
commonly, they've chosen to go the route
[SPEAKER_00]: of some variety of chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are dealing with the symptoms
from the chemo stacked on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: discomfort and from the cancer experience
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for these people, the first thing I
would recommend is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to help them in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing it's going to do is just
make them a little more comfortable in
[SPEAKER_00]: their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time cancer has gotten advanced and
especially if you are taking any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo, your human meat suit is just not
feeling like your ally anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got aches and pains and things
aren't working properly and fluids aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: moving properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just all around lack of comfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking five to 10 milligrams of THC
based tincture is going to put you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where you feel a little more
comfortable in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your muscles are a little more relaxed
instead of just being cleansed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're a little distracted from the
THC too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you haven't really changed the status
of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body is still incredibly
uncomfortable and sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can get a little bit of
respite just from the THC and the
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxation and the easing of your human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that THC is very likely to give you
an appetite as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, cancer patients,
especially in chemo, tend to lose their
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really don't want you thinning down
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to help you keep weight on
so that you don't slip into some kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting cycle because that's not usually a
good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have access to THCA, that's THC
that has not been heated or
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA is actually really effective in
cancer patients for helping rebuild
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case for you, THC is not appetite
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try the acid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of good results with that
here on the island ever since we started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a real positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing for cancer symptom
relief is to just simply take as much
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant CBD oil as you can afford,
as we discussed earlier, because your
[SPEAKER_00]: body's endocannabinoid system is probably
a wreck from all of the pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially if you are taking chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your body's natural balancing system
has been totally traumatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not properly making
signaling molecules and endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could really benefit from dumping
as much CBD into your body as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: likely afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I should put a top on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't put more than 400 milligrams of
whole plant into a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body probably couldn't process more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually don't have an opinion on
how much isolate is a maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially for cancer, I would really
recommend that you use a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation so that you're getting all the
secondary novel cannabinoids and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic components that we're not
entirely certain how they help out yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannaflavin and the others,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So migraines, they're kind of low-hanging
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It either works or it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the dosage is is pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's 20 milligrams of whole plant CBD
two times a day minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take more if you'd like,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 20 milligrams two times a day seems to
work pretty well for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once people realize whether or not they
are of the 20% of people who are kept
[SPEAKER_00]: awake at night by CBD because of it
activating the body's housekeeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not one of those 20%,
go ahead and take it in the evening too,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hopefully will act as a prophylactic
so you don't wake up in the morning with a
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be aware that if you are one of the
20% of people that CBD keeps up at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to avoid that because that
probably will increase your likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually waking up with a migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also would have you consider a small
number of THC for muscle relaxation
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that not only does a
relaxation of the muscle sets help
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the likelihood of migraines,
but if you are a pretty severe migraine
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, your body's fear of having
another migraine and going through that
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of pain and discomfort itself can
cause the body to constrict, which in and
[SPEAKER_00]: of itself can cause migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just feels bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not resistant to trying THC,
taking five milligrams of a THC tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the 20 milligrams of CBD will
likely help you either move out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: migraine or even better, be a
preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also have you consider microdosing
psilocybin mushrooms at 0.1 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take in 20 days a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to learn more about working
with your migraine using psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, I encourage you to listen to
Shaping Fire episode 67 with Dr. Russo,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we talk all about treating migraines
with cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one we're going to talk about is
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insomnia is incredibly common for me to
hear about because so many people have got
[SPEAKER_00]: it for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually pretty easy to treat
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I always ask people,
though, when they tell me that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: insomnia is not one that they generally
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that question is always, do you drink
coffee in the morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is the first thing to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The half life of the drug we call caffeine
is 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you are drinking tomorrow
morning's coffee, you are still on
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday's caffeine that you took in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is continuing every day,
you're never not on caffeine, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're trying to go to sleep at
night, you are always fighting against a
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulant that you took not only that
morning, but yesterday morning as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be the first place is to
stop drinking caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I would ask them what they think
their source of their insomnia or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insomnia tends to fall into two
categories, one being some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: discomfort or pain, and then the other
sort being some sort of anxiety or
[SPEAKER_00]: rumination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would suggest for them
solutions for the pain or the anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: rumination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oddly, they do tend to be both the
same cannabis prescription, which is five
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 milligrams of an indica tincture
made using purple flowering cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that the terms sativa and
indica are antiquated, but people are
[SPEAKER_00]: still using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be helpful when going to a
licensed store and talking with a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're looking for are tinctures
preferably made from plants from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, Pakistan region that are
purple, because these plants are heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic and lethargic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cause drowsiness and we want to
cause muscle relaxation, and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: slow you down and make you feel a little
dreamy and then put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these plants, these purple flowering
cannabis plants, they're usually packed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the terpenes myrcine and linalool,
which also help you feel drowsy and have
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, if the insomnia is caused by
anxiety and rumination, it would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: great to add some CBG tincture to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the person that you're working with
or yourself is THC intolerant,
[SPEAKER_00]: either on principle or they're sensitive
to it, you can just give them CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG helps with both pain and anxiety
rumination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking between 10 milligrams and 20
milligrams of CBG for insomnia is very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for folks, especially if they
are very much not interested in taking
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression would be 20 milligrams two
times a day of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking that because your goal is to
build up the endocannabinoid system and to
[SPEAKER_00]: help regulate the brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you want to do
long-term, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is not something that you're just
going to take Monday and then Thursday and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take CBD every day because the
benefits, the primary benefits come from
[SPEAKER_00]: building up your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making it burly so it can do its job
regulating your body's systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be 20 milligrams two times a
day, three times if you can take it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to put yourself in a good mood
and make things a little more tolerable
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're trying to change yourself
systemically, go ahead and try to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on some CBG tincture or oil as well
and take 10 milligrams of that twice a day
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning and then after lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That CBG, my goodness, is it an effective
anti-anxiety and it just makes things feel
[SPEAKER_00]: a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the confidence that it brings really
helps even out the depression vibes of
[SPEAKER_00]: hopelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would also recommend
microdosing psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microdosing psilocybin really helps
improve your neural network and pull you
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of research on it to support
it and I encourage you to check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: microdose psilocybin episodes on shaping
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one we're gonna talk about
here is neurodivergent support.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more people, especially during
quarantine, when our lives got less
[SPEAKER_00]: thrilling and we were creating less
dopamine from having relatively boring
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantined lives, a lot of people
realized that they have some flavor of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodivergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you figure that out,
by doing your reading and checking out the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodivergent community on TikTok,
I also recommend these as potential things
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you get through as you figure out
the best combination for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 milligrams of CBD whole plant oil two
times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of course because we wanna build
up that endocannabinoid system and we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanna give our brain as many signaling
molecules as it can to do its job because
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodivergent brains, they are running
hotter and faster than other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: brains and they need intentional support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not driving a regular car like
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're driving a formula one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And formula one cars, they need specialty
tires, specialty oils, specialty fluids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so do you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also helpful to keep things in a
good perspective by supplementing with
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 milligrams two times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is just simply it's hard
out there for neurodivergent folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This world was not designed for the
neurodivergent brain and that can get
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking some CBG, giving you that
confidence and a feeling that you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the resources to make it work,
it can really make your days more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also recommend 200 milligrams of
L-theanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is not a cannabis product,
that's for sure, but I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodivergent folks who run hot and
anxious find that L-theanine, 200
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of it, really evens out the
spiky parts of the day, the days where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get overstimulated or harshed out from
feeling over sensory inputted.
[SPEAKER_00]: L-theanine does a really great job taking
out the scratchiness of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you happen to be a person that's
into THC, well, having some THC tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: just to make you feel more comfortable in
your body, that can often feel strange to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, feel free to add five to 10
milligrams of THC as you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these six areas that I just swiftly
went through how I would think through
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing suggestions, I did this,
because I can't go through all the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody has.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is I wanted to give you a
couple pictures, a couple examples of how
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stack different cannabinoids along
with different entheogens like psilocybin
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms, along with occasional herbal
supplements like L-theanine, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: common sense like perhaps don't drink
coffee if you have insomnia, so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can figure out a stack for yourself that
meets your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do it the way other
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individualized medicine is a thing,
and your body is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so keep a journal, figure out what
works for you, and don't let your family
[SPEAKER_00]: or doctors push you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a strong advocate of patients'
rights, as everybody knows, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patient self-sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes and learn what's best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are still with us, thank you so
much for listening to this entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the longest shaping fire episode
that I have published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to get this all in one
document, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been thinking about this show and
working on notes for it for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have found the time to listen
to it for yourself, I congratulate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are listening to this because
you are a caregiver or someone you love
[SPEAKER_00]: uses cannabis medicine, well, I really
appreciate you too, because cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients need all the help and support and
love that we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like to learn more,
please peruse the first 100 episodes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Shaping Fire podcast and subscribe to
the show in your favorite podcast app.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many great episodes for
patients about patient health and for how
[SPEAKER_00]: to cultivate your own cannabis in a
healthy, inorganic, regenerative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a patient, maybe growing will be
your new hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend that you check out the
Shaping Fire YouTube channel, where there
[SPEAKER_00]: are nearly 200 videos of speakers from all
sorts of different conventions and such
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have attended over the years.
