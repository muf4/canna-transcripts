[SPEAKER_00]: Without a doubt, the most important group
of folks in the cannabis scene are the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am happy for everyone to have
better access to cannabis, but for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping defend patient access to clean and
legal cannabis and making sure they are
[SPEAKER_00]: educated in how to use it is my driving
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm not a doctor, because I
interview so many doctors and I bother to
[SPEAKER_00]: read the scientific papers that come out
about cannabis medicine, lots of folks
[SPEAKER_00]: approach me at cannabis conventions,
at the grocery, or even on the ferry back
[SPEAKER_00]: home to Vashon Island to ask for
suggestions in relieving their symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I have read something or
done an interview on a particular topic
[SPEAKER_00]: and have something helpful to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some topics I'm particularly deep on and
I'll teach those to small groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most asked about topics is
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's has become incredibly common
and there are a lot of good people getting
[SPEAKER_00]: bad information about how best to use
cannabis for Parkinson's relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're gonna fix that.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is cannabis researcher and
educator Zoe Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoe travels the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching groups and writing articles on
cannabinopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the former program director at
ProjectCBD.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: and is presently science editor at
Broccoli Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has built out educational content
focusing on scientific information about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for organizations like Pharma and
Groundworks Industries, Oregon Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences University, and Hudson Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sigmund has also testified about CBD and
cannabis regulation to the FDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and regularly speaks about cannabis and
cannabis science to patients, medical
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals, and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're gonna talk all about
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first set explains what Parkinson's
is, the second set explains how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: works in the human body to relieve
Parkinson's, and the last set is about
[SPEAKER_00]: proper dosing protocols and best practices
for using cannabis in real life
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to provide actionable
information for Parkinson's patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: those who love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Zoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Shango, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for giving us some of
your valuable time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're on the road, and I
appreciate you being with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Parkinson's disease and a handful of
similar afflictions are often put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: basket together because they share many of
the same causes and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start there to make sure that
we're all on the same page about what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna be talking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most prevalent visible symptoms
of advanced Parkinson's disease is the
[SPEAKER_00]: tremors, usually starting in one hand and
then unfortunately spreading from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the signs of Parkinson's
that people commonly become aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, the tremor really is the
first sort of noticeable physical sign of
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, at that point, the disease
is pretty far progressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really early signs that I have come across
are constipation and a loss of smell,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they're very subtle symptoms early.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really is sort of when the tremors
start that people start to think,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, maybe this is Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had not heard about the loss of sense of
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people, I think that they
go, oh, maybe that's a stuff nose or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's allergies or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or age, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know, by the time the tremors
have arrived, you've already lost so many
[SPEAKER_00]: dopamine creating brain cells that we're
already far down the path.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at that point, you've lost 60% of
the dopamine-producing neurons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually by the time people get to
cannabis, they have already... Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: is already part of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already been going to doctors for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a diagnosis and they are
weighing treatment at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to give symptoms short
shrift because we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the symptoms a lot more later on
when we're going to be talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can help relieve some of those
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we do a little more of a
review of what those symptoms are like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about them in two
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you first talk about the early,
maybe less recognizable symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talk a bit more about the ones
that we're more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the shuffling of the feet and bending
over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just for people who maybe are not
the Parkinson's patient themselves who are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, but maybe have a loved one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig into that a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the early symptoms,
and these are also secondary symptoms
[SPEAKER_04]: later in the disease progression,
are digestive issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not just constipation, but oftentimes
like nausea or loss of appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mood disorders are also common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is both... It could be an early
symptom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also where adults and people who are
getting older often have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: anxiety about getting older.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, it's not like a concrete way
to determine whether or not you have
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pain, sleeping issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all things that can be
indicative of Parkinson's disease early
[SPEAKER_04]: on, but they're also just common ailments
as we age with other conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's difficult to say if they're
directly connected to Parkinson's,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they are common in people with
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the disease progresses into the motor
symptoms, you of course get the tremors.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something called bradykinesia,
which is a slowed movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's this inability to consciously move
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's rigid muscles, impaired posture,
loss of the ability to control your
[SPEAKER_04]: movements completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like you have muscle
spasticity, you have tremors, all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: different involuntary movements are in
slightly different categories,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they can look pretty similar to people
who are not experiencing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the challenges,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things that everyone
recommends for Parkinson's is to start
[SPEAKER_00]: treating early, but so many of the early
symptoms could be so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swallowing problems and chewing and eating
problems and sleeping problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: constipation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different things can be causing
these, including like other medications
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may be on, because all this stuff
is side effects from other
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more often than not, the patients that
I have worked with, it is when the tremors
[SPEAKER_00]: start to arrive and you really have the
difficulty with motor function,
[SPEAKER_00]: tremors, the slight hunching over the
shuffling of the feet, because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get in a good step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhere in there that either they
or their spouse or a good friend points
[SPEAKER_00]: out, hey, do you know that you're doing
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when people start going,
oh, man, maybe this isn't just something
[SPEAKER_00]: from the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this as a package is something more
serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a really hard realization for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sort of at that point you can go
in and the doctor can test for some
[SPEAKER_04]: biomarkers of the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're already there, it's sort of
like, okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about more the underlying
what Parkinson's is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it gets gray real fast
because- Real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, real fast, because we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is common to be around with
Parkinson's groups and have people say
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's difficult for them to figure out
sometimes which of their symptoms are
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the Parkinson's and which of their
symptoms are coming from the Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often offer a delineation to
patients that it is not really as
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to try to determine which is
causing which.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like these things are a
package that start to show up at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same attributes that we use to
diagnose Parkinson's also cause these
[SPEAKER_00]: other symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very often difficult to figure
out which came first, the chicken or the
[SPEAKER_00]: egg, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which came first, the symptoms or the
Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you kind of get to the heart of
the matter and let us have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what the state of the
science is about what Parkinson's is and
[SPEAKER_00]: its cause to the best that we know so that
we can start teasing out symptoms from
[SPEAKER_00]: cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you are right to say that it
gets gray really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple of underlying causes
for Parkinson's disease neurologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's characterized by the loss of
neurons that produce dopamine in a
[SPEAKER_04]: particular part of the brain and therefore
a loss of dopamine in other parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: brain later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also marked by an accumulation of
these protein clusters called Lewy bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that really is sort of like a dead
end.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot about Lewy bodies out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sort of like here's a biomarker
of Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see an accumulation of this kind of
protein, this is associated with this
[SPEAKER_04]: disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, people and researchers
are focused on the dopamine aspect of the
[SPEAKER_04]: disease, the loss of dopamine,
how to prevent the loss of the neurons
[SPEAKER_04]: that produce dopamine, how to preserve
dopamine that's hanging out in your brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than that, the pathophysiology
is very gray.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really know what factors play
into the development of Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_04]: disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be environmental.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there are a couple of
symptoms neurologically that are
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with Parkinson's, but only
Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you were talking about earlier where
Parkinson's disease is included in a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of other neurodegenerative diseases,
those diseases are often associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: neuroinflammation, oxidative stress,
excitotoxicity, calcium channel
[SPEAKER_04]: dysregulation, a bunch of things in the
brain that show that something is not
[SPEAKER_04]: functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Parkinson's exhibits all of those
things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that actually brings us back to
this idea that Parkinson's and its kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: related ailments like lupus, Parkinsonian
syndrome, and the things that are all kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of often put in this basket, they're very
often diagnosed by symptoms instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in the body, which is
always strange, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other diseases like lupus is another one
of those, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wow, we don't know what it
is, but if you've got this basket of
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, we're gonna call it lupus so
that we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to distill what you just said down to
what I think is the essential kernel,
[SPEAKER_00]: the essential kernel seems to be that for
our conversation today, Parkinson's is the
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of neurons that create dopamine,
and it is the lack of the dopamine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dopamine serotonin cycle that starts to
cause the more serious aspects that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: more familiar with with motor and mobility
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oddly enough, during next set,
when we start talking more about how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis acts on Parkinson's, explaining
to patients that in essence, this bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: picture that is threatening their life,
it comes down to these dopamine-creating
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons in my experience, patients feel a
certain amount of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're glad for the clarity of purpose,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Parkinson's is kind of this big
amorphous thing that there are many
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions on, but when you bring it down to
this one thing, that you're losing these
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons and that's what is inhibiting your
life, patients tend to give me,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get this look of, there's like an aha
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, now I can kind of
focus on understanding this because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: named my monster and I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in those terms, it can be much easier
for someone to approach it to,
[SPEAKER_04]: because most of us have heard of dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you say, hey, this is what's
going on, people have something to grab
[SPEAKER_04]: onto.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then oftentimes I have found people
who have chronic illnesses like
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's disease become huge nerds
about their own condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's just, it's an incredibly
useful tool to say like, hey, here's one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the causes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we think is one of the causes
of Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're using Parkinson's disease as
the primary, let's say the flagship
[SPEAKER_00]: ailment in this basket, can you elucidate
a little bit what the other ailments in
[SPEAKER_00]: this basket might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've already mentioned Parkinsonian
syndrome, but honestly, that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: other one I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're often, I mean, Parkinson's disease
research is often done in conjunction or
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of lumped together with things like
Huntington's disease or multiple sclerosis
[SPEAKER_04]: or Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they all have different
pathophysiologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all, you can definitely tell in
the box in the body, in the brain that
[SPEAKER_04]: these are different conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as treatment and the underlying
causes, they're often discussed in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same sort of way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's specific research in each of those
areas, of course, but especially when you
[SPEAKER_04]: get into how cannabis interacts with these
diseases, they're frequently presented
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you are very hardcore about
keeping up on the up to the date research
[SPEAKER_00]: on a wide range of diseases that you're
very focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of research going on with
Parkinson's and cannabis right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, clearly there's more science going
on now with cannabis than there has been
[SPEAKER_00]: ever in human experience before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still technically, since cannabis is a
schedule one drug and illegal at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level, it's difficult to get
cannabis studies approved at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so clearly there's Parkinson's
research going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about Parkinson's and cannabis
research?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, I'm pretty impressed with
the amount of cannabis research that
[SPEAKER_04]: focuses on Parkinson's disease,
and it largely focuses on CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that as CBD has become more
and more legal, researchers are really
[SPEAKER_04]: latching onto it as a compound that could
be beneficial for a number of diseases,
[SPEAKER_04]: including Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, the evidence that cannabis
could be useful for Parkinson's has been
[SPEAKER_04]: around for a really long time,
like since the late 19th century,
[SPEAKER_04]: before Parkinson's disease was called
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was evidence that cannabis at that
point, cannabis indica, could help relieve
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the spasticity and shaking of the
condition that is now known as
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are older pieces of research
that focus on cannabis without being
[SPEAKER_04]: specific about the cannabinoid content or
THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also evidence coming out about
endocannabinoids, minor cannabinoids like
[SPEAKER_04]: THCV, CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these things are areas that
researchers are starting to look at from
[SPEAKER_04]: the perspective of Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is because Parkinson's is one
of the most common neurodegenerative
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases in our older population.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, there isn't really a
good treatment for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't medications at this point
that slow the progression of Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_04]: disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is really one or a very small
handful of medications that can treat the
[SPEAKER_04]: symptoms, but the disease will continue to
progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so researchers are really dead set on
trying to find compounds that can slow the
[SPEAKER_04]: progression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's why there's been
so much interest in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that you mentioned
that cannabis has been used for
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's before it was recognized as
Parkinson's going back 100 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you see these old antique
bottles of cannabis, you're reminded that
[SPEAKER_00]: historically cannabis has been some 70% of
the pharmacopoeia of what we humans used
[SPEAKER_00]: for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that cannabis being taboo is
only really something of the last 70 years
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though I must admit, it is crazy to
see some of the concoctions that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: these bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll throw cannabis and morphine and
cocaine in the same bottle, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is medicine and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, that will definitely
cure what ails you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this brings us up to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure most folks are most curious
about how can they actually use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat their Parkinson's and maybe roll
back its progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start that in a moment
for the second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and take our first short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is cannabis researcher
and educator, Zoe Sigman.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble with growing in new soils or
blended cocoa substrates is that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the plant's life just to create
these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's three times the concentration of
the current leading brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new product called Dynomyco is the
result of 30 years of research and trials
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Volcani Agriculture Research
Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since the product first arrived here last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have already even heard about
Dynomyco by its original name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Dynomyco is available at grow shops
and online in the United States for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of mycelium networks in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a biostimulant to make clone
cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco at
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco.com and find out where you can
get yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots or if you want to add some zinc,
[SPEAKER_00]: to tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you know that Shaping Fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_00]: found on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attend conventions or speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Joudry of Wonderland Nursery talking about
breeding cannabis for the best terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative
and polyculture cannabis growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agrawal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben Cassidy of True Terpenes on using
terpenes for health in your everyday life,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gaudino of Steep Hill on the
cannabis genome, and Jeff Lowenfels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, and even my own
presentation on how to approach finding
[SPEAKER_00]: your dream job in cannabis and why we
choose cannabis business even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: risks are so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there are over 100 videos
that you can check out for absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to youtube.com forward slash Shango Los
or click on the link in this week's
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb Inspekta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb, also known as Inspekta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were here on Vashon Island,
and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our guest this week is cannabis
researcher and educator, Zoe Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is a long history of being
used not only to relieve the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's, but also rolling it back
because of the cannabis plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause neurogenesis, the creation of new
brain cells that produce dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we talk about how cannabis can
help in the short term with symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's abatement, how about we start
with your explanation of how cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: help combat Parkinson's long-term by
revitalizing the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: and making more of these neurons that are
so important?
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a couple of parts to that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as cannabis and neurogenesis,
this is an area that is of great interest
[SPEAKER_04]: to researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We start seeing how neurodegeneration can
be caused by things like
[SPEAKER_04]: neuroinflammation, oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are like basically little
compounds that float around wreaking
[SPEAKER_04]: havoc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabinoids have been shown to combat
those underlying causes of
[SPEAKER_04]: neurodegeneration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by being anti-inflammatory,
by being an antioxidant, cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_04]: able to help preserve your brain's ability
to create new neurons, which is incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: important as we grow and change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like our brains suddenly
completely stop creating new neurons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of being alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in people with Parkinson's disease,
you see that neurogenesis take a nosedive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you can do anything to prevent
the underlying causes of
[SPEAKER_04]: neurodegeneration, you're doing something
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there've been all these individual
studies in rodents and in cell cultures
[SPEAKER_04]: that show that THC and CBD and CBD can
help retain neuronal health in a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is both preserving or protecting
from oxidative factors and also preserving
[SPEAKER_04]: things like synaptic plasticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cells have life cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important that they complete
the entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Parkinson's disease and other
neurodegenerative diseases interrupt that
[SPEAKER_04]: life cycle in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid
system are responsible for regulating
[SPEAKER_04]: those life cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so manipulating the endocannabinoid
system can help reestablish or preserve
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the ability for cells to have a
more normal life cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The endocannabinoid system is a promising
therapeutic target in a number of ways for
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has to do with its relationship to
the dopaminergic system, so the system
[SPEAKER_04]: that produces dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is sort of like a cutting edge of
research that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like anandamide, which is one of
the cannabinoids that our bodies produce,
[SPEAKER_04]: an endocannabinoid, is vital in the cycle
of creating dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's integral in healthy adults.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in Parkinson's, people who have
Parkinson's disease, we see a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: impacts on the endocannabinoid system,
depending on the stage of the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in people who are sort of
pre-symptomatic before they have the motor
[SPEAKER_04]: issues associated with Parkinson's
disease, we see a depression of the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are lower levels of
endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: receptors, which makes researchers think,
like, huh, something is going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potentially like this system could be a
target for therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as the disease progresses to the
intermediate and advanced stages,
[SPEAKER_04]: start to see those motor symptoms,
you get an overexpression of
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thought is it could be a
compensatory reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something has happened in the early stages
of the disease that causes the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system to under-express,
which allows things like oxidative factors
[SPEAKER_04]: and inflammatory factors to proliferate in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that makes the disease progress more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as it progresses, the
endocannabinoid system sort of like snaps
[SPEAKER_04]: back up and starts over-expressing all of
these things, which is actually kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: good because anandamide, it's been shown
that when you do things, chemically,
[SPEAKER_04]: that make anandamide stay around longer,
you're also making dopamine stay around
[SPEAKER_04]: longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you kind of want more anandamide
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're preserving whatever dopamine
your brain is still producing if you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets a little technical,
but yeah, there are many reasons why the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system is a target for
therapeutic promise in Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis and the endocannabinoid system
are obviously deeply interrelated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting is in a lot of
therapeutic settings and in Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_04]: disease, there's evidence basically
suggesting like the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_04]: is much larger than we currently accept it
as being.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most people will characterize the
endocannabinoid system as consisting of
[SPEAKER_04]: these two receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_04]: The endocannabinoids our bodies produce
and the enzymes that synthesize and break
[SPEAKER_04]: down those endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we see that plant cannabinoids and
endocannabinoids interact with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: different receptors in our body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these receptors could be very
important in helping to mitigate some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the effects of Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them are orphan receptors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, actually very recently,
CBD was sort of in the Parkinsonian
[SPEAKER_04]: research news as being beneficial because
it interacted with an orphan receptor
[SPEAKER_04]: called GPR6.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was an inverse agonist,
which means it makes the receptor do the
[SPEAKER_04]: opposite of what it usually does,
which is good because activating the
[SPEAKER_04]: receptor causes an increase in
Parkinsonian symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And CBD, by making it do the opposite,
caused a decrease in those symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you start to see very specifically
all of the effects that different
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids could have on all these
different receptors that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial or not beneficial for
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's unpack a little bit of
this because it is complicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your explanation is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also know that when I publish
episodes that are about specific diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases or ailments, we attract new
listeners who have come just for this one
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first thing I want to do is I want
to address the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I usually explain it to
non-cannabis crowds is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is what keeps the
human body in homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps everything in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the second grade teacher
in a classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the second grade teacher is in
the classroom, the kids are generally
[SPEAKER_00]: well-behaved and doing what they're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the teacher goes outside of the
room into the hallway, eventually one
[SPEAKER_00]: kid's gonna crack up and then another
kid's gonna crack up and then different
[SPEAKER_00]: kids crack up first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually though, it's chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what happens with the
endocannabinoid system as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the endocannabinoid system,
once it becomes weakened, perhaps this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular body system starts working less
well and then another one is less well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we start getting oxidation or
inflammation because our body is not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: its general house cleaning that keeps the
body in homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since these cannabinoids that we're
talking about, which naturally occur
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the human body as endogenous
cannabinoids, meaning produced inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: body, we turn to cannabis for
phytocannabinoids because we can get them
[SPEAKER_00]: from a plant and they do the same thing,
which is signal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These cannabinoids are being used to
signal, to turn switches on and off in
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the body, which is
essentially doing this homeostasis work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a dearth of these
cannabinoids and our body is not producing
[SPEAKER_00]: them, the switches cannot get turned on
and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's as if the second grade teacher is
leaving the room and the kids start to act
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is when these, this particular set
of kids, if you will, that you have just
[SPEAKER_00]: described, when it's these kids that stop
working in the brain, the ones that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's symptoms, this is why we wanna
treat Parkinson's with cannabis because we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give the body the communication
tools to turn these switches on and off
[SPEAKER_00]: and essentially act like the second grade
teacher in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you buy that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how a lot of researchers look at
finding compounds to treat conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with the cells?
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do to make the cells do what
they normally do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is true of Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: The primary treatment for Parkinson's
disease is levodopa, which is a precursor
[SPEAKER_04]: to dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically researchers were like,
okay, people aren't producing enough
[SPEAKER_04]: dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get these symptoms that are related
to Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: This medicine can help brains produce more
dopamine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very similar with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the endocannabinoid system is not
functioning properly, not producing
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoids or receptors,
how do you make it do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you introduce a compound that
interacts directly with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting about THC,
which is the primary plant compound that
[SPEAKER_04]: interacts with TB1 and TB2, the sort of
best known receptors in the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system, is it could
actually jumpstart the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: system if it is underperforming.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a theory put forward by Dr.
McPartland and Guy, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: five years ago, which is sort of like
there might be a clinical endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: deficiency that's responsible for a number
of conditions, and taking THC could sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of snap everything into place.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side of it, chronic use of
THC downregulates the CB1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_04]: which doesn't really seem to be much of an
issue for chronic cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is completely theoretical at this
point, so please, this is just from me
[SPEAKER_04]: reading research, everyone listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Parkinson's disease in its later stages
is characterized by an overproduction of
[SPEAKER_04]: CB1 receptors, perhaps finding a way to
downregulate those receptors could help to
[SPEAKER_04]: restore some balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting and novel approach I
have not heard, but yeah, that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting idea, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think would be
worth teasing out here a little bit is so
[SPEAKER_00]: far, you and I have been talking kind of
generally about this basket of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we're going to take from
the cannabis plant, and somehow these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids support this endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important to make sure
people understand that these various
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids each have their own job,
which is one of the reasons why it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important to take whole plant
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just take a cannabinoid
isolate, like pure CBD crystal or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, because that is not
treating the whole endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what our goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll know the specifics on these
better than me, but to get us going on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, THC is an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD increases the number of signaling
molecules to turn on and off these
[SPEAKER_00]: switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, while it decreases the experience of
neuromuscular pain, it also offers
[SPEAKER_00]: patients the confidence to feel that they
can overcome the stresses that their
[SPEAKER_00]: body's under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of these cannabinoids,
taking one on its own doesn't get us where
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fact that all of these different
cannabinoids, including the ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have not even figured out exist yet,
these different cannabinoids, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: work together in concert, they are
rehabbing our body's basic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them into homeostasis,
which by definition will be decreasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying lack of dopamine that we call
Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting to look at
bringing this back to Parkinson's too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we're still really figuring out
what causes Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also still figuring out what we can
do to make it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sometimes it's like you have to do
three things at once to make the symptoms
[SPEAKER_04]: of Parkinson's disease decrease.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good example of that is in a rodent
model, they had a CB1 antagonist,
[SPEAKER_04]: so something that blocked the effects of
CB1, and they also had a FAA inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had a compound that basically made
anandamide, the endocannabinoid that our
[SPEAKER_04]: body produces, stay around for longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they blocked CB1, made anandamide stick
around longer, and saw a decrease in
[SPEAKER_04]: symptoms associated with Parkinson's
disease in rodents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like you're looking at at least
three different targets in that model,
[SPEAKER_04]: P bar gamma, CB1, and then the FAA
inhibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was only when all of those things
were together that you saw the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just combining these things can be
very, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not what Western medicine is used
to doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of it, each one of those
compounds have many molecular targets in
[SPEAKER_04]: the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just THC will do this one thing
because it interacts here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like THC does lots of things because
it interacts everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So does CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's exciting, but it also really
pisses off a lot of patients and their
[SPEAKER_00]: families when you're trying to explain,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Western medicine is so
reductionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to hear that the disease is
caused by A, and we take B, which undoes
[SPEAKER_00]: A, end of story, put it in a pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, not only is that not really
how nature or our bodies work,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is definitely not how cannabis medicine
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis medicine is more about here
is a broad range of naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical compounds that our body normally
makes, but it's not making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to get it from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we put them in our body,
dozens of little chemical reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, which when you put them together
becomes a melody that decreases the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of disease and potentially the
disease itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people do not want to hear that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, I'm having trouble
sleeping, but I don't want to feel high
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't want to feel altered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, what's good for
sleeping?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's good for pain?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like, well, let's walk
you through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't really tease apart symptom
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: But based on cannabinoids alone,
like you're not necessarily going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the same pain relieving qualities from CBD
as you do from THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take THC, it could be really
good for pain, but you might feel high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not this completely custom
formed pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a plant that produces a lot of really
interesting compounds and it does a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: things all at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes that's good and sometimes
it's bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Parkinson's, so much of the
research about THC has been incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: contradictory because CB1, while it's
apparent that it plays a role,
[SPEAKER_04]: activating it has had like very
contradictory results.
[SPEAKER_04]: So activating CB1 can cause an increase in
symptoms or a decrease in symptoms,
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of depending on the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blocking CB1, same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obvious that manipulating CB1 has an
impact on this disease, but we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: entirely sure what.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has an impact on both the disease
and the side effects of the most common
[SPEAKER_04]: medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tremors are a hallmark of Parkinson's
disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also a hallmark of the side
effect of levodopa, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: this shaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Involuntary muscle movement that develops
in like 30 to 50% of people who take this
[SPEAKER_04]: medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so CB1 activation seems to help the
shaking associated with taking levodopa,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it might not help the shaking
associated with the disease itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually not the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually somebody in the patient's
family who will send me an article usually
[SPEAKER_00]: not a scientific paper, but just some
article that they saw on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how THC in, you know,
lab rat studies sometimes can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the markers for Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, my family member
should absolutely not be taking something
[SPEAKER_00]: that increases the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, you say,
you know, you got to tell me like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, you are myopically looking at this
one study, which we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand its meaning yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't done in humans, but perhaps
that study is going to be outweighed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that, that, you know,
cannabinoids cause neurogenesis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: creation of more dopamine, um,
creating neurons and the, the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory aspects of THC makes the
body feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the muscle relaxation aspects of it
decrease the tremors and the CBG increases
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient's confidence and decreases the
neuromuscular pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, you're like, okay,
you know, plant medicines are complex and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to look at, at how you are
going to treat the human in a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: broad, holistic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always feel bad for, for these
families because, um, this is the not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best time of their life to be learning
detailed medicine that they're totally
[SPEAKER_00]: unfamiliar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you gotta, you gotta walk them
through this stuff very slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: lovingly so that they can feel empowered
to make decisions for themselves or their
[SPEAKER_00]: family members at the same time,
um, that they are being incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's totally understandable
that they're frustrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want an easy solution and this isn't
an easy solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a very powerful one,
but it's definitely not easy and it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it is asking a lot to,
to sort of introduce people to this
[SPEAKER_04]: concept that it, it's going to take time
to figure out whether or not something
[SPEAKER_04]: works or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in general, I mean, in the human
studies that have been conducted on THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and CBD and people with Parkinson's,
they're, it's by and large, there've been
[SPEAKER_04]: no worsening of symptoms, you know,
at worst, usually it's like nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that's the worst case scenario,
why not try it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the best case scenario can be
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could help cease some of the
involuntary muscle movements.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can make people happier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, quality of life is huge
and that's a stunning effect of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid therapy sort of across the
board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if people don't observe any sort of
metaphysical manifestations of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: therapy, they feel better and that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like your point that,
you know, nothing may happen at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're really only risking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of the time, not most of
the time, every Parkinson's patient that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever, you know, become familiar with
and taught a dosing protocol to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they fall into one of three categories,
either category one, for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't seem to have any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're frustrated by that and that
sucks, but you know, that's the nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes that's basket one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basket two are people who are able to
relieve their daily symptoms to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree and maybe all the way, which can be
like a huge win, but the Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to progress over time and
they're not able to turn the tide on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the third category,
which is always delightful to run into
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're very responsive to
cannabinopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their daily symptoms decrease right away
and their treatment of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system causes their body to start creating
more neurons that create dopamine on the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body's own and then the body's
endocannabinoid system fires up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's rolls back and their test
numbers become better and everybody is
[SPEAKER_00]: astonished for the miracle cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and then of course we hope
that everybody's in that category,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really I haven't come across a patient
yet who experimented with cannabis and it
[SPEAKER_00]: made them worse except for it's worth
mentioning people who start taking THC
[SPEAKER_00]: without following a specific dosing
protocol can accidentally over medicate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and get more high than they're
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be, you know, an hour or two
of displeasure or, you know, more often
[SPEAKER_00]: than not people who are the age that
people generally get Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that those people more go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than have a paranoid experience,
but you know, it is something worth
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like because, you know, once you're high,
one of the classic hallmarks of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cannabis intoxication is a loss
of the ability to balance in the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since people with Parkinson's already
have, are sort of compromised in their
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to balance, that can be
definitely, I've experienced patients who
[SPEAKER_04]: got really scared because they lost their
balance when they were high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's like, yeah, totally
understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it has to do with, you know,
that's too much, you know, you could take
[SPEAKER_04]: less definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've run into actually many
Parkinson's patients who are very
[SPEAKER_04]: sensitive to THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could have to do with the
expression of CB1 in their cerebrospinal
[SPEAKER_04]: fluid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have more targets for that THC
to hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe they're getting high faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, I had one patient that I was
working with and that was her primary
[SPEAKER_00]: complaint was that when she would take
some purple flower THC in the evening
[SPEAKER_00]: before bed as a tincture, so that she
could get a good night's sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, maybe two,
two and a half hours, she would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: get up to use the restroom and the THC was
in her body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she felt a little unstable going to
the restroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, I said, you know,
that is a thing for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, let's decrease your
dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, uh-uh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, and she said, I just put
a, like a bar on the wall and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: railing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, I added a railing between my
bed and the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hold onto that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, because it's so important for
her to take THC at night at that dosage so
[SPEAKER_00]: that she wakes up in the morning hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all like, my gosh, see,
this is, this is next level patient self
[SPEAKER_00]: care where they have learned how the
cannabis medicine works for them uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was causing, you know,
she was getting individualized medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: after she learned how to properly use the
tincture for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just need to be patient through
those first couple of weeks of learning
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use the medicine best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take the advice from,
you know, your doctor or somebody like you
[SPEAKER_00]: or I and adapt it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got like best practices for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the, you know, gold standard
for using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is, I mean, it's, it's a lot of
experimentation and it can take a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, having patients can really
turn out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to commercial,
I want to talk about the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: To relieve short-term symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've already touched on a bunch of
this, but, you know, generally up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: now we've been talking about, you know,
fighting Parkinson's as the disease to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of it, you know, to get rid of
the underlying lack of dopamine issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for many folks,
the initial cessation or lessening of
[SPEAKER_00]: physical symptoms that gives them their
first confirmation of hope in cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking a little bit that a friend
gives them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, many of us have seen the
internet video of a Parkinson's patient
[SPEAKER_00]: with significant tremors being given just
a tiny bit of cannabis oil on their
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like within four or five minutes,
those tremors are gone and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting and, you know, their friends,
they're, they're crying and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful, you know, videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, there's plenty of
these on YouTube that people can check
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that happen in person with a
patient, it really is breathtaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk about like the
short-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: What symptoms have you seen abated with
cannabis in the short-term?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say short-term, I mean like you
take some tincture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently, let's say every three or
four hours and the symptoms go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to some degree within a day and
then more so day two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very swift response.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally tremors, pain, sleeplessness,
appetite, all of those things I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: return in Parkinson's patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really improves their quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, when, when patients are
eating properly because they've got their
[SPEAKER_00]: hunger back and they're getting a proper
night's sleep, it's helping the underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic issues that are going on for
them, because none of us are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive with crappy food and crappy sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the quality of life shoots up
remarkably.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The anxiety and depression is such a big
issue for everyone who lives with chronic
[SPEAKER_04]: disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you can manage that with
cannabis, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we get back from the commercial,
we're going to get right down to specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dosing protocols and methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're going to take our
second short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Cannabis Researcher and
[SPEAKER_00]: Educator, Zoe Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking
over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine-grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_00]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many greenhouse operators though,
building their greenhouse before gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into how cannabis greenhouses
differ from ornamental crops can be the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Brandstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Brandstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_00]: build and equip their greenhouses for over
a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to overcome them in epic episode
number 41 of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_00]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some it is improper ventilation
planning, for others it is surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of the building or the
plant's leaves or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_00]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where the greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_00]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Eric Brandstad over his years of
working with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit GreenhouseAdvisoryGroup.com to learn
more and connect with Eric and his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you already have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're not ready to hire somebody
full-time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new candidate
for a cannabis company or an established
[SPEAKER_00]: company moving from medical to adult use
in your state, Kirsten especially can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-reversed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and Humboldt at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website, and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time, they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I have
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper, because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting-edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis connects people and creates
opportunities for new friendships.

cannabis-themed jewelry, money clips,
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling trays, and home furnishings that
you love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also make great gifts,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ashley Villafranca, owner of the Tok
Shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came to Cannabis as a patient seeking an
alternative to the pharmaceuticals being
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed at me for chronic pain and
fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that not only was Cannabis a
huge help in controlling my symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I found Cannabis to be wonderfully
social, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis makes friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took my love of jewelry design and
blended it with my newfound passion for
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and began hand-crafting
bracelets, earrings, and friendship
[SPEAKER_01]: necklaces, and then expanded to money
clips, rolling trays, and other home
[SPEAKER_01]: furnishings, all made in sterling silver,
14-karat gold, and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something for everyone's
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider it all to be new age Cannabis

[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Cannabis researcher and
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, Zoe Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are at the part of the show
that a lot of people have been waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for, I am sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to go through specific dosing
protocols to get you started with using
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis to help treat your Parkinson's
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, historically, Parkinson's
patients have been recommended to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a, air quotes, two-to-one of 10
milligrams of CBD and five milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC every three to four hours,
which is about the amount of time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids stay active in the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: While a reasonable place to start,
even this basic dosage protocol,
[SPEAKER_00]: though, has definitely has room for
customization, especially if the patient
[SPEAKER_00]: has never tried Cannabis before,
I wouldn't want to start them out at five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zoe, when you are consulting a new
patient, where do you like to suggest that
[SPEAKER_00]: they start with their Cannabis dosing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I generally suggest that they start
lower than five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two and a half milligrams is a pretty
good place to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even then, I have had people with
Parkinson's disease say that that was
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty significantly altering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if people are nervous about the
feeling of being high, start with one
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd still say at least 10 milligrams of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can basically take as much CBD as
you're comfortable with taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of information about CBD for
Parkinson's patients, clinical studies and
[SPEAKER_04]: observations that show dosages really up
to 600 milligrams of CBD have been shown
[SPEAKER_04]: to have benefit in various aspects of the
disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the THC is concerned,
we really want to avoid people feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so two and a half milligrams,
one milligram, if you're really nervous,
[SPEAKER_04]: the first time you take Cannabis medicine,
we really hope that you don't feel
[SPEAKER_04]: anything because that means you can
increase your dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also means that there are very,
very rare people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had Cannabis researchers suggest to
me that maybe it's one in 10,000 people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have a severe reaction to THC,
where they'll take a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: it of two and a half milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will have an outside response to
it and get really high for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is incredibly rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only come across one person in
all of my years talking with Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who is that sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's you or if it's a family
member, or if you're a caregiver,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to be the one that finds
that rare patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the patient does not have an
experience with THC, starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly small, what regular Cannabis
patients would consider laughable,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with those laughable amounts
really is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more about method later,
but this is one of the reasons why I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like tinctures for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're smoking, you can't
control your dosage at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking a concentrated oil,
it's really hard to get low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're taking capsules,
you're stuck with whatever's in that
[SPEAKER_00]: capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are taking a tincture,
you can take a full dropper, you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: a half a dropper, or you can just take
three little drops, whatever is convenient
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how we would get to,
as you suggested, a 2.5 milligram THC
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if the person hasn't had any at all,
maybe just give them 10 drops,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to make...
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to do the math based on what it
says on the bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just say that 10 drops is going
to be one milligram, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start there because you can
always increase your dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's in your body, it's much harder
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so doing a healthy self-titration of
moving up until you find your sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: is really a way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zoe, how do you recommend people find
their sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they know when they've hit
their sweet spot of the right amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC to take?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it varies from person to person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that a really good metric that
I've used for a long time is basically you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to feel relief of your symptoms
without any unwanted side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could mean different things for
different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some people, maybe you're looking for
a lessening of pain, but you don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: feel high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you would continue to slowly
titrate up to the place where maybe you've
[SPEAKER_04]: been feeling pain relief in some way for a
little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, you hit a dose where
you're like, oh, I feel high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So move back down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's always a really good idea to keep
track of exactly how much of any cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine you're taking and then sort of
recording what your experiences are on
[SPEAKER_04]: that medication or at that dosage level so
that if you hit a point at which you're
[SPEAKER_04]: uncomfortable, you can back it down to the
last step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to point out that it isn't
like if you add one more drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go from not feeling it to being like
super stoned, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a progression of not
feeling anything, not feeling anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you had a couple sips of wine
amount, and then maybe you had a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: amount and then, oh, maybe you actually
had a martini intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, maybe now you're kind of
slapping at light switches or grasping at
[SPEAKER_00]: the doorknob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're really high, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this range that so long as you
start on the low end, you can tiptoe your
[SPEAKER_00]: way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have found is that there are
many, many Parkinson's patients who tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me that they don't want to feel high and
they're afraid of feeling high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll titrate in one milligram,
two milligram, three milligram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then somewhere around four milligram
when they start to actually feel anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all like, oh, I really like the
warm sensation that I get from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at five or six, they're all like,
oh, I really enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes my TV much more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had laughs last night, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, unless somebody is
very familiar with cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: there really isn't any reason for a novice
to really go much beyond five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams unless they are experienced and
unless there is either they've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of resistance that they've built up
over time or if they're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant pain component and they want
to take a lot more THC to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just getting your legs under
you and learning about using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: your Parkinson's, generally speaking,
you don't really have much business going
[SPEAKER_00]: above five until you know what you're
doing because anywhere above five,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have a surprised over medication
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're an established cannabis
patient though, you know, pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: anything under 10 is going to be pretty
safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's okay to play with even more
than that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely sort of what you feel and
if it's effective and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people do build THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're using it every day,
you might need to increase your dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you go above 10, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on your body and what you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the kicker,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not scary so long as you have built
up the experience to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's plenty of cannabis
patients that are taking a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC and an edible at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's not their first time
taking cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are patients that have learned how
cannabis works with their body and they
[SPEAKER_00]: learned how to do it and when to do it and
they're very experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the vast majority of people who
are coming to cannabis, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our work on THC is going to be done
under five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, generally speaking,
as much whole plant CBD as you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a shame that it has to be that
way because you know, the cheap stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the affordable CBD is very often
questionably made, isolate from other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are not going to give you the
benefits of entourage effect and really
[SPEAKER_00]: working with the whole system of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant preparations, they're more
arduous to make and you know, their prices
[SPEAKER_00]: generally reflect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thankfully they seem to be more
effective or as effective at lower doses
[SPEAKER_04]: as CBD isolates at higher doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can play around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that it is beneficial for
almost everyone to take a pretty large
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of CBD at some point in their life,
as long as you're not on medications that
[SPEAKER_04]: stress your liver.
[SPEAKER_04]: And see what it's like and then sort of
start to understand what different amounts
[SPEAKER_04]: of CBD can give you as far as benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, in Parkinson's
patients, there's been a ton of human
[SPEAKER_04]: observations about like CBD improving
quality of life, spasms, sleep quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: like all of these issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, it's anywhere from 40
milligrams per day up to 600 milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually like a lot of the studies are
at around 150 milligrams, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot when you're thinking about how CBD
is usually sold, how much CBD is usually
[SPEAKER_04]: in a tincture bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just to say like, if you can
afford it, if you can find like a high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality preparation, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's unfortunate too,
because so many of the products on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves in licensed stores, they will make
an extraction of a THC plant and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: will spike it with CBD isolate so that
they can get like huge CBD numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not really a whole CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so often people, you know,
I will often recommend that taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost off the table for a minute,
if they can afford it, go ahead and start
[SPEAKER_00]: with their 2.5 milligrams of THC,
but plan on five milligrams, a dosage to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can take 10 to 20
milligrams of whole plant CBD with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four times a day so that you end
up with, you know, between 60 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred milligrams of whole plant CBD,
and, you know, 15 to 20 milligrams of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out over the whole day,
you're gonna very likely see a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're giving a healthy dose
consistently throughout the day and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are rebuilding your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just because some of the studies
that we've seen are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 milligrams an up in day, many of these
studies are still being done on rats and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dosing does not always- Well,
actually, in the CBD studies in
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's, it's in humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's really impressive about
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a bunch of preclinical stuff
in rats, like really interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: with CBD, but the dosages I was talking
about, those are all based on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so then my follow-up to that
would have been, since you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with these studies, are they
always using whole plant or are they using
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excellent question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That information is almost never provided.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so it's interesting,
you know, people will often get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, poor or no results on a few
hundred milligrams of CBD isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you give that same patient 25
milligrams of whole plant and,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my gosh, suddenly it works because the
body knows how to deal with that instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of just giving it an isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quality questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like in CBD isolate, in the world
of CBD isolate, you're a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: susceptible to fraud, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people just mislabeling what's
in the bottle and misrepresenting what's
[SPEAKER_04]: in the bottle, and you do need to be
careful about who you buy your products
[SPEAKER_04]: from for that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's regulating this, and so you need
to trust the person who makes the oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: the person who grows the flower,
the flower that goes into the oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit more of an involved process
than other medications, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another place that patients get super
frustrated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, there's so many places
for things to go wrong on the path from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant being in the ground to being in
your hands at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's potential pesticides
that are being used at the grower's step,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you've got some extraction
methods are better than other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm a big fan of ethanol extraction
because it really pulls out the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't get ethanol, you know,
I would probably go and try some CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, though that is not my personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always go to the ethanol first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can come all the way down to
people using distillates and isolates and
[SPEAKER_00]: spiking a THC cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most patients are not going to be
sophisticated enough to be able to unravel
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they go to a store and they
ask a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some epic bud tenders who,
you know, it's more than a job for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing their research at home and
they're going to conventions and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the minority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often than not, the bud tenderer
will give you what they have a lot of in
[SPEAKER_00]: stock or what other people tend to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of those are based on medical
efficacy, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the main problems of cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, getting a consistent product
that you can trust contains what you think
[SPEAKER_04]: it contains and making sure that that
product works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit on it a little bit earlier about
the different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so common for me to come across
patients who are first trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody gives them some joints to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly there are, you know,
some ailments that smoking is very
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, depression, glaucoma,
pain, loss of appetite, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these types of things, you know,
certainly, you know, smoking a joint will
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Parkinson's, we really want to be
in more control of the dosing and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to fine tune it and know exactly how
much we took and write it in our patient
[SPEAKER_00]: journal so that we can control our doses
better over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when folks are asking you what your
preferred methods are for actually
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting it, what do you like to tell
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually sublingually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sublingual administration involves
holding a tincture or spray under your
[SPEAKER_04]: tongue for a minute to allow some of the
active compounds, in this case
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, to pass through into your
bloodstream more readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in contrast to just swallowing a
tincture, which then needs to pass through
[SPEAKER_04]: your entire digestive system first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually lose a lot of the potency
of the cannabinoids while it's passing
[SPEAKER_04]: through your digestive system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the sublingual administration
allows for a faster onset and maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more better absorption of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have also, and this is a bit
controversial, but especially with people
[SPEAKER_04]: who are very concerned about cannabis use,
I have suggested maybe starting or trying
[SPEAKER_04]: a transdermal patch first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transdermal patches have a lot of issues
in terms of consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: People's skin are different thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult to tell really how
bioavailable the compounds are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the benefit is you could put it on and
feel the effects really quickly within 15
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you don't like the effects,
you can take it off and then the effects
[SPEAKER_04]: will go away just as quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's sort of a good way to see if
this is something that works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are very expensive, so not like the
best maybe long-term solution,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is where you can start to move into
the land of sublingual administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still looking for a transdermal
patch that I really like what's in it too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because transdermal preparation,
that is a lot of heavy processing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get to that point, we're often way
beyond whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're into some kind of over-processed
version, which at that point, if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's gonna go transdermal,
I actually like taking cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it with a little bit of hand lotion
and actually using it as a topical and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting it soak through the skin rather
than going transdermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that the transdermal
technology has come into its own yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think that as more investment
money comes into the cannabis world and we
[SPEAKER_00]: get more crossover for the scientists that
are really good at making them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to see more of them come to
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows, that transdermal may
actually already exist in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical states, and I just haven't come
across that product yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, the transdermal technology
has advanced a lot in the past several
[SPEAKER_04]: years and really outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very interesting administration
method for very small molecules like
[SPEAKER_04]: nicotine or estrogen for nicotine patches
or birth control patches, which is where
[SPEAKER_04]: this sort of technology really evolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have seen promising suggestions
for the transdermal technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we still have a lot to learn
as far as that administration method.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tinctures just really are very easy as
far as dosage control, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, Parkinson's is one of the
diseases where maybe because of the length
[SPEAKER_04]: of time that cannabis has been used to
treat Parkinson's, there have been some
[SPEAKER_04]: studies that have shown benefits from
smoked cannabis, especially as far as mood
[SPEAKER_04]: and fatigue and pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if those are the symptoms that
you're really looking to help mitigate in
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's disease, smoking could be a
really good option for you if you're open
[SPEAKER_04]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's a really good point to
make too, because when I was dissuading
[SPEAKER_00]: from the smoking aspect, I was thinking to
get the cannabinoids unchanged into the
[SPEAKER_00]: body where it can cause neurogenesis of
these dopamine-creating neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for specifically that, sure,
a sublingual tincture or oil is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms that come with Parkinson's
can very well be treated with a joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the quality of life aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of Parkinson's patients that
they have found that their favorite part
[SPEAKER_00]: of their day is sitting on their porch and
smoking a joint and just feeling not
[SPEAKER_00]: crappy for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think another thing to note about
anything that you ingest through your
[SPEAKER_04]: mouth is if you take your cannabinoid
medication with fat, something fatty,
[SPEAKER_04]: a fatty meal, a fatty snack, your body
will absorb those cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly better, like two to three
times better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's always worth noting that if
you are taking a tincture or an edible,
[SPEAKER_04]: eat a spoonful of peanut butter or ice
cream or an avocado or whatever to really
[SPEAKER_04]: help your body absorb those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not an excuse to eat cracky
calories either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking about a very small
amount of fat to the point that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: good capsules are made with a little bit
of oil and a little bit of coconut as the
[SPEAKER_00]: fat in a capsule, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not the reason to take a little
bit of cannabinoids and then a pint of Ben
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jerry's, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're saying here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but if that's how you want your fat,
maybe a couple spoonfuls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, another thing I think we
should hit on before we wrap up our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation is that, you know,
while you and I have both seen huge
[SPEAKER_00]: successes for Parkinson's patients using
cannabis and the vast majority of patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've come across who have used
cannabis have gotten some good results to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that that Parkinson's is kind of
low-hanging fruit for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the more easily accessible and
treatable diseases with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to be clear about that,
that sometimes folks will take cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just won't see the changes that
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, I don't know why,
but it doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have an explanation why it
doesn't work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to know that that is a possibility and
sometimes you also have to play around
[SPEAKER_00]: with the dosage and sometimes it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I suggest that people like after
they've tried for a few weeks and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's just not working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, put the rest of the
cannabis medicine you have aside and like
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a break for a few weeks and then
come back to it and approach it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it works the second time and
sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's just I think it's
important for people to know that if they
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to give this a try, there are
people that they don't get the benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are looking for while there are
people who get incredible benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be gentle with yourself and take notes
in your journal so you are sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, when people say that
cannabis did not help their Parkinson's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost always the fact that they
misunderstood the dosage and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking such a small amount that that it
wouldn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a big and important part of
the jobs that both you and I do at helping
[SPEAKER_04]: patients is modulating expectations and
trying to help people approach cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine as realistically as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, many of the Parkinson's patients
that I've worked with have not had benefit
[SPEAKER_04]: from cannabis therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were OK with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And part of the reason they were OK with
it was, you know, walking into it,
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that it doesn't work for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a bunch of things that you can
try and it's OK if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it might.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where it's like modulate
expectations and keep hope high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and usually the by the time the
people get to cannabis, they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: tried everything else anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, certainly there are
some more nature medicine type folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: will start with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, those are those are our
kind of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that's that's not usually the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, they've gone through all the
pharma first and it either has got really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad side effects or it doesn't work for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, OK, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you hippies got?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and so we we educate them
and hopefully they find some advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even people who don't find that the
cannabis medicine is actually helping
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse or roll back their Parkinson's at
the root core, their quality of lives are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost always increased just because
taking a little bit of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle relaxation aspects of it and
getting your your, you know, getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: munchies, getting your appetite back and
being a little stoned for the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of patients that in and of itself
makes life better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has been in some of the human
studies on Parkinson's disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: both THC and CBT.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have helped people get off of
pharmaceutical painkillers, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: another huge benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it's not helping with Parkinson's
directly, you know, helping you get off of
[SPEAKER_04]: opiates, which might not make you feel
very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I have only taken opiates
once and it made me puke for days,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and it's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that's your only option for pain
relief, having another option is really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like there's all these things
to take into consideration when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: considering whether or not cannabis
medicine is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap this up because,
you know, patients and families and
[SPEAKER_00]: educators who are still with us in this
show, they are probably just lit with
[SPEAKER_00]: interest at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they're probably going to want to
take this and learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so before I ask you for where you would
recommend people to go, I want to start by
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending your video that is on the
Shaping Fire YouTube channel at YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: dot com forward slash shango Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gave a great talk at Vimeo on
Vashon Island about getting to know your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You you expand for about an hour what we
did in about 10 minutes today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only is it is it playful and you
know, you're a humorous person,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also you use, you know, Star Wars
metaphors to explain the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it pretty delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so folks can check that out on on
the Shaping Fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else do you like to send people,
Zoe, to learn more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Project CBD, which is the nonprofit
I worked for for a year and a half before
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommended people go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now after I work there, I recommend
people go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an incredible resource and
will continue to be so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that as far as putting out
information that's accessible to people
[SPEAKER_04]: who are not necessarily scientists,
it's still one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and double down on
on your suggestion of Project CBD dot org,
[SPEAKER_00]: which my listeners are certainly familiar
with, because it is the it's the only web
[SPEAKER_00]: resource that I plug consistently,
because as far as I'm concerned,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is it is the only, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always trustworthy source for information
that's been vetted, plus you can get both
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get articles that translate
cannabis medicine and research into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, regular person vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there's a section on the site
called conditions that you can click on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's like 50 different
conditions there, including Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you click on it, you will get
links to all of the original scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: research on PubMed.gov.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're the kind of person where,
you know, an article is not going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the level of specificity that you need
to make health decisions for you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: family, going to the project CBD dot org
site under conditions and clicking
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's and getting access to the
science firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you'll feel so much more satisfied
with the with the path that you take
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that you have read the science
yourself firsthand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, like if people really want to
get into it, pull up PubMed and search
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And PubMed is a database that correlates
all of the scientific research that's
[SPEAKER_04]: being done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure on everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you open it and search for a
specific specific condition and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's thousands of articles and it could
be a really useful resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Zoe, thank you so much for taking the
time out of your schedule to hang out for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit and to share your vast
experience on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and thank you for sharing your
experience working with patients directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, often there is a gap
between the scientific papers and how
[SPEAKER_00]: patients find relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate you that you have got
both bodies of information and your
[SPEAKER_00]: willingness to share it with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me on Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out more about Zoe and
and keep up with her posts, you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: her on Instagram and that's at Zoe
underscore Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Z-O-E underscore S-I-G-M-A-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you so much for joining us.
