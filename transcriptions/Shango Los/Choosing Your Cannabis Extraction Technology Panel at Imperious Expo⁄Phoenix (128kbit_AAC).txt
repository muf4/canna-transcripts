[SPEAKER_04]: All right, if everybody wants to take a
seat, we are going to get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the two o'clock panel on
choosing your extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your host for the panel, Shango Loos,
and I'm also host of the Shaving Fire
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoy listening to interviews with
the top people in the Canada game,
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to grab a flyer next to
the door on your way out and tune in to my
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast where we listen to conversations
like this each and every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to first introduce our guests
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting directly to my right,
Corey Chavez from Summit Extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: Systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle is Dr. George Stancheff from
Comerg, and on the end, Dr. Sheldon
[SPEAKER_04]: Brodell Jr. from Althena Environmental
Sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to all three of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are merely highlights of each
speaker's bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to Google them or approach
them after the panel to find out more
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: These gentlemen are so smart that I could
go on for paragraphs and then we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have time for your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So starting at the far end, Sheldon
Brodell Jr., PhD, is chief executive and
[SPEAKER_04]: science officer of Althena Environmental
Services.
[SPEAKER_04]: Althena specializes in designing and
building the tools needed to produce and
[SPEAKER_04]: purify biomolecules and then develop the
applications for those biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Althena has a diverse product portfolio of
over 200 products and that are sold around
[SPEAKER_04]: the world for basic science and commercial
uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle is George Stancheff,
is founder and CEO of Comerg, an
[SPEAKER_04]: innovative extraction and purification
systems company.
[SPEAKER_04]: He owns a PhD in electromagnetics,
an MBA in product management, an MS in
[SPEAKER_04]: electrical engineering technology,
and has numerous patents granted and
[SPEAKER_04]: pending.
[SPEAKER_04]: And directly to my right is Cory Chavez.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is CEO and co-founder of Summit
Extraction Systems of Loughlin,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado, a manufacturer of closed-loop
butane extraction systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cory is also founder of Sensible Durango,
a marijuana reform organization that
[SPEAKER_04]: coordinated with national activists to
advocate for marijuana decriminalization
[SPEAKER_04]: and regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that the format is going to go for
this panel is I've got a series of
[SPEAKER_04]: questions that I'm going to ask the
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start at one end and then we'll
start at the other end and hopefully get a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of conversation going and we'll
save about 10 or 15 minutes at the end for
[SPEAKER_04]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start with a question on
the far end for Sheldon there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sheldon, I've worked with clients who
have chosen their products for market
[SPEAKER_04]: first and then they choose their
extraction technology to suit the products
[SPEAKER_04]: that they've got in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've also worked with clients who
first choose their preferred extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: method and then they design the products
on what those technologies can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do you suggest that a new
cannabis company looking to extract starts
[SPEAKER_04]: their decision-making process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I teach tech entrepreneurship
at the university, the first thing I say
[SPEAKER_03]: is ask your customer what do they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would argue that you want to start
with the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the customer need?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the customer trying to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_03]: What problem are you solving for the
customer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Build your formulations based on that
information and then decide what the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction or downstream purification
process would be to meet those
[SPEAKER_03]: specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: George, what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I would answer as well
because really your customer gives you the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and the other way around I would
call that innovation because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to invade the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pretty much if you want to get the
other market tomorrow, you need to listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the customer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so knowing the enterprise you'd like
to create is a big component of your
[SPEAKER_05]: choosing your extraction technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain extraction methods are well suited
to particular end products and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: some extraction methods that are more
versatile than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So knowing the end products you'd like to
create, whether that's a high-end
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrate, shatter or wax, a distillate
vaporizer, or an infused edible product,
[SPEAKER_05]: or a topical cream, those are kind of the
major categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vaporizer pans, concentrates, edibles,
and topical products.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's one of those categories in
particular that's appealing to your
[SPEAKER_05]: company, then we can work backwards from
that to determine which extraction method
[SPEAKER_05]: is best suited.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some extraction methods that are
generalists.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're well suited for all end products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's other technologies that
you can add to your initial extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: system to further purify the product for
particular end products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you dive into that a little bit more
as we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But knowing your end product is,
of course, very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the product you're going to bring
to market?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't know, then maybe a
product with more an extraction method,
[SPEAKER_05]: more versatility, is best suited to your
end products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one's for you, Jordan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a wide range of opinion
regarding the use of hydrocarbons like
[SPEAKER_04]: butane and propane for extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give great taste and good returns by
percent, but so few know how to remove the
[SPEAKER_04]: residual solvents in the industry,
leading to failed lab tests and sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: a dangerous product to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: To what degree do you think that these
technologies will continue to be top tier
[SPEAKER_04]: options for commercial cannabis
extractors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, that refers a little bit to
the previous question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly we need to extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different solvents and there are
different constituents in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each solvent extracts a set of
constituents in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are oil-soluble constituents in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are alcohol-soluble and
water-soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use water, extract one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use alcohol, another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you use oils, you extract oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually similar, extract similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important feature of a solvent
to get separated very easily because the
[SPEAKER_01]: simplest solvent is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make a tea, that's an extract,
but then you're removing the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very expensive process because
then you have to heat it and it's a long
[SPEAKER_01]: process to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CO2 is a process that you can remove
the solvent very easily, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: solubility of CO2, it's very tricky to set
the point to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can dissolve with CO2 and
water-soluble and alcohol-soluble and
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol-soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to set up the impact point of
the certain temperature and pressure in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to separate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you take more that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, coming back to the question what
exactly you need to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to extract oils, there are
non-polar solvents that can help you use
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to extract supplements like
alkaloids, then use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there are general solvent
technologies like putanes and alcohols and
[SPEAKER_01]: hexane and CO2 that can be always used
because they are very well-known and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can make raw materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use those raw materials for
concentrates or isolates and anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first step, you can do a general
solvent or we use solvent reproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: that gives you a single-step process to
extract exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of sort of parallel things to
consider when you're choosing what solvent
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solvent recovery is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how expensive is it going to be to
recover that solvent?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much energy you're going to be putting
into the system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the more difficult the solvent
recovery is, the higher the cost for the
[SPEAKER_03]: economics on your process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another aspect is that in this particular
industry, everyone is being very,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a sustainable environment, which is
really cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of fun coming out of the
pharmaceutical industry to watch how this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry is evolving with a very strong
eco-friendly, environmentally responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you think in those terms,
think about how is the solvent going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: recovered?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's not recovered, because some of
it does leak out, what damage is it going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do to my employees, to myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what damage could it possibly do to
the environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I minimize that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other aspect, too,
is then the economics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some solvents are more economical to work
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's sort of this multifaceted,
and I hate to use this term, too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's coming down the pipe,
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got OSHA regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's regulations to start with,
but sorry folks, the FDA is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: coming soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to require certain
controls in place that you can guarantee
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've removed that solvent from the
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think long-term, thinking in terms of
all these aspects, environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibility, economics, and what
regulatory issues am I going to be dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with down the road a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts for me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think more of the nuance of your
question was what concerns over residual
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent or residual contaminants and
hydrocarbon solvents?
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're talking about products for
customers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are really concerned about PHO
and VHO and the poor skills of a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: lab folk in removing the residual solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you're on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I think that was much more of a
concern several years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the great trends that our industry
is creating is higher quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: better purity solvents are becoming more
readily available.
[SPEAKER_05]: For hydrocarbons and mutant and propane,
that means 99.99, hopefully more nines,
[SPEAKER_05]: or as close to 100% as possible,
percent purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So solvent distributors, gas distributors,
are getting better at providing
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrate manufacturers with higher
purity solvent, grade, medical grade,
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical grade solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a good trend that's minimizing
that concern, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If the solvent doesn't contain a lot of
contaminants, it's close to its pure
[SPEAKER_05]: chemical form.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's close to just butane or just propane,
the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, filtration methods within closed
loop systems are improving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Filter media and process improvements,
such as doing a butane or propane
[SPEAKER_05]: distillation prior to introducing the
solvent into actual cannabis extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just distilling the solvent itself
prior to doing extraction runs,
[SPEAKER_05]: that removes a lot of traditional
contaminants, such as heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_05]: lubricants that may have ended up in the
solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a number of ways filtration
media distillations prior to extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: runs that minimize residual solvent
contaminants in the end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, there's a number of great
technologies after step one, producing raw
[SPEAKER_05]: crude oil through VHO extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use white film systems that can
totally remove residual solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the process, also fractionate and
separate the CBD compounds, THC compounds,
[SPEAKER_05]: separate the residual solvent sphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're isolating the compounds,
and in the process, also removing the
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a number of techniques and
trends and processes in the industry that
[SPEAKER_05]: are improving the quality and purity of
VHO and VHO extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we go on, I'm questioning
whether or not Corey's mic is picking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you in the back able to hear,
Corey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe a little louder.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'll show the mic for next
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the next question, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back to starting with George,
please, if you would.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's kind of a lot to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that a lot of people are
probably expecting us to be talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: present existing high tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as entrepreneurs in the market
and what people are asking for,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's talk about rosin press.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pressing flowers with a little bit of
heat has come a long way from using the
[SPEAKER_04]: hair straightener to the new scaled up
presses that output a flood of grams at
[SPEAKER_04]: one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, they don't really feel ready for
large scale commercial use here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, the returns look pretty good
and often on par with VHO, and the purity
[SPEAKER_04]: was out of question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't use any solvent at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many believe that mechanical pressing is
the future, but the technology has not
[SPEAKER_04]: been upscaled yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are your thoughts on the current
state of rosin style extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: technology, and where do you see it
heading?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, this is a question to the end
product user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need a concentrate or just oil from
the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you press it, you get an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually in a plant, the oil is about 30%
in the best to 50% in the slowest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you use a system like with
liquefied gas, then you're really putting
[SPEAKER_01]: a concentrate where the oil is 85%
concentrated, 60% to 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pull the concentrate,
you also use certain selectivity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent to be able to use that oil within
eatable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come with certain dilutions to be
sure how many milligrams of this
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents you have to put for about
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple organic method to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually works mostly on flowers,
because if you have to process trim,
[SPEAKER_01]: that method is not going to be efficient
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually, if you want to process flowers
with rosin, then trim with concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: with liquefied gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you great?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think rosin press and other mechanical
methods of extraction are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you indicated, they're difficult to
reproduce at scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really the key point in choosing
your technology is what is your processing
[SPEAKER_05]: volume?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your throughput?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much raw material do you need to
process?
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's small amounts, using a rosin press
or another mechanical means of extraction,
[SPEAKER_05]: such as an ice water bath, a bubble hash,
bubble bags, or a bubble hash washing
[SPEAKER_05]: machine, those are much simpler and much
less expensive methods of extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: compared with solvent-based extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But solvent-based extraction is going to
win in terms of efficiency and processing
[SPEAKER_05]: throughput every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think rosin presses are really good
for connoisseur concentrate markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: They typically get a shatter produced
through a rosin press.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's typically a premium product in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very well known in just the
general market.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I consider it more of a
connoisseur product that people are kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of in the know, know about different
extraction methods, are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: in tune with the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd request that or a bubble hash
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's not
efficient method of production for edible
[SPEAKER_05]: oils or any other form of concentrate at
scale in a production set.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say the one advantage that a press
type or mechanical extraction system will
[SPEAKER_03]: have is it's not going to infuse the
material with what we call an advantageous
[SPEAKER_03]: agent, a solvent that is not normally
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some markets, it's going to have a
benefit because you're not going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: exposed it to these extra agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, you get a very
different product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, again, as this gentleman said,
that oftentimes it goes back to who's your
[SPEAKER_03]: customer and what kind of product do they
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to serve a place in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if somebody can figure out how to
scale it, it's going to be very
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that scaling issue,
and that's probably just around the corner
[SPEAKER_03]: because, of course, they use similar types
of technologies with other seed oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's done on a very, very large
scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this particular case, I think it's
only a matter of time before some engineer
[SPEAKER_03]: figures it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there does seem to be a lot of people
thinking about that technology now
[SPEAKER_04]: because, like Corey mentioned,
it is a connoisseur product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the temperatures have gotten so low at
this point that it does a pretty decent
[SPEAKER_04]: job with terms and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, unfortunately, it's probably
just for connoisseur dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not it at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, it may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also, I think, you have to be
mindful.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do with the dabbing
strength?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the processing steps you're
going to go through?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the raws impression, there's two
factors in the extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the selectability, using the
solvent to select things, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that raws impression is probably
the least efficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has really no selectability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big drawback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you're just trying to extract
everything from the plant, it's OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not as efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this goes back to the original
round of questions when we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about what you're producing and for what
kind of a customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're looking to produce a
product that is whole plant, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: since we're having this discussion in a
state that's medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're thinking a lot about whole plant
healing versus a technology that's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to pull out similar cannabinoids to be
used as isolates or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, rosin is not going to be an
appropriate technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all three of you gentlemen have
expertise on a wide range of extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also expect that you each probably
have at least one solution that you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: to be either the best or at least the one
that you most recommend to cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: entrepreneurs who are moving into
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my question is, what are you
recommending to people right now who are
[SPEAKER_04]: going into business as your preferred
solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you want to start showing?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so our group works on the downstream
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually don't have a preferred
method.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people that don't know what downstream
side means, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the downstream side, so the way we view
the materials that you're working with,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a crude oil extract has hundreds
of compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we refer to extraction as an
upstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even upstream from that is the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under certain conditions, the plant makes
a certain combination of the different
[SPEAKER_03]: phytochemicals that have their various
activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step is to extract those
chemicals out into what's called a crude
[SPEAKER_03]: material, which is what most folks are
working with right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our idea is that you go one step
further now and you start separating all
[SPEAKER_03]: of those components of the plant into
their individual chemical constituents and
[SPEAKER_03]: then reconstitute things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that after the extract is what we
refer to as the downstream purification.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of us that work more on the
downstream side where we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: separate everything, we've developed
systems that are really agnostic with
[SPEAKER_03]: regard to how you extract it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our systems can handle any type of
material coming off the extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so intentionally, we're not worried
too much about whether it's using CO2 or
[SPEAKER_03]: freon or butane or any of the other types
of solvents because our system is designed
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to separate all that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your starting point is not the flour or
trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your starting point is the oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where you're focusing about
what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That point forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our company designs different
extraction systems, hexane, butane,
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, and water, steam water systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're here talking about a solvent
called freon that is the most efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent to extract oils, CBD, THC,
and turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And selectivity of freon is best for this
plant because based on that selectivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: we measure over 95% efficiency of
extraction, which is very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need any post-processing after
you have the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about the full plant
extract, if we're not interested in full
[SPEAKER_01]: plant extract and we want to concentrate
or isolate, we run this extract through a
[SPEAKER_01]: system like HPLC, and we get 99.9% HPLC,
BKTHC, and we separate the turps in
[SPEAKER_01]: another bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our case, using freon, it's
advantageous because first, we've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 30 degree C.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that at room temperature,
it's well in gaseous space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no residual in the plant to educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can compare to alcohol,
60 degrees of water point, compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: butane, it's about zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only CO2 is kind of competitive to
that because it's a gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the same side, freon is not horrible,
not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: By also data, 57%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentration in the environment,
it's safe for over four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: While 8% of CO2 in the environment can
make your brain dead in four minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 6% are muted in the environment
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have certain precautions
when you work with some other extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better go out with us, it's like dealing
with a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the safest and fastest
methods to do extraction, specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and THC oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was reading about this technology in
preparation for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the return numbers were pretty
astonishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long has this technology been around?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I actually got on the phone and
called up some of my attraction friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, have you heard about this purified
technology, and it's using freon?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all like, freon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've read some of the interviews that
you've done on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long has this technology existed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Purified is our trade name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Purified is known in the last year
since we entered the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, for 12 years,
we were doing aromatics and fragrance and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraction of rose and lavender oils of
over 150 different fruit-grade
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been known for a long, long time into
the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's approved by FDA since 2001,
and in Europe since 1999.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been proven in other industries,
but it's a rival.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is the part that's more new,
not necessarily the technology itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because cannabis is a new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, new industries start with
general solvents, whatever is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when we talk about production,
about large scale, about volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly see a lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the machines available commercially
yet for cannabis, or are you still in
[SPEAKER_04]: startup mode that you're still learning
how to produce them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or for specifically cannabis clients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they're available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our small machine extracts about 20 pounds
a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our large machine extracts about 60
pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have large scale extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to spend a little more time on
this, because it's a technology that I had
[SPEAKER_04]: not heard of, and I'm not sure if all of
you had either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So same question to you, Corey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are you recommending to people
now, and why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in full disclosure, some extraction
systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I work is a manufacturer of close
loop butane extraction systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason we decided to build our
business around using butane and other
[SPEAKER_05]: light hydrocarbons, such as propane,
is simply for efficiency and versatility.
[SPEAKER_05]: The end products that you can grade with
light hydrocarbon extract span the full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: From bulk edible oils, highly purified
oils for vaporizer cartridges,
[SPEAKER_05]: oils for topical creams, and then unique
to butane, raw concentrates such as
[SPEAKER_05]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult to reverse engineer
concentrates like that using other
[SPEAKER_05]: methods.
[SPEAKER_05]: So butane offers great versatility in
terms of the end products you can create.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our equipment, we focus on producing bulk
cannabis oils that can be further refined
[SPEAKER_05]: to whichever particular type of end
product our customers are making.
[SPEAKER_05]: So versatility is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we operate at relatively low
pressures, especially compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: supercritical CO2, the raw material cost
of the components of the extractor are
[SPEAKER_05]: much lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So upfront equipment cost is very
attractive for butane extraction systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then cycle time is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long it takes to produce your oils,
and I've been giving out the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with butane extractions, CO2 or other
methods are very fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a number of advantages in
butane as an end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solvent from cannabis is well established
in our industry, and concentrates are
[SPEAKER_05]: produced via butane extracts, especially
because of its ability to preserve turbine
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles and flavor and aromatics of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: For that reason, butane extracts have won
more high times cannabis cup awards,
[SPEAKER_04]: and more concentrate awards than any other
solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the rub, isn't it, Ray?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because butane dab oil keeps the turps on
point, and it tastes fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you really need to know who your
processor is, and that they're getting rid
[SPEAKER_04]: of the residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing how many cups you'll go to,
and you see the oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got great color, and the judges will
taste it or not, depending on what order
[SPEAKER_04]: they do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the testing comes back,
and they've all blown their numbers on
[SPEAKER_04]: residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that the extractor believed
that it was great, because they spent the
[SPEAKER_04]: $1,000 to enter, and then all of the
samples as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But while they had the extraction done,
they didn't know how to clean it up
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll say that in regulated
environments where our solvent-based
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction is regulated, the residual
solvent amount usually indicates in terms
[SPEAKER_05]: of ppm parts per million is established
and regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you're able to take a
solvent-based extract to the market,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to have a batch of that tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the actual amount of parts per million
varies state to state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that will become more standardized
over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in regulated markets, you can't
release anything like extracts or edibles
[SPEAKER_05]: or any solvent, any oils that were derived
from solvent-based extraction into the
[SPEAKER_05]: market that don't meet those
safe-to-consume thresholds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cups, they're a little more lax in
terms of who can enter, who can submit
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might find some higher residual
solvents in those type of settings than an
[SPEAKER_05]: actual medical dispenser, medical
marijuana or recreational dispenser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this next question is going to go in a
totally different direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But considering we're speaking to cannabis
entrepreneurs who are looking to buy
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction equipment and set up labs,
you've all worked in extraction labs to
[SPEAKER_04]: some degree or another and had assistants
helping you along the way most lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those in the room who'd be taking
your advice to the bank when they use it
[SPEAKER_04]: to build their extraction companies,
what attributes should they look for in
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction lab staff?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of variety of the kinds of
people that can be hired for the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you recommend to be some
attributes that these business owners look
[SPEAKER_04]: for in lab extraction staff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll start Bob with you, Sheldon.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So staffing, you definitely want to bring
in, if you're not expert yourself in the
[SPEAKER_03]: chemistry behind these systems,
I would definitely look for experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: chemists or biochemists who has done these
types of extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not necessarily on cannabis,
but certainly maybe in the flavor and
[SPEAKER_03]: fragrance markets where a lot of these
folks will have expertise in doing
[SPEAKER_03]: extractions, handling the equipment,
doing the chemistry that's required and
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding how the process can vary and
those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely someone with a technical
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lead person should have at least,
I would say, five years or more of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience with BY recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the staff supports that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be anywhere from someone with an
associate's degree on up, but trainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have to learn the
chemistry and the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these systems do run under pressure of
some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit of, I don't know,
I don't like pressurized systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you want to make sure that they
understand the rules behind the chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: and the biochemistry of operating systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is certainly one thing that we
design our systems around so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need any expertise to run a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, you need to load it,
push a button, and collect extract within
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the best person to operate our
machine is the refrigeration condition
[SPEAKER_01]: because he knows what's going on inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the selectivity of Freon is so
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have so much consistency every
time that you don't need to even think
[SPEAKER_01]: about that temperature, what happened with
the solvent, because everything happened
[SPEAKER_01]: at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't damage the plant by any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing really that you can do
to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it sound very plug and play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you run 10 machines and still have
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll agree with Dr. Henshiff that I don't
think there's a high educational
[SPEAKER_05]: requirement for a lot of the latest
systems that are coming on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The simplicity in which to operate the
equipment is improving.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of systems are adding semi-automated
or automated capabilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think unless you're producing a
very highly formulated, very refined
[SPEAKER_05]: product that you need to have,
go as far as to have a chemist or a
[SPEAKER_05]: biochemist on staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of consultants that can help
you kind of establish your SOPs,
[SPEAKER_05]: your standard operating procedures,
to produce the perfect extract for your
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't necessarily have to increase
your payroll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having agreed, production workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in wealth, we have a little controversy
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an investor, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see an experienced person on
staff before I put money into your
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another side.
[SPEAKER_03]: These gentlemen are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their instruments are plug and play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours are very easy to use as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of these instruments,
by design, are intended to be easy to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you can get away with using an
inexperienced person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would feel more comfortable with an
experienced person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have to be mindful of how your
investors are going to view it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's another dynamic that comes
into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to try to raise a half
million dollars and to operate some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these instruments, your investors are
going to want to see that either you have
[SPEAKER_03]: the expertise or somebody on staff does.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, that's my perspective as an
investor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would want that.
[SPEAKER_04]: An extraction consultant that I work with
regularly, he says, your trained staff is
[SPEAKER_04]: not necessarily there for the everyday,
because you can just grab an active
[SPEAKER_04]: learner, and they'll be able to run your
lab on an everyday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on your worst day that you need to
have somebody who's trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there's a lot of insight
in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When things go badly wrong, and they will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the biotech industry long
enough to know that things override very
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have an expert around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got time enough just for a couple
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, when you have an
inspector come into your facility,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've called London talking to somebody
knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight years ago when I sold the
first butane extractor to the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys that were doing the extractions
didn't have a lot of experience in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have a lot of education in
what they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full spectrum extractions were kind of
what they were going at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe oil extractions, but they didn't
know how to select.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're in a highly selective industry
where they're trying to select and target
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need an extractor that can be more
selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that we're going to go is the
way that he's going, where we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start extracting everything from
the plant, letting these post-operation
[SPEAKER_00]: processes take form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that he's going to fall right
into place where we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go upscale large production,
you're not going to be trying to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take everything at once, and then after
the fact figure out what you want to slice
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now you need one that can do
everything, and then later you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like to break it into stage one
extraction, just pulling out your bulk
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really what a lot of close-loop
extraction systems do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need a co-solvent to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to add other solvents
to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even ethanol and CO2, as broad as they
are, they're not highly selective at one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of stage one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stage two is when you get into
chromatography or fractional distillation,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're really further separating those
compounds if you have a product that
[SPEAKER_05]: requires that sort of separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have one more out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: In spring on, are you mixing other
co-solvents with the freon and having good
[SPEAKER_00]: results?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try different co-solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger issue when we do all the
co-solvents together is the boiling point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to separate them, knowing that
minus 30, we try different freons over 10
[SPEAKER_01]: different freons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are mixtures, but they all
have different boiling points.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it comes to the same point,
when you maintain a refrigerator,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to refill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot, you have to drain everything
and do it brand new, then refill again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with co-solvents happens in the
extraction system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to maintain same quality of the
extraction output.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to maintain that proportion
between the co-solvents the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have, by the way, exactly what you
said, co-solvent ethanol, but we use it
[SPEAKER_01]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we work for 20 minutes freon,
and then we run the ethanol, so we get all
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble and all the more supplement side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're moving, you have to do this
isolation process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a volume of solvent,
you can pass two at one pass, you can mix
[SPEAKER_00]: them together uniformly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we wrap up, I just want to plug
the next panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be starting here at three o'clock,
which is going to be on working together
[SPEAKER_04]: and marketing co-branding to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I encourage you to be here for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's thank our panelists for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Sheldon Brodell, Dr. Mark Sanchez,
and Corey Sharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
