[SPEAKER_00]: I have been interested in the days right
before death my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a child, my aunt started one of
the first hospices in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up mowing the lawn of the small
house that acted as its office.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom worked there for almost 20 years in
grant writing and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad worked there too in public
outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hospice, death and dying was a constant
topic at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't dark or sad in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the service my family
provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: In high school, I was on the debate team
and we had an entire debate season on the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of euthanasia and living wills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though debate is a game, I learned
the intricacies of what legally defines
[SPEAKER_00]: life and how the state and families play a
role beside the wishes of the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as an adult talking and teaching
about cannabis medicine, people come up to
[SPEAKER_00]: me right at the grocery store or they got
me and they asked to talk to them in their
[SPEAKER_00]: car or they stopped me after public
speeches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often they let me know they are
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to learn about cannabis
relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned to give an efficient,
dry and to the point response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks seem to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off they go to find some cannabis
tincture with an understanding of dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is important because dying is
not cool and there will be no marketing or
[SPEAKER_00]: information provided to cannabis folks who
are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who will die soon and their
families need one place to get most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information they may need to get started
down this path all in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I'm trying to do with this
episode today.

[SPEAKER_00]: Sunil has previously been a guest on
Shaping Fire Episode 3 explaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical history of humans and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be discussing
integrating cannabis medicine into end of
[SPEAKER_00]: life care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Sunil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's so great to be back, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get let's get right into it
and make clear what we're actually talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about today because you know, a lot of us
have heard, you know, our friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: family and even the news talk about end of
life care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But except for the idea that, oh,
that person's probably reaching the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have a real grasp on what
that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when caregivers use the term end of
life care, what exactly are they saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, end of life care is in this in this
country usually happens in in hospice
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_01]: If most most people, you know,
when they are facing end of life means in
[SPEAKER_01]: hospice, your prognosis is you have a
medical condition which two doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: certify that you might have six months or
less to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a it's a it's a it's kind of a
care when you have you know that somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: is near the end of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how how do you manage the care such
that you maximize the quality of life with
[SPEAKER_01]: the time you have left?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that involves a whole range of
of skill sets from the care from the
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver standpoint, from the medical
system standpoint, from the family
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's and that's sort of
all falls under the umbrella of end of
[SPEAKER_01]: life care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how far away from death does a patient
have to be to to, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify for end of life care hospice
treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, in a certain way,
we're all terminal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's got to be a window
where it's it's it's so close that that
[SPEAKER_00]: the strategy changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's why I mentioned hospice at
the at the get go, because this this
[SPEAKER_01]: really is how we build our system of care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hospice is sort of the most intensive,
like palliative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another term I want to let your
listeners know about is palliative care,
[SPEAKER_01]: which grew out of hospice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the type of care palliative means
to cover or to cloak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a medical specialty,
you know, where you're working on symptom
[SPEAKER_01]: management, really high quality symptom
management, supportive care, looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: physical, emotional, psychological,
spiritual suffering, we call that total
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that type of care happens most
intensely, 100 percent in hospice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like palliative intensive care in
hospice, where and that usually happens at
[SPEAKER_01]: a patient's home and the team comes to
them and also is available by by phone or
[SPEAKER_01]: telemedicine in these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's kind of and that that
really is a benefit that anybody is
[SPEAKER_01]: eligible for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if two doctors say that they
are potentially six months or less to
[SPEAKER_01]: live, no matter what, what medical
condition that might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, but people know that even,
you know, patients need need some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: palliative care much earlier than than in
being a hospice care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, anybody, you know,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could all benefit from greater
quality of life and better symptom
[SPEAKER_01]: management and care for the total pain
that we experience in our lives,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a very holistic model of care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely, that's that's somebody
something that anybody can benefit no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter what for their age or illness
status.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the medical field of palliative care
has decided to focus its efforts on
[SPEAKER_01]: patients with anyone who has a what we
call a serious or life threatening
[SPEAKER_01]: illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's at any stage of that
illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be, you know, years before
somebody might, you know, reach and reach
[SPEAKER_01]: their death.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is that patients can still be
eligible for that kind of care,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though they're not in hospice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it just happens in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting the that that definition
that you gave us for palliative care where
[SPEAKER_00]: it is care that is more holistic and
taking care of the whole human instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just let's say the the chemistry and
mechanics of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you describe that, I thought to
myself, well, hell, that's that's the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of care that I wish I was getting from my
doctor my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not how we how we do tend to
do things in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: which which is interesting because,
you know, our general fear of death in
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit on palliative care and you hit on
end of life care as far as definitions go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since so many people use the term
terminal care, why don't you hit on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And your answer may be it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but specifically, what do people
mean about terminal care for folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're trying to decipher
what their doctor is telling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, terminal, if your terminal,
if you get a diagnosis, the doctor says
[SPEAKER_01]: you are terminally ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just means that you have a diagnosis
of an illness that based on statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: tables, you know, will will lead to your
death and that there's a lot of ranges of
[SPEAKER_01]: variable variability in terms of,
you know, two years one year, six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there's like a lot of variation in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, for example, an illness like ALS
or Lou Gehrig's disease, people may live
[SPEAKER_01]: with that for many years and the decline
might be slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where, you know, the patient might
slowly lose muscle function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't we don't have a cure for that
right now, although there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: experimental approaches out there that
might modify the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, so there's another kind of
philosophy or school of thought where
[SPEAKER_01]: people say, well, we say the word terminal
too quickly in medicine and that really
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a it's it's it can be a sort
of what do you call it like arrogance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are there are definite
examples of spontaneous remissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, you know, there are
experimental approaches and other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: things out there that, you know,
there are people with stage four cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, who are living for many,
many years now with certain types of
[SPEAKER_01]: advancements that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody gets a diagnosis of stage
four cancer, you know, and they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, that's that's terminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not pursue those other types of
therapies that, you know, have are showing
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness for survival longevity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm a little I'm cautious
with the term terminal because of the like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it implies a lot more than we
really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is helpful to know the statistical
tables, you know, and doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that they all apply to the
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of individual variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've we've kind of I think we still
use it in hospice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in hospice care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do certify that somebody is,
you know, we think we'll have six months
[SPEAKER_01]: or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what happens, people still get,
let's say they're living longer because
[SPEAKER_01]: now they're having better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then the doctors have to recertify
the patient periodically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, they live longer than we thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do we still think they're
terminal and then they have to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: a process like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it's kind of a it's a moving
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for the clarity of folks,
when we talk about terminal or not
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal, but let's use end of life care
in this case, we're not really looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because very often on this show,
we talk about, you know, taking large
[SPEAKER_00]: doses of cannabinoids to to fight cancer
or, you know, other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally terminal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but really, by the time you're in end
of life care, the goal really isn't to OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the ways that we can we can stop
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about how can we make you
comfortable?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make you mentally present so
that you can interact with your family?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we decrease your pain so you can
experience some joy and maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of self-actualization before your last
breaths?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not really about curing you
anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, people still people can
still have hope for that kind of thing if
[SPEAKER_01]: they we don't we don't want to discourage
that you can still have that kind of care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can have the care exactly as
you described impeccable management of
[SPEAKER_01]: comfort, family support, psychospheres,
physical physical health and healing in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of quality of life, you know,
improving your, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: your mental acuity or just physical
comfort, all the different layers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then making sure that your family is
also cared for and has support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we usually accomplish this with not
just like one doctor or one nurse,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really like a whole team of we call a
multidisciplinary team of specialists like
[SPEAKER_01]: chaplains, social workers, you know,
integrative therapy, acupuncture providers
[SPEAKER_01]: or Reiki or enter, you know, there's a
very broad range of specialties that get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved to to make that that kind of care
possible at the end of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, a patient might say,
well, you know, I'm, I still want to take
[SPEAKER_01]: my ex, you know, because even though that
that might might be like an experimental
[SPEAKER_01]: therapy, you know, to help a patient to
see if that'll improve their the length of
[SPEAKER_01]: time that they have or slow the disease,
that's that's not a incompatible with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And patients still have a right to explore
experimental treatments, even while
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on hospice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just generally the hospice,
the medical Medicare, which is usually
[SPEAKER_01]: most patients in hospice or Medicare,
they don't pay for that care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do let you see a doctor on the
outside one doctor on the outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: like your old primary doctor or somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so there is a way to still have hospice
care, high quality end of life care and
[SPEAKER_01]: still explore the other aspects that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, I'm that we we don't the
end of life care folks are focused on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that quality of life as good as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so that no matter what the patient is
doing, you know, that's that's the best
[SPEAKER_01]: possible day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then also, the people who live on
after the patient that they're not racked
[SPEAKER_01]: with complicated grief or trauma from the
from from their loved ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so just for the sake of clarification,
because the particular audience that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, you said that the patient
may still want to be taking their X and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a, you know, maybe an, you know,
not totally researched or finished
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say X, you meant like a variable
like whatever pharmaceutical that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting good relief on, you are not
referring to ecstasy MDMA, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another show, you wouldn't have to
clarify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on this show, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was we work with a whole lot of
different entheogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although I mean, certainly,
we can talk about entheogens and
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical entheogens like MDMA here,
or the congeners, MDMA is like similar to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something from sassafras or
sephirol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that these are, you know, and and also
has similar similar to mescaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been mescaline has been used for,
you know, 1000 years, at least more in in
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of healing, like holistic
healing that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely like that we can
talk about that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was referring to in that context,
like if anybody wants to sort of use I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had a lot of patients in hospice that
continue to use different like supplements
[SPEAKER_01]: or natural medicines that are,
you know, they hope that have anti cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, for example, but at the same
time, they're receiving high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: hospice care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's still possible to have that
hope of having something to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do something about the disease process,
but also being under the care of a team
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really focusing on your comfort and
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so while we're probably not going to
have time to get into the the MDMA mimic
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just suggested, which is like,
mescaline and from a root, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of people whose ears just
perked up like mine did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give us a quick search term
for folks who want to look that up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what would they Google to find out
more about this preparation you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sassafras root.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's sassafra.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was that was just I was just giving
an example of like, you know, it's a MDMA
[SPEAKER_01]: was made in a German by a German chemist
in the 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But its chemical structure is very similar
to a chemical that's been used in natural
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sassafras oil, an ingredient in sassafras
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I was just sort of tying it
back to back to a natural cogener or
[SPEAKER_01]: something in nature that it's very similar
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was also tying it to the class
of of compounds called phenylethal amines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenylethal amines are are what MDMA is
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are naturally occurring
phenylethal amine mescaline, as your
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners might have heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just giving you some you threw
MDMA over there and talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: entheogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to one of my interests is this
class of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're they have a huge role
to play in an end of life care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting lots of research studies
on that nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's even more compelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, I'm incorporating some of that
in my practice, but we can talk about that
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because cannabis is such a versatile
healing herb, you know, it's it's used for
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide range of relief in all sorts of
ways capsules and vaped and tinctures and
[SPEAKER_00]: suppositories and smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, as as a doctor, you know,
who still has a very active clinical life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are seeing patients and families
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that even though there's a wide
range of possible uses for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that there are some that come up more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these uses that come up more
often that you see when actually dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with real life patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cannabis is a widely widely utilized
for managing the pain and managing
[SPEAKER_01]: fatigue, managing insomnia, managing,
like nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the did I mention mood?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think that that there's like,
a whole symptom cluster that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can help patients with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's exactly what I have
seen in my practice and encourage patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that have access to cannabis, who are at,
you know, an end of life care settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not always easy to make that
access thing happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going to talk about that
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you do have access to cannabis,
it can do a lot of work to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: these really difficult symptoms that
normally doctors would prescribe opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: and benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some pharmaceutical anti nausea
medicines to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really interesting, isn't it how
some of the some of the symptoms that
[SPEAKER_00]: patients want relief for are are some of
the more basic things that cannabis helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with like nausea and pain and just general
muscle tension, stress, anxiety about
[SPEAKER_00]: being sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and yet, you know, once folks start
taking it for that, they start to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other benefits, like,
oh, gosh, my, my, my IBS has gone away,
[SPEAKER_00]: or my headaches have gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and then suddenly,
now they're now they're taking it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: much wider range of symptoms than they
originally taking it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once they have first person
experience with it, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, where's this been all my life?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called I call those side benefits,
as opposed to side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we're going to go to the we're
going to go to a break soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to during the second
set, we're going to talk much more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically about using cannabis for end
of life care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I want to before we go,
I want to make sure that we, we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how this process gets started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when cannabis comes up,
do you find that it's normally you as the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor who is mentioning it to the patient
and their family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you find that usually, it's the
patient who has found out about it on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own and they are requesting this
guidance from you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shango, I would say that the answer
to that question has shifted quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: over the last, you know, 10, I guess I've
been, I've been interacting with patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as a professional medical
student or something for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the situation from the first half of my
career practice has shifted where to
[SPEAKER_01]: initially where I was bringing it up more
to now where where patients are already
[SPEAKER_01]: already know about this and are bringing
it up for, for more specialized guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, it's really, you know,
now, of course, that changes in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: demographics, it's her you're,
you're working with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the age range of the patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is their ethnic background?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of setting are they in,
like in a nursing home or hospital or in a
[SPEAKER_01]: community setting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really those variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now I'm in a practice where you
know, cannabis is very prominently
[SPEAKER_01]: featured on our, you know, on our
materials, and people know me for that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I end up getting patients who
already know about it and are more like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I know it can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it, but I don't really know how
to, I need to kind of refine that or I
[SPEAKER_01]: need more guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times patients are bringing it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, that's a that's a great
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next set is going to be all about
refining and patient understanding of how
[SPEAKER_00]: best to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and get this first
commercial out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and be
right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire and my
guest today is hospice and palliative care
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist Dr. Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shaping fire Instagram has follow up
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own garden
insights and best practices from personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grows everywhere and always gorgeous
flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's more that you could do
to reach out to new customers and
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage loyalty in the customers you
already have, but you certainly don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not ready to hire somebody full
time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility, but that's pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important part of marketing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or a
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for
Moontime Medicinals and humbled at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoontimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them, built their
[SPEAKER_00]: website and wrote their sales materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on five
projects now for various of their clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time they have done more
than they have promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me, and that just does not happen every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is hospice and palliative care
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist, Dr. Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, during the first set,
we kind of gave a little background for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who are new to thinking about
end-of-life care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know exactly when it is,
what it is and, you know, what it may take
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the topic started.
[SPEAKER_00]: On cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this set, we're going to talk a lot
more about the how, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As Sunil was talking about before we went
to break, there's a lot of different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to use cannabis and not all of them are
appropriate for each kind of ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we get into those specifics,
I want to point out that there is no way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are going to get through all of
the different ailments and ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can help during this show or
during one of any show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's, I want to refer you to a
handful of Shaping Fire episodes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: already have out that goes in depth into
cannabis use for particular ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So episode 22, you can learn about
treating brain injury with cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 36 is on breathing, COPD and
asthma with cannabis with Dr. Robert,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, with Robert Littman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 57, using cannabis for Parkinson's
with Zoe Sigmund.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 60 on decreasing chronic pain with
cannabis instead of using opioids with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 62 on satisfying sexually with a
chronic disease with a counselor and
[SPEAKER_00]: therapist, Chris Maxwell-Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the recent episode, episode 67 on
treating migraines with cannabis with Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Sunil, you know,
most people think of using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine by smoking a joint, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because that's kind of the picture
that they have in their head from culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really smoking is not usually the
proper form for most patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: both because the dosing comes on so fast
and also most terminal or end of life
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are not usually a location that
smoking is, you know, appropriate because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're likely indoors and perhaps in some
kind of institutional setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people ask you about, well,
Doc, should I get some cannabis flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you interpret that for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I also the other, I say the same
thing you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the fact that with smoking,
it doesn't last as long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be quick to come on, which
actually can be nice and helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, I don't, I try to,
if a patient has the access ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: have vaporizers, access, dry flower
vaporizer or, or clean, a clean oil that's
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizable without pesticides or solvents
and, you know, any excipients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, oils can be vaporized too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inhalation is, can be really effective
when you need relief like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're fast acting and titratable,
you know, as I'm sure your listeners know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there so many advantages of that route?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the disadvantages are, like you said,
context, environment that might not be
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the fact that, you know,
your relief might not be as long lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: because the onset and fall off is short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of educate patients about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if you do smoke, you know,
the Institute of Medicine 99, their
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier report on cannabis and in end of
life care, you know, they said that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, hey, you know, the risks would be
outweighed by the, I mean, the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: would be outweighed by the risks of
smoking in patients who are terminal or
[SPEAKER_01]: end of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really, I mean, if a patient
wants to do that and likes that and likes
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor, the taste, you know,
that approach and they have a setting
[SPEAKER_01]: that's conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, you know,
stop that or get, or cause that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, there are risks like soot,
you know, coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you mentioned the
respiratory sensitive individuals in that
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier show you had on COPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the risks, but if they're
okay with those things, and I still think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worth supporting patients to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very old method of use and it might
be part of their tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be part of their, you know,
the sensual aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't get to mention that in the
last section, that cannabis is also useful
[SPEAKER_01]: for patients at end of life on improving,
you know, their sense of being and well,
[SPEAKER_01]: just overall general psycho-emotional
spiritual wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything that's gonna help connect
them to a tradition or a aroma that feels,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, comforting is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all the big caveat I would say
to patients about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you point that out about the
tradition, culture, and the, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the emotional connection with flower
because it really is different,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it, between people who are learning
about cannabis and starting to use it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time at end of life versus a
lifelong user of cannabis who is using it
[SPEAKER_00]: at end of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have gone to so many patient
events where, you know, you've got these
[SPEAKER_00]: older folks who've been smoking weed their
whole life and, you know, they look so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more at ease and in their realm when
they've got a joint and they're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, as an asthmatic, I'm like,
oh, you know, all that combustion and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, you know, for me, that makes
it harder to breathe and isn't great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see these folks and like it's been
their release from anxiety and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: their social world for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discourage people to, you know,
try to have those people switch to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something else just because they
are, you know, dealing with end of life
[SPEAKER_00]: care because you don't want to take from
them something that they have been using
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively their entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to get the muscle
relaxation, the anti-anxiety, the increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to get the basics,
whether or not they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and combusting a joint or using a
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gosh, you know, let them use it the
way that they want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our philosophies often don't take away
what people it's already working for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe you can add to it or supplement,
you know, as long as it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, then I would educate
patients about the value of tinctures,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or suppositories or method or
oral edible route, you know, if they
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't, that they could add that in and
enhance the benefit that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of how I approach that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's both and, you know, possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before we move on from smoking,
so I guess again, essentially the summary
[SPEAKER_00]: is if there's no health reason for the
patient to stop smoking and they love
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking joints, let them, you know,
go about their way that they always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there are lung issues or if they
might be able to be allowed to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, you know, consider a flower
vaporizer, which, you know, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from so many patients who they
just close their door and they vape in
[SPEAKER_00]: their room in an institution that's
federally funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not allowed, but because,
you know, vaporization isn't smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't get the same kind of attention
from staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, be aware of vaporization
as an option, but don't think it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only option just because somebody's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, capsules are good for many
patients because of the ease of use,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy with the dexterity of the
fingers, you know, to just take a capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: versus, you know, roll a joint or,
you know, take tincture or things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not so good for some folks with
like throat and some stomach issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please speak to your experience about
capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a capsule, basically people talk
about encapsulating in usually like
[SPEAKER_01]: cellulose capsules, various extracts of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just use raw or heated up
flour and ground up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flour or more commonly an oil
extraction like a coconut oil extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your alcohol extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just take a chunk of that and
then fill it into a capsule and there you
[SPEAKER_01]: have an encapsulated cannabis product,
which, you know, as you said, it bypasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the oral mucosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes straight to the stomach and in the
small intestine it absorbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The absorption is more variable,
but it's still, it's longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have, if you take it with a
fatty meal, you know, or oil, drink,
[SPEAKER_01]: sip some oil, it'll improve the absorption
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes, has first pass effect
through the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more potent and if you're
working with a THC, you get 11 hydroxy
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, which is more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can have several hours
of effectiveness and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you had to do was just swallow one
capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think can do a lot of
good for patients for the symptom clusters
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we were talking about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's very, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The swallowing challenges are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some patients or I've heard about
patients that just skipped the,
[SPEAKER_01]: who have feeding tubes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a doctor, a doctor who was a
teacher of mine in medical school and she
[SPEAKER_01]: told me stories how they would just,
in the eighties, somebody who had used
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for nausea, vomiting,
symptom relief, but couldn't swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just, they made an oil and
dripped it into the opening of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the food, the feeding tube.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, sometimes you've got
to just skip the entire upper gut,
[SPEAKER_01]: upper GI and go straight to the opening
that patients use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not heard of that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting things about
capsules and you hit on it just a moment
[SPEAKER_00]: ago that there are, there are some stomach
issues that you have to avoid it because
[SPEAKER_00]: even though cannabis is good for stomach
issues, the capsule itself is irritating
[SPEAKER_00]: for lots of different types of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's weird to say that,
you know, cannabis is great for stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and digestive issues with it,
which it is, but a, a, the method,
[SPEAKER_00]: the capsule itself may be the irritant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, patients, patients and
caregivers, they'll get more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: as, as, as we go with this, you mentioned
a wide range of things that could be in
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules, you know, from, you know,
just, just a flower that has been put into
[SPEAKER_00]: a capsule and, and then oils and then,
and then whatever type of combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: that they might purchase at a,
at a, at a recreational legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably a good idea for us
to mention that if you are interacting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're using capsules that
are homemade versus capsules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: store bought, you're going to want to make
sure that you take, you know, at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these capitals, maybe a few,
if they're, if you think that there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of variability to them and go
ahead and drop them off at a, a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis analytics lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you know, if you don't have one
in your state, you'll have one soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point I'm trying to make is that
dosage is very relevant when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, because, you know, you know,
one of the big aspects of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is repeatability of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a patient who is
taking, you know, a particular dosage of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden they take the
eighth or ninth capsule and, and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're over the moon high because there's
so much variability in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'm a big fan of people,
you know, making their own cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, but would you agree that the,
the repeatability of results is essential
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to this type of care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you, if you can get to a lab,
if there's, if you're in a state where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have access as a patient or as a consumer,
why not utilize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know how much, you know,
at least the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other testing for safety too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you got it from someplace and
you're not sure of the pesticide content
[SPEAKER_01]: or heavy metal residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are also important for safety
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then potency is great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can know, okay, I'm, I'm trying to,
I want to get five milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 milligrams of CBD, or I want to have a
high THC, low CBD, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want to some places offer
terpene testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those kinds of things will give you a
chance to, to understand more about what
[SPEAKER_01]: your responsiveness is and what you might
need to adjust to maximize the response
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's very, it's very helpful
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it's hard to some places don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the testing is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the draw, the limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and while we're talking about
limitations, let's, let's hit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations of capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already hit on the fact that,
that the actual act of swallowing them can
[SPEAKER_00]: be an impediment for many patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the, the putting them together,
the actual physical capping them up is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very likely going to be something that
is going to be difficult for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gosh, it's, it's also very possible
that it's going to be difficult for the
[SPEAKER_00]: family members too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause making caps is not the easiest thing
unless you've got, you know, very fully
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning flangies, you know,
and, and there is a capsule making
[SPEAKER_01]: machines you can get, which we sometimes
patients benefit from simplifying their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like an auto auto capper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, for somebody who is
working in end of life care and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be immediate, that might be,
that may make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing, the biggest drawback for me
when recommending capsules to patients
[SPEAKER_00]: though, is the fact that you're,
you're kind of tied to the preset dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of variability in dosing
from day to day based on the patient's
[SPEAKER_00]: needs so they can titrate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this tincture has become very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you seen as far as like the,
the benefits of a patient being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: control their dosage up or down based on
their day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's, that's very beneficial,
especially when you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling with getting your regimen right
or you're in the early phases for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for patients who, you know, kind of
already know what their, what their sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: spot is, what they're, you know,
about amount of medicine that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve their whatever symptom or,
you know, global cluster they're treating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's capsules, you know,
can be a simple sort of fix, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't really nailed that down,
there's nothing like the tincture to
[SPEAKER_01]: really help to kind of play with,
okay, let me half a milliliter here or
[SPEAKER_01]: there or quarter mill increments just to
kind of see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, we call that auto titration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it was this, it was a back in the
day when we were still fighting where,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we can even, you know,
have medical marijuana and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: states that we have it now, it was all
this, you know, they would be this,
[SPEAKER_01]: the conservative establishment would say,
oh, well, gosh, you know, there's no,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no single dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what kind of medicine is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then we'd go back and say,
well, no, this is even, this is called
[SPEAKER_01]: auto titration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually, you and the patient can
self adjust their dose based on what they,
[SPEAKER_01]: what their need is and how they respond
because there's so much very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: variability in, you know, each individual
patient's endocannabinoid tone,
[SPEAKER_01]: their absorption, their metabolism of
different cannabinoids, and they're based
[SPEAKER_01]: on their, their genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's really a, it's a huge asset
to, to cannabis medicine to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to safely, you know, have little
slight scales of, you know, sliding,
[SPEAKER_01]: dose sliding scales, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting too, how different
patients use that variability,
[SPEAKER_00]: that slide sliding scale differently than
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I have seen about the same
number of patients who have a smaller dose
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC and a higher dose of CBG and CBD in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then maybe a little bit more by
daytime as their body is getting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by evening, when they've already,
you know, visited with their family and
[SPEAKER_00]: done whatever they have to productive or
whatever during the day and they get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the evening, they increase their dosage to
decrease the, the stress on their body and
[SPEAKER_00]: just make their body more inhabitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in that example where you start
slow and you increase the dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day, I've seen just as many
patients go the opposite way where they
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up in a great amount of discomfort
because for many of them, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's from, you know, sleeping or,
or being horizontal and not sitting up or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wake up in a great deal of
discomfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start the day heavily and
then, and then they slow down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and then, and then they increase again
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've, they can increase their
cannabinoid load before they go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that kind of variability,
which, um, a lot of patients love about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just not really offered these
options as a doctor in your situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can really go up and down and,
and give the patient so much control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go that you've been able to see that
kind of a range of variable usage and
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just so fantastic to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so when you are explaining,
uh, uh, um, variability of dosage,
[SPEAKER_00]: individualized medicine, and, and that the
patients in control for, for, for most
[SPEAKER_00]: patients throughout their life,
their relationship's been with the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the doctor tells you how much to
take and you're not supposed to deviate
[SPEAKER_00]: from that, but we all know that we all
pretty much deviate from what the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: tells us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we often are not clean about that
with our doctor because we, because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're an authority figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, how do you go about explaining
to a patient that they are in control of
[SPEAKER_00]: this medicine and they can take as much or
as little as they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you kind of get them past the taboo
that they are in control and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do it the way, um,
the way that they're being told?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, um, a lot of what I've,
uh, I'm coming from this integrative
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine background, you know,
where, um, uh, people are used to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, having a little bit more
autonomy or a little more involvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: their healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that, that certain type of
consumer or patient that, that has
[SPEAKER_01]: already, uh, you know, uh, learned to
listen to their body and, and to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to be more active in that,
uh, in their suit and cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional plant medicine, natural
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, people grew their
own and, and, and made their own products
[SPEAKER_01]: for thousands of years, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think it's just, um,
um, you know, just reminding people that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not, um, kryptonite, uh,
and that it's not going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take too much and then you're going to
go to the, you know, fatal overdose and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, something like that,
like might happen if you're, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, trying, um, some other more
higher risk profile natural substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there, there are definitely,
you know, if you take too much detour or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you know,
you can have a really significant reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: or other types of plant medicines that
have value, but, but also have a narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's emphasizing the safety,
um, you know, from the medical standpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, we, we're fighting, you know,
decades and decades of, of political,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and you know, health, political,
public, politicized public health
[SPEAKER_01]: messaging on the, uh, um, you know,
uh, extremely severe dangers of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that even one, you know, micro fragment is
enough to, you know, um, be so dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: to society that somebody needs to be put
away in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, that, that kind of
reinforces the, that fear and that can,
[SPEAKER_01]: that like, let me be very, very cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I would say is that there
has been a kind of a proliferation of para
[SPEAKER_01]: educators, um, para health professional
educators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, who, who helped patients, um,
with, with dosing, uh, with titration,
[SPEAKER_01]: with kind of feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's having, having somebody
who you can kind of work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, who can help kind of guide you in a
more, you know, definitely you can still,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still in control, but it's still
nice to have a back and forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to, to check yourself with,
to get other ideas, other, other
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions of medicine and product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've, I've found valuable for
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I can refer them to, um,
a company or an educator, um, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, doing that work and coming from
a patient advocacy standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're trying to empower with
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, uh, that's another way to kind
of be in the, in, in between ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the doctor and the patient
can be like a team of, um, with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with health educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that we keep on coming back to this
team approach, uh, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: while this is becoming more and more
popular, historically, it's not really how
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans have interacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the medical establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that the, the more
examples you give, uh, the more apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that this, this level of care that
hospice patients are getting is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, um, that, and it's so effective
that it would really be great if,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we all had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so let's talk about this last
category of methods for using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and, and that's suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while, you know, while he always gets
giggles when, when I speak about it
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly, um, um, when push comes to
shove, um, it can, it can, it can cause so
[SPEAKER_00]: much symptom relief that it brings
patients to tears because they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone through all of these
different, um, pharmaceuticals and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they, they didn't reach the needs that
they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then everybody tells them they
should try, you know, cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and generally, you know,
suppositories are not the first things
[SPEAKER_00]: suggested by friends, you know,
so they go through, they go through
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and maybe they'll go through
capsules and maybe they'll go through
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're finally like,
what the hell, you know, none of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is working for me, but it's supposed
to work and it was working for other
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but because of their particular
health issues, you know, these other
[SPEAKER_00]: methods are not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can take an oil and,
and make it into a suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you insert it rectally,
the, the, the capsule or the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil, uh, some people use like a,
like a frozen, um, uh, frozen oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I don't know, pill, I guess I'd
consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then that melts and the,
the, uh, the tissues on the walls of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rectum will absorb the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the two biggest benefits that I
find that are unique to it as number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it skips the stomach and, and whatever
kind of problems could be going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach, but also, um, you can take a
higher dosage of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, as a suppository than you can
otherwise for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you see it actually play out
first person?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess suppositories are rare enough
that you, that you may not have seen much
[SPEAKER_00]: of this firsthand, but, but, uh,
but perhaps you have, so what are your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, I think you've pretty much
said it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, we don't have as much, you know,
like a pharmacological, pharmacological
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pharmacokinetic is what it's called
where, you know, you look at absorption
[SPEAKER_01]: and you kind of calculate how much is in
the bloodstream as a function of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you put into the, into the suppository.
[SPEAKER_01]: That data is there as much as we have with
other routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little, there's a little bit
more of, um, you know, individualized or
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotally driven, um, recommendation
pattern, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, um, it's just, we just need
more learn to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, um, like, for example,
I think, you know, the, the absorbent
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of CBD might be higher than THC,
or actually I think the THC we have better
[SPEAKER_01]: data on than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it that way in terms of
absorption from the, even the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb from the rectum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then the other, there are other
issues with, um, um, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: placing it in the right level in the,
in the rectum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's, there's actually like,
um, some, the, the blood supply and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a, there's a, there's a,
like a line of tissue that separates one,
[SPEAKER_01]: one level of the rectum from another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be some, some people might
need even deeper insertion for better
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption, but then, you know,
you really want to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have anything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to cost any, any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like it should really just be a
dissolving, um, you know, like bullet
[SPEAKER_01]: shape type, um, like oil, oil object.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the suppositories can be, there's more
of an art to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I, I think, um, I,
I think you, you, you, you, it's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, smoking where you do bypass a
lot of the liver effects at the first
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but you also get the longevity of
effect of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also very, can be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, um, I have a less
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have patients that certainly use
cannabis suppositories and they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have, we prescribe other medicines
via suppositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, not a new, new method to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we don't have as much data
on it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting helping patients
and their families, you know, once they've
[SPEAKER_00]: decided that suppositories are going to be
their solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's amazing how much I've learned
about suppositories just from trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help, uh, families figure out how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there, there are suppository
kits online on eBay that you can pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like, um, you know, they just,
they look like ice make ice trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and people are putting, you know,
a little, a little squirt of cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: from a syringe and a little bit of shea
butter and a little bit of coconut oil in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tossing them in the freezer,
which is like a really, really basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and you know, they, they get
harder and then once they take them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they've got a few moments to,
um, introduce it to the body before it
[SPEAKER_00]: warms up and gets, uh, soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that's always an interesting
experience for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to have something so chilly down
there, but, uh, but, um, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I find that more and more people are
realizing that a lot of, um, just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: old capsules, like you'd buy at the
pharmacy, just like empty, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: number three capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they as well will, um, disintegrate in
the rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really doesn't have to,
you don't really necessarily have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: down this path of, you know, building your
own reinventing suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, you know, it's a, it's a whole
rabbit hole of its own, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, um, we need more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think I'm really happy to hear
that patients are making their own
[SPEAKER_01]: products and exploring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think a lot of folks are also
interested in this for disease
[SPEAKER_01]: modification, you know, to get the higher
number of milligrams to see if that will
[SPEAKER_01]: help to change the course of their cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I just, I think it's harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more information to find out
exactly how much is coming out of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, into the bloodstream so that we can,
um, you know, help guide better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's going to be,
we're going to find it's not, it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: not everything absorbs the same way that,
um, that, that you get in the small
[SPEAKER_01]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, um, it's going to be,
um, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hopefully somebody is going to do
that, those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what, what advice do you have for
folks who are going to use different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods together?
[SPEAKER_00]: So say they're going to use capsules and
smoking or vaporizing and a tincture or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, one of the others in
suppositories, um, uh, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in taking them these different
ways, you have issues with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: timing of when it hits your body and also
having to do the math of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a, you know, a lot of
experience with, you know, a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines and stacking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so how do you teach that to
patients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's pretty much like,
uh, uh, you want to have what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with end of life patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of there's a lot, oftentimes a
lot of symptom burden that's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be there throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's useful to have a kind of a
workhorse, you know, something that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, giving you a steady state,
um, or more, you know, long acting effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like we talked about,
you know, tinctures or capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you can think of other
methods, uh, vaping, uh, and even
[SPEAKER_01]: suppositories as kind of, um, a shorter
acting like breakthrough or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you can layer on top of
that, uh, longer acting workhorse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to think of it that way to help
patients understand that there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to kind of need at the base,
at the basal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what else do you need when,
when you need something beyond that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that, that, that's,
that's sort of a good way to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a, that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have, have the one be your central
solution and then have, have these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these extras that you might add as,
as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you normally recommend that
patients, uh, keep some sort of dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: journal too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's very helpful, especially when
you're trying to figure things out and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing what's working and not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course with the, you know,
this is a complex botanical medicine with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's not just one active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more you also know about,
you know, what, what percentage or
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency or potency material you're
putting in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making note of that, um, quantity and
time of day, um, will, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and if you have, you know,
you can put on the other, on the columns,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, these are the symptoms I'm treating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and this is what it was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it was after in terms of,
um, you know, severity on a one to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that kind of data, uh,
can be really, you can look at,
[SPEAKER_01]: do that over like five days and get a lot
of information and show that to your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to whoever's helping you,
um, with, with dosing and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, cause it can become comp,
it can become a lot, but this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: really to help, you know, make sense of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many products is the
problem too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people kind of get overwhelmed and
that's where, um, you know, starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: at least like one, you know, this one and
then, and then another layer on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then keeping, keeping notes will,
will help to, um, simplify this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is just, just the idea
is just to sort of dial us in so that then
[SPEAKER_01]: you, now you can, you know, move on with
your life, you know, and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and do the things that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I didn't mention in
the, in the previous section about the
[SPEAKER_01]: details on cannabis is an end of life
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there, there, there may not be
like, um, a set dosing pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, it might be like, you know,
people just are finding something that
[SPEAKER_01]: helps them with their mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they, they, they just,
they use that or they, they use it when
[SPEAKER_01]: they like to, because, um, you know,
their mood varies throughout the day or
[SPEAKER_01]: their, their level of interaction with
people changes, or they get, they get
[SPEAKER_01]: fatigued after a certain amount of time,
or they use it for energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it can just be a really like,
okay, let me just have these on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I kind of know what they all do
and what they're all good for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let me just sort of mix and match,
you know, so that that's also another
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't want to like make it so
complicated and like a program,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it should, it should be a chance
to also have a spontaneous, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of empowerment toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that an empowerment toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it's not uncommon to
hear from a patient, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: three months into this process that,
uh, the cannabis just isn't working like
[SPEAKER_00]: it used to anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and, you know, it's one of the
challenges with cannabis medicine that
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, the human body can develop
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, would you explain a little bit about,
uh, tolerance to cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you, what kind of advice you give
your, um, patients about, uh, manipulating
[SPEAKER_00]: their doses or taking tolerance breaks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I've got my colleague,
uh, Dr. Dustin Sulak in Maine,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is an amazing osteopathic physician
and cannabis researcher and scholar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he has made such a nice, um,
like websites and patient literature and
[SPEAKER_01]: videos about his, um, resensitization
protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just always refer my patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please go listen to Dr. Sulak's,
um, lectures or videos about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a website, healer.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I just have him do the
explanation, but I mean, what he explained
[SPEAKER_01]: to people basically in a, in a bottom line
is that, you know, your CB1 receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: even CB2, but any receptor, which is the
protein on the cells that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the surface of the cells, like nerve
cells, for example, that, um, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids from cannabis, um,
you know, bind to and signal through to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the downstream effect of modulating
excitability, whether it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, overactive pain circuits,
overactive vomiting circuit, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, boosting up the activity of
a, of a neurons that are involved in mood
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or slowing down the activity of
neurons that are involved in negative
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts, all that kind of modulation that
is through those receptors, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: through tickling or binding to those
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you just keep pushing
and pushing and pushing cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for a long period of time,
those receptors can get desensitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that means that they just,
they don't make as many of them or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, um, it's usually that,
like they just kind of come back into
[SPEAKER_01]: them, into the cell membrane rather than
being out there ready to receive signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's a dynamic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you kind of take a break from the
cannabinoid exposure or the holidays,
[SPEAKER_01]: follow different protocols that Dr. Shulak
has advised, you can really just
[SPEAKER_01]: resensitize the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can kind of reboot nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's the, that's the solution
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and on the extreme, sometimes you
take too much, not only is it not working,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can actually make things worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something called the cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome, which is more rare,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see it in my practice and I,
we, we think that there's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the body is like having an over overactive
immune response to all these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and ends up making an antibody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one theory that kind of might be
blocking the, um, the receptors and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and ending up giving you more nausea
and vomiting rather than less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's kind of the, um,
everything is in moderation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's where I, if, uh,
if cannabis isn't working as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's also possible that, um, they,
you know, um, other therapies might be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, cannabis is not a complete
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly a holistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do a lot of things, but there are
also other, other natural medicines out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and other strategies, um,
that, um, you know, can, can, can
[SPEAKER_01]: synergize with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other thing I would say
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take that and go the other
direction with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, um, interaction with other
drugs have you seen in your practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, between, um, you know, the
pharmaceuticals that there may be and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, and then using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the most, the most, um, common one
that I see in my type of practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is the combination of cannabinoids and
opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this is opioids from, are derived
from opium poppy, uh, like morphine,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and coding, um, uh, and, and then
derivatives from the Bain, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: another ingredient anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there's a whole class of opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people have heard about hydro
hydrocodone, hydro morphine, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Dilaud and fentanyl,
the long list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those medicines can be helpful for pain,
but if they're the only ones you rely on,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have also significant problems with
tolerance, um, with, um, dependency with
[SPEAKER_01]: the constipation, um, with suppression of
adrenal access with long-term use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's any way that you can make
the dosing of those more effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, that you take cannabinoids
and layer that with opioids and the pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief is synergistic or greater or last
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the, um, one of the drug
interactions that is very positive and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually has been studied in clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know it's a real phenomenon and it
actually probably makes opioids safer
[SPEAKER_01]: because the blood level of the opioids
also comes down, which lowers the chance
[SPEAKER_01]: for having an overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of a big one that I
see a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's many, there's long tables
of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug interactions and if of cannabinoids,
one of the ones that was really pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: out with the introduction of high dose CBD
on the market, Epidiolex, the tincture of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, cannabis that is used in seizure
disorders, uh, FDA approved for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, they go on pretty high doses or
they can go on a pretty high doses of CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: like hundreds and hundreds of milligrams
per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that level, um, it can impact your
ability to metabolize other anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines that your doctor might've
prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is called colobazam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as well known or our trade name is on
fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take a lot of CBD, um,
with on fee, the on fee levels become more
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have to be monitored more
closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, that's been shown in these
studies and you know, that, that does come
[SPEAKER_01]: up from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have patients who, who have seizure
disorders who come to see me for advice
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're, they're taking on fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always monitor the blood levels of
on fee while we're titrating up
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, um, so that, you know,
we know that we're in a safe range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it's, it's kind of like on,
on one hand, I can count the sort of some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the major issues in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids play well with others from
most medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think it's, um, it's just a
matter of, um, uh, what can, what can you
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Therapeutically, I think there's a lot
more to talk about in terms of what can
[SPEAKER_01]: you mix it with or what can it help to,
to reduce the amount of reliance on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a purist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's nice to use other medicines
if you need them, but maybe cannabis will
[SPEAKER_01]: help to reduce the dose of those
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, were you done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, during the set, third set,
we're going to talk about, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to use cannabis medicine in real
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we've talked a lot about,
you know, the theoreticals and the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, but after the set or after the
break, we're going to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, resistance by the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And resistance by the care facility,
which, which is its own thing to tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is hospice and
palliative care specialist, Dr. Sunil
[SPEAKER_00]: Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of his lineage and the hard earned
experience that comes from growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long time heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and ask around Caleb,
also known as inspector and pirates of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald triangle is a breeders breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_00]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, all the seeds will be
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Vashon Island and everyone was
pleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to call half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a moment right now and visit Humboldt
CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an up to date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_00]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Humboldt CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls have come a long way since the
early days of normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you choose Saints joints,
you are smoking all flower top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls with terpenes that will sculpt
your high in a way that dry old pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas most brands release pre-rolls as
an afterthought, for the last five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints has focused on their line of
exotic curated joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while some companies just chase the
hype strains, Saints joints goes deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching out hard to find strains,
unexpected crosses and nearly forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: land races and classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some hype ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does a joint from Saints smoke
incredibly well, they have fine tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: every step of the process so you don't get
runs in the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joint is just the right density to
have a nice pull and the joint stays lit,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you get a bit chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints boxes are works of art and
will spark conversation when you pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: out at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints award-winning boxes change with
every release, feature edgy outsider art
[SPEAKER_00]: and often raise awareness of important
issues like equal rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints boxes are so desired that many
collect them and display them in their
[SPEAKER_00]: homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your bud tender for Saints joints and
have a premium joint experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are a licensed cannabis
cultivator, I have an extra message for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints is looking for partners in legal
cannabis states to expand the availability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Saints joints brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow exceptional canvas flower but
are less excited about all the effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost and risk of launching your own brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Saints joints may be just the partner you
are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already established in California,
Washington and Oklahoma and recognized by
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneur magazine and green
entrepreneur as a cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: leader, the Saints joints brand will set
you apart in your home market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing I can recommend is for you
to visit their Instagram at Saints joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at their patented drawer design
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Become that brand everyone is talking
about without having to build it from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Instagram at Saints joints
and then visit saints joints.com to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In times like these, when so many cannabis
companies are growing their flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic warehouses and fields using
synthetic nutrients, it is good to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are authentic California
heritage growers using natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and sunshine to cultivate
cannabis flowers for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has produced the best cannabis
in the world for generations and the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that massively scaled industrial cannabis
production could produce the same quality
[SPEAKER_00]: as small batch lovingly cultivated flowers
is just silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is located in Humboldt
County on the lush South Fork of the Eel
[SPEAKER_00]: River watershed in the epicenter of the
American cannabis heartland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals grows under bright
California sun in greenhouses using only
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming techniques like
hugelkultur, compost teas, whole food
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every part of their growing process plays
its own part in nature and nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic is injected into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is big beautiful cannabis
flowers with wide ranging terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste like great cannabis should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in California, ask your
budtender for Moontime Medicinals and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit Moontime Medicinals on the web and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals is also available as
part of the Redwood Roots family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime's whole flowers appear in Redwood
Roots curated joint packs alongside other
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage cannabis cultivators like Lady
Sativa Farm, Ridgeline Farms, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwood Healing and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moontime Medicinals, top shelf cannabis
grown in harmony with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los and our guest
this week is hospice and palliative care
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist, Dr. Sunil Agarwal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sunil, you know, we've talked a lot so
far about, you know, the why and the how
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis medicine in kind of like an
idealized environment, but we both know
[SPEAKER_00]: that when it gets down to the moment of
helping a patient, there are challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: and hoops that we have to jump through to
make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one on that list is usually
resistance by the family, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've had, you know, what 70 plus
years of federal resistance to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and it's taboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people do not feel
comfortable having their parent or loved
[SPEAKER_00]: one using cannabis, which they are
unfamiliar with and may have some societal
[SPEAKER_00]: beliefs against.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure you probably run into that all
the time because you have such an
[SPEAKER_00]: integrative approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use a lot of stuff that people don't
even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you normally approach a
family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you normally, I guess this probably has
a lot to do with the state of the patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm just going to kind of set it up
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you normally talk to the patient first
or the family first?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you know that cannabis is going to be
a helpful thing if used properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you go about introducing it and
working with a family that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I always try to do is to
name what the barrier is in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And putting a name on it makes it a little
bit more tangible, understandable,
[SPEAKER_01]: contextualizes it into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a larger social fabric of a patient
and family's life, you know, other issues
[SPEAKER_01]: in society where we face discrimination
based on, you know, age, gender,
[SPEAKER_01]: race, religion, all the different things
that unfortunately we still are living
[SPEAKER_01]: with and are trying to systemically
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that term is stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue of stigma, which is tied to
shame and fear and ostracization,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what stigma comes from,
this idea of being marked, a stigmata,
[SPEAKER_01]: a mark that kind of makes you,
you know, ostracized or socially outcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a stigma of cannabis that
persists and that was engineered or pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: by the government for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there wasn't, there's always been
kind of in puritanical settings some
[SPEAKER_01]: concern about substances that change your
ordinary state of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think people just need to
understand that that can be done safely
[SPEAKER_01]: and appropriately in any accepted context
that's safe and healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, after you talk about,
you say this is stigma that you're facing
[SPEAKER_01]: and if a patient tells me that they're,
you know, they'd love to try this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're loved one is really like,
doesn't see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, they'll put limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some loved ones, patients who
tell me, oh, well, you know, my siblings,
[SPEAKER_01]: older siblings, so somebody who has a
lifelong disability, she has siblings
[SPEAKER_01]: that's looked after, also looked after
her, but one of the siblings is really in
[SPEAKER_01]: favor of cannabis, the other ones are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they kind of like don't go as far
as they could go in terms of what could
[SPEAKER_01]: help the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like that, I come across and I
always tell patients, listen, I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a family meeting, you know,
a conversation with your family members to
[SPEAKER_01]: help them address their concerns or
questions that they have about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stigma and it's something that we
should talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually grounded in some ignorance
or, you know, lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's fear too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of the other angle is that
sometimes the fear is sort of warranted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in terms of like actions or
actual legal repercussions that can befall
[SPEAKER_01]: a family or a patient that they're
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's where, you know,
and that's where the other context around,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what is it exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the legal issues here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the, you know, who's making the
rules and who's enforcing those rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any way we can find medical
exemptions or exceptions or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing that angle of medical care where
you have to advocate for a patient's
[SPEAKER_01]: rights or their patient's needs,
you know, and if the laws and rules are
[SPEAKER_01]: impinging on medicine, then, you know,
what social worker do we need to call?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which lawyer do we need to call?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do we need to write a letter to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can we, you know,
overcome that barrier?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of how I, family
conversation, identifying stigma,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with the family, inviting,
you know, educating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if there are real
barriers like legal or administrative
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers, trying to address those with a
team approach and medical and letters if
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting how, you know,
even though the family is coming to you
[SPEAKER_00]: for expert advice, how often they will
then try to create the ground rules for
[SPEAKER_00]: within which you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, you know, it's not
uncommon for a family to say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're okay with cannabis medicine,
but only CBD and not THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't really understand that THC
even at low doses that don't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: euphoria are still, you know, THC is
generally going to be part of a healing
[SPEAKER_00]: process when it comes to cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's those, those kind of the,
the CBD only like is a THC stigma is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is even more specific, you know,
and, and, and that's all and so it
[SPEAKER_01]: requires the same approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, when you need to interact with a
family and, and, and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, let's do a family meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it's hard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've got all these different
communication styles of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might, you know, the patient
probably knows you decently and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe the, the spouse or maybe the
one, the one child who is kind of running
[SPEAKER_00]: point for the family knows you pretty
well, but then you've got all these new
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the room or on the zoom call or
whatever, and they don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you're like, oh my gosh,
how, how am I going to communicate to this
[SPEAKER_00]: room where I've got all these varying
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, how do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these are, these are things that
they teach us a little bit about in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in hospice and palliative medicine
training, fellowship training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's really just, the research
shows that the more that family members
[SPEAKER_01]: speak in meetings, have an opportunity to,
to actually be heard and to, to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to speak with them being spoken to
improves their, their satisfaction with
[SPEAKER_01]: the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's, it's really more about
creating a venue, a space, a platform for
[SPEAKER_01]: family members to listen to each other
and, and to be heard about their concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, asking open ended questions,
and, you know, certainly leading the
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting, but giving a lot of space for
people to kind of state their concerns
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, you know, and then if there are
emotional aspects in that, in their
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns, oftentimes there are very strong
emotional issues, fear, like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioning, or, you know, the shame or the
tied to stigma or whatever it might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, naming those, naming those
emotions, like I can, I can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear your frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear that you're worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that helps to improve the,
the communication, name, name the concerns
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, start to hopefully move
towards, you know, if, if this is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: something a patient needs and then being
the advocate for the patient as a doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, giving the advice,
that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, seeing what people
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's how, that's how to
approach those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, there's an art to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that clinical doctors that
has, there's one of the key tools in their
[SPEAKER_00]: toolbox is communication skills,
because certainly somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with family all the time is
going to need a different version of
[SPEAKER_00]: communication skills than a, you know,
a research doctor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who, who still needs to know how to
interact with people, but it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: different dealing with the folks in a lab
versus a family member who are dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with a end of life patient, because
they've got all their own emotions are all
[SPEAKER_00]: on like hyper then, because they're,
they're freaked out and, and, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to review their life's history with
this person and they got their own taboos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a soup of a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that is our, in my field,
hospice and palliative care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communication is really one of the
critical skillsets that we work on because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very important to, you know,
to deal with, to, to even figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with the patient,
how you can better help their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their distress levels or the family,
or sometimes I'm involved in helping them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, develop the care goals,
like whether they should go this way,
[SPEAKER_01]: take that treatment, take this treatment,
you know, or focus more on a, on a fully
[SPEAKER_01]: palliative approach, like trying to sort
that out requires a lot of ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the various competing,
you know, interests that are involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to center that what the patient's
values are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it is a, it's, you know,
and in general, I would say when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis discussions and talking about
this stigma, if people are ready to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down and talk about it, or we've already
made huge progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when, you know, the state of
Washington had no legal access to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you know, until this law passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had medical marijuana,
but they didn't have adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the big campaign that the
ACLU ran was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a conversation, you know,
and it was this, this whole idea,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can sit down and talk about this,
you know, we can sort of change some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our preconceived notions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that was kind of a brilliant
stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same thing is true in the
individual context with family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is often frustrating because even when
you have a family that is totally into it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're, you know, they're modern,
they're open minded, and they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about what's best for the
patient, then you've got resistance from
[SPEAKER_00]: the care facility because generally they
accept federal money and therefore are
[SPEAKER_00]: beholden to federal laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that as a, you know,
integrative caregiver, running up against
[SPEAKER_00]: that barrier causes you unending amounts
of frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, again, as I mentioned
earlier in our podcast, I have seen a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of change in the greater healthcare
environment, residential care facility
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in the 20 years or so that
I've been thinking about this topic and
[SPEAKER_01]: being in a clinical setting, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, so, and so to add to that,
like, I've had examples of where I've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, privately owned chains of assisted
living or end of life residential care
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, which have a lot of older
population, like one I'll just name is
[SPEAKER_01]: Aegis Living, A-E-G-I-S, Aegis Living,
they're a huge, they're in multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, like, I would say five years ago or
something like that worked out a policy
[SPEAKER_01]: for, you know, allowing cannabis in their
facility and having, I've seen other
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities that are privately owned also
that allow their nurses to handle cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that patients bring in, you know,
their care staff if they're getting help
[SPEAKER_01]: with medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've kind of interacted with
clusters of facilities that chose to not
[SPEAKER_01]: be beholden to some of the federal rules,
even though their patients might be on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Medicare or receiving some
federal benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably because they're,
you know, independent or largely
[SPEAKER_01]: independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's always still some
overlap.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some federal regulations,
state regulations involved in all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, you know, and so it's just a
matter of like, well, is it enough to make
[SPEAKER_01]: a difference or are we just using that as
an excuse, you know, to just sort of pump
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been I've been very heartened
by the fact that some of these facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: develop their own internal policies in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say no to smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say no non-smoked products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say that the patient needs to have
medical cannabis authorization and that
[SPEAKER_01]: things need to be labeled and this and
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, sometimes security around
the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I mean, like a secure,
secure storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's where I think I've seen
some changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other place that I struggle a
lot on this with was the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the hospital is really like the
the center of, you know, advanced high
[SPEAKER_01]: tech medical care and lots of regulations
on hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, many times patients would
sneak things in and just sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the hospital didn't want the
liability of saying, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had something happen to you and it's a
medicine that we did not give you or
[SPEAKER_01]: authorized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just don't want you on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of like legal impasse
prevented a lot of, you know, acceptance
[SPEAKER_01]: and stigmatizing environment to use
cannabis and even though when patients
[SPEAKER_01]: might be hospitalized for things where
cannabis could actually help their
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, you know, oftentimes prescribe
like THC pills, you know, to patients from
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a way to, you know, use some aspect
of cannabis in a legal hospital,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a legal framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but now I've seen there are some
hospitals that are allowing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: their in their wards, not everywhere,
but it's changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had patients at Children's Hospital in
the last couple of years where they also
[SPEAKER_01]: are allowing children to bring in cannabis
that their parents are bringing in and
[SPEAKER_01]: administering as long as they've had
they've gone through some kind of approval
[SPEAKER_01]: process that they have on the inside,
which goes through their pediatric
[SPEAKER_01]: attending doctor and some regulatory
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it changes the the stigma
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The child now, you know, and family
members don't have to hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's, you know, on I've had some
patients where they put it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, their family members are writing
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's been kind of a changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an opening there happening,
I would say, in the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I contacted the Department of
Health in Washington and they had said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you know, we don't have any problems
to patients using cannabis in facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's not it's not anything that the
state of Washington is limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they they have granted these
rights to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, it's kind of a there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of that said, there are definitely
facilities that are still out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: are far more tied into federal pools of
money and just say, hey, we don't allow
[SPEAKER_01]: that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those cases, patients have to be,
you know, discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably a good point for us to
give a loving shout out to nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no doubt that nurses,
their creativity and hearts and knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: are there at the center of these decisions
between the doctor and the family and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so often I have come across nurses
who are like, OK, I've got a patient who
[SPEAKER_00]: uses cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in hospice, but they're moving
into the facility now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to move their medicine into
the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the methods that are most
discreet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I play that role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can share with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's for them and the family to
decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nurses play such an important role in
making sure that the patient gets the care
[SPEAKER_00]: that the patient wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen to nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have definitely played a critical
role.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one nurse who's been a huge leader
in a national, you know, American Nurses
[SPEAKER_01]: Association's largest organization of
nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name is Mary Lynn Mathri.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has been a huge leader from for
decades on cannabis and medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting professional education,
doing her own research about her own
[SPEAKER_01]: master's research when she was in grad
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grad school about cannabis and,
you know, talking to doctors and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to have open lines of
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to shout out to Mary Lynn
because and of course, many, many nurses
[SPEAKER_01]: have now come forth and started Cannabis
Nursing Associations and all across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've really taken the mantle on to
advocate for patients and to kind of help
[SPEAKER_01]: them toe that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For family members who are listening,
who are thinking about going in this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction with their with their family,
I highly recommend finding a nurse that is
[SPEAKER_00]: educated and pro cannabis as an ally,
because, you know, you're not going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's going to be more effective
towards winning than then align with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good nurse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so Sunil, before we wrap up here,
you know, I've heard you speak a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I really enjoy
is is when you get to the part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation where you talk about human
beings having a right to use healing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, certainly cannabis has
been, you know, taboo for many decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, you know, it was 70% of
the pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used it for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then it fell out of favor and with
the government because it was it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, used as a scare tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so now everything's kind of a
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's and it's slowly coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end, you know, this is a plant
that's naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just like to you to speak
to the idea that that that that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's something that we should have
as an option as a patient at any point in
[SPEAKER_00]: our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no I don't think there's I
don't think there's much else to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just simply the fact that we are I
mean, in my area of interest is a human
[SPEAKER_01]: environment relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's I came I came into medicine
having background in geography,
[SPEAKER_01]: a human environment relationship and how
it applies to health and disease to access
[SPEAKER_01]: the resources, the therapeutic resources,
the healing power of natural landscapes
[SPEAKER_01]: and nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all this critical ecology
that that that we're part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: determines, you know, illness and access
to health resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's health health and the environment
is integral to our, you know, to who we
[SPEAKER_01]: are as humans, to our evolution,
our connection to all other life on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a it is a we are cannabis and
humans are and all these these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like distant cousins on the
evolutionary like, you know, tree of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it to me was always very, you know,
the idea that you have a natural right to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the bounties or the natural
plant resources is a very old concept in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't know, I think it's
called natural rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the idea that the state that what
is the compelling interest of the state to
[SPEAKER_01]: limit somebody's right to access,
you know, natural resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you know, that's a social
contract question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, you know, what limits are
there for, for example, safety or resource
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you might say, oh,
well, you know, if everybody took all the
[SPEAKER_01]: firewood from this area, then the wood,
you know, it collected as much as they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted, then then there'd be no none,
none left for for everyone's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there has to be a limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you say, you know, I don't want
people collecting this particular rare,
[SPEAKER_01]: rare bird or you know, making these kind
of endangered species pets, because this
[SPEAKER_01]: this species at risk of extinction,
there's this huge, you know, global social
[SPEAKER_01]: reason to withhold, you know, trading and
endangered species and conserving
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that are very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, you know, that's
pretty much the limits that we play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then I guess the other one
would be like, how much ricin can you
[SPEAKER_01]: make?
[SPEAKER_01]: ricin is a, you know, naturally occurring
like bio terrorism, biotoxin that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: you can grow from plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's limits on that for the
safety of people's ability to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be free from bioterrorism
attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really the idea that there's
these plant medicines that are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: so dangerous for you that, you know,
so you're going to abuse them so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're so unsafe, and we have to take
them away from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of the that's the sort of
overreach that infringes on that natural
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have to really, you know,
ask the question, is there is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: compelling interest of the government to
limit this, you know, natural connection,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or to completely in the case of
cannabis, or in these other natural
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, like completely, you know,
remove it from entirely sever the
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship, you know, like, legally
speaking, there's no legal context,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no legal way that you can have a
connection with these, these natural
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's that to me is,
is, is what it comes down to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do we really think that that's a that's a
valid reach of our government?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a compelling and that that
comes down to well, what is the argument
[SPEAKER_01]: they're making?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying it's very unsafe and
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, you know, been proven
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and you know, the fact that there's a
long traditional history of use already
[SPEAKER_01]: should have proven that long, a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's the mess that
you talked about, you know, that we kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of took these political, we took these
allowed the government to take these steps
[SPEAKER_01]: of overreach for naked racist,
political, economic interest purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure some people along the way
were convinced that there was some real
[SPEAKER_01]: danger here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing this to, you know,
save the children to protect our future
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, like, like getting rid of
lead, lead, lead paint and lead gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but this is not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's really where,
if we don't have a historical context,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we don't have knowledge of our
traditions, and we don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation and reverence for the right
to access and be part connected to nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna, we were gonna just kind of
give that up entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's really, you know,
I think that's, that's where I'm one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the struggles that I'm very passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate you're asking me and it's
not, you know, cannabis is one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm also, there's a whole family of
psychoactive biota, you know, entheogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural psilocybin mushrooms, and like
ergot fungus that has a lysergic acid in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, we mentioned peyote,
which has mescaline in it, ayahuasca,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, is a has DMT in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all substances that all
these natural plants have chemicals in
[SPEAKER_01]: them that are like our brains
neurotransmitters, they're you can call
[SPEAKER_01]: them neurotransmitter analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, nature has provided
these amazing substances that that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, fit like locks and keys in our
in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's no surprise, because we're all
evolutionarily connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's just kind of a I think
we're we're having a price a crisis of
[SPEAKER_01]: connection to the world and to our own
connection to the natural world and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sense that the government is has
passed laws that have tried to break that
[SPEAKER_01]: connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're, we're trying to
get back on, on footing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for as a doctor, I can't,
I think, without these kind of without
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing this problem, we're never going
to be we're never really going to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: a public health about a modicum of public
health that we we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so well put.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunil, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me see, I got a couple things to
thank you for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, thank you for sharing your
incredibly valuable time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for sharing your experience
and also, you know, just thank you on
[SPEAKER_00]: behalf of all of the patients that you
bring your integrative approach to for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being willing to think outside
the box and to be able to open,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, open your heart and experience
to with the goal of decreasing suffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's it's always a pleasure to
interact with you because interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: a doctor who is is truly dedicated to
helping the patient instead of checking
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes, it always feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so thank you for sharing everything
that you have Sunil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're most welcome.
