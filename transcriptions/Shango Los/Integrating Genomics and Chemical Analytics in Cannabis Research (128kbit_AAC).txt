[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I want to say thanks to everybody for
coming and thank you to Josh for putting
[SPEAKER_13]: on the event and inviting Steco to be a
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is going to be a data heavy talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me apologize in front.
[SPEAKER_13]: So for those of you who came thinking that
I was going to talk about patents,
[SPEAKER_13]: because that's what I do with my other
life.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't keep the same talk twice in a row.
[SPEAKER_13]: I gave the pat talk last time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm supposed to give the pat talk next
time.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you guys need to sit and do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to touch on something that Scott
said as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of us may have a personal campus
story.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that personal campus story is very
important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is kind of what drives,
I think, most of the people in campus in
[SPEAKER_13]: this room.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are trying to make this be a medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: So many of us probably have some
recreational experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reality is that this has been a
medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you go back thousands of years,
you look at ancient Chinese texts,
[SPEAKER_13]: you look at Middle Eastern texts.
[SPEAKER_13]: People have been using this and have known
what it is for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a recent arrogance in the human
population that has chosen to ignore what
[SPEAKER_13]: we've already known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of this, we are way behind
where almost every other commercial crop
[SPEAKER_13]: would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: So my background is actually in plant
biology and genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I got sidetracked with the patent
world and ended up getting back into
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis or research into the cannabis
industry, because the universe put this
[SPEAKER_13]: patent in front of me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so my talk today, in part,
is because in this great thing that we put
[SPEAKER_13]: out for this conference, there's an
interview with three cannabis gurus.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of them said that it would be
great if we had an omens approach.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, wow, we have an omens
approach.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me talk about my omens approach.
[SPEAKER_13]: So before we get started, I want to talk
about the people who make me able to do
[SPEAKER_13]: all of this here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have a great team in Stiegel.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have, again, we're another small
startup.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have limited hands, but the people that
came to work for me are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they come in on the day off,
and they come in on holidays, and they
[SPEAKER_13]: come in when they don't have to,
just because they want to get this done.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I want to say thank you to Anthony
Torres, Christian Cizek, Alex Vo,
[SPEAKER_13]: and Robert Givens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the people from Stiegel Labs.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also wanted to say thank you to Noen
Kinn and Daniel Evergar, who was supposed
[SPEAKER_13]: to be here talking as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: But she conducted the ultimate genetic
experiment, and she's delivering a baby at
[SPEAKER_13]: the time now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So and we partnered with the King Lab and
the Canvas Human Research Initiative.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the data that we're talking about is
kind of an amalgam of our research that we
[SPEAKER_13]: did in-house and also in collaboration
with them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a little bit earlier this year,
I gave a talk called The Real
[SPEAKER_13]: Cannabinovics.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this is going to be Cannabinovics
part two.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I started the last talk about
cannabinovics with a lament about the fact
[SPEAKER_13]: that some economists who have no idea
about the cannabis industry stole the word
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinovics from scientists.
[SPEAKER_13]: So cannabinovics, or omics in general,
is a study of systems or system outcomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we should talk a little bit about
genomics.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
genomics.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also transcriptomics, which is the
study of those things that are transcribed
[SPEAKER_13]: are RNA-based nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_13]: Metabolomics, and that's when you look at
the outcome of those systems that are
[SPEAKER_13]: involved in metabolism and basic life
functions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Proteomics are the more specialized
version of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the proteins, the enzymes,
those are the things that do the work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have chemometrics,
and we should touch on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what the chemical profiles are.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you do your analytic analysis,
you grind with your plant, you in your
[SPEAKER_13]: solvent, and you run it on HPLC,
you're doing the beginnings of a
[SPEAKER_13]: chemometric analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So omics is all those things, but it's
more, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's also about the integration of that
data and understanding what that data
[SPEAKER_13]: integrated together through the different
systems tells you about that plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what we've done is taken,
let me take this back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Steep Hill started in 2008,
we were the first actual, we started the
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis analyst industry, so we were the
first lab to do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we, since then, have developed an
extended cannabinoid platform,
[SPEAKER_13]: extended turbine platform, but all of
those things actually are, we're almost
[SPEAKER_13]: fortuitous because it provided us with a
palette to look for things genetically,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we sort of largely don't work as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're gonna be talking about today
is a lot of interesting stuff that we
[SPEAKER_13]: found, that I found recently.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was talking to Alicia before and some of
the people, I went through this data as I
[SPEAKER_13]: was preparing to talk, and I was like,
wow, my guys really rock.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had no idea they had done all this work,
so this was actually an education for me
[SPEAKER_13]: as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you think about genomics,
it starts with DNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we talked about that a little bit in
Alicia's talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, what you get is
a long stream of A, G, C, and T.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't tell you anything until you
start integrating other knowledge.
[SPEAKER_13]: So plants in general are, like many
organisms, nature doesn't reinvent the
[SPEAKER_13]: wheel.
[SPEAKER_13]: It uses the same thing over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of the genes that we know from
other commercial crops, we find in
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can get a head start on a lot of our
information gathering by spending a little
[SPEAKER_13]: time in the library and looking at what
genes are important for things like
[SPEAKER_13]: flowering, senescence, oil content,
and carbon fixation, those kind of things
[SPEAKER_13]: that are important to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can start looking for those signals in
other plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's kind of how we started.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did a lot of sequences.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got some sequences from our
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have also been using the packed
biosequencer.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's ironic that the two startups chose
the slow, expensive version.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's because both camps
understood the power of the long-read
[SPEAKER_13]: sequencing and getting through some of the
really difficult sections that are
[SPEAKER_13]: necessary to get through it in plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is kind of what you would see if
you sequenced a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: And right here, this is actually a
combination of some client data and our
[SPEAKER_13]: own packed biosequencing data.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is just for one region of the
TSAG.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you get enough of this stuff,
and then you get to start to put together
[SPEAKER_13]: some relationships.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the relationships early on look
like this, where this was actually a
[SPEAKER_13]: publication that we were part of with the
Cain Group.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this was when we had a little bit
of information.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we got more information,
and it looked like this.
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you can see, it rapidly gets to the
point where you can't even see what's
[SPEAKER_13]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_13]: But luckily for us, Phylos did this.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a static picture, which you
already seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you people have not seen the Phylos
galaxy before, I urge you to look at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very informative.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's a great tool to look at,
as I said, as relationships between
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the relationships between cannabis
don't tell you how those things work.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we still need to look at things
mechanistically, and we still need to look
[SPEAKER_13]: and understand what the energy enzymes are
doing and what the nucleotide changes mean
[SPEAKER_13]: in those things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of where we've taken off,
and we've gone to genome-wide association.
[SPEAKER_13]: So genome-wide association, real briefly,
for those of you who are trying to keep
[SPEAKER_13]: this science light.
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically, you take known traits,
and you associate them with you do kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: meta-analysis between nucleotide sequences
and known traits, and you see where the
[SPEAKER_13]: patterns fall out together.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the easiest way to say it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And by doing that, you can identify single
nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs,
[SPEAKER_13]: the places that are responsible for
genetic variance.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can start to see whether or not
any of those SNPs actually hit a trait.
[SPEAKER_13]: And once you have that association,
you can follow that and use that as a
[SPEAKER_13]: molecular marker.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can actually use that as a greedy
tool.
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are the methods of analysis that
we use typically in our genome-wide
[SPEAKER_13]: association studies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's try that again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chemical analyte profiling, gene scanning
analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the majority of the plot today.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then sequencing is how I think we all
start this project.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to start somewhere, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are a couple of good drafts out
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to ask me to what Alicia said
is that remember the human genome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It started 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a publication four days ago that
said that they had just done over 10,500
[SPEAKER_13]: individual humans.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it took about 9,000 individual humans
to actually get to the plateau that we're
[SPEAKER_13]: at where we have 150 million variants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are 150 million variant positions
in three billion bases, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a little under 10%.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that just gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: So through our work with the University of
Colorado Boulder, we already know,
[SPEAKER_13]: we've already found over 10 million
variants in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't have anywhere of the breadth
of cultivar sequencing done in cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: than we do as we have done in humans.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can just imagine that number is
going to skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the extended cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just showed this because this is
really the bread and butter, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are the traits that we're looking
at, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody wants to know about CBG,
TACA, CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we have CDC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we, right now, have identified over 23
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are only 12 standards, but we
actually have tests for 23 in-house now
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're getting ready to offer to our
clientele.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have about 45 terpenes that we
look at.
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of you who've made nose detail
know that we put those together as our
[SPEAKER_13]: strain fingerprints, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they'd be known easily and whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but this is the basis from which we
started to build our genomics platform.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so what we then did is we took,
we had thousands of samples that we
[SPEAKER_13]: acquired either by going through
dispensaries or getting a sample from
[SPEAKER_13]: science as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we started making these genomic DNA
sets to do our version of the genomic
[SPEAKER_13]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I don't know if you can see there,
but I can't even see it online.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully you can see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like we have, on some of these panels,
we have ACDC, easier to say.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we built panels to be able to look at
specific functions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we have a CBD panel, we have a TAC
panel, we have a THCB panel.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have other panels that we're building.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those panels, the reason why we put
those strains together is because it gives
[SPEAKER_13]: us either a spectrum or it gives us the
end points along a spectrum that we can
[SPEAKER_13]: start to look at genetically.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and again, we have, and so to kind
of give a little background, this slide is
[SPEAKER_13]: mainly high CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can actually look and you can see
kind of in the middle, you can see points
[SPEAKER_13]: of difference where it goes from red to
green and there's a couple of red dots and
[SPEAKER_13]: then a few lines over from that,
it starts blue, goes green.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple of ends in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are the pieces of information
that we look at, that we try to make to
[SPEAKER_13]: something that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to jump forward a couple.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, let me jump back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this one is actually the client data
that we did with the mission.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you'll see the two middle lines,
one of them is called one IYP,
[SPEAKER_13]: one of them is called one IYS,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: On the next slide, the two blue arrows
represent the chemical profile that we did
[SPEAKER_13]: for those things that we sequenced,
okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we, and you can see that both of those
turned out to be a low CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means it has most likely an active
drug type THC synthase and either a hemp
[SPEAKER_13]: type or drug type CBD synthase.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's why it's only got a two to one
ratio of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: You see the ones along the top there and
of course, you could have bad luck and
[SPEAKER_13]: none of the sequences that I pulled out
for this slide are any of those guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can see that, but through the
test, we can identify from, and by the
[SPEAKER_13]: way, all that data is actually from a
single mating, a single breeding
[SPEAKER_13]: experiment from that grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he was, he bred a high CBD with a
high THC and was looking for specific
[SPEAKER_13]: traits that came from the mom,
but still stayed high CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we were, so we took the top seven and
that was what he got.
[SPEAKER_13]: He went on with breeding.
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things that we do with all
of this data is we now already have a more
[SPEAKER_13]: persistent breeding program.
[SPEAKER_13]: We started with CBD first.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a number of clients that are
actually turning overseas basically every
[SPEAKER_13]: three months now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now that we have the ability to follow
a trait, you don't have to get the flower
[SPEAKER_13]: anymore to get your answer, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: As soon as you crack a seed, we can tell
you within a couple of days, hey,
[SPEAKER_13]: that one has high CBD, that one does not,
toss the rest, keep that one, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we have clients that are turning
overseas every 35 days, sorry,
[SPEAKER_13]: every three months of turning over the
seed, but every 10 days after cracking
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds, they already have an answer for
their next generation, okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: So one particular grower started with us
about nine months ago and he just cracked
[SPEAKER_13]: his third set of seeds, right,
so in nine months.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means that now you don't have to
wait years for generations, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So the way commercial agriculture works is
you do all your force breeding,
[SPEAKER_13]: short generation times, and then when you
have your final product, then you put that
[SPEAKER_13]: in the field and you grow it to fruition,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You grow things along the way to test them
to make sure you're on the right track,
[SPEAKER_13]: but you don't need the final product
anymore to be able to get where you want
[SPEAKER_13]: to go using modern genome tools.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can skip that one, that's just more
data.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is just to show that in our
profile we're able to identify specific
[SPEAKER_13]: seed to TNC ratios and those ratios,
many of them actually lead to a specific
[SPEAKER_13]: genomic content.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so in designing our, the next
section is, I'll say this is our method of
[SPEAKER_13]: gene scanning.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in designing our methodology,
we want to ask specific questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So are the markers that we have
informative, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can have a marker and it doesn't
tell you anything different or you can't
[SPEAKER_13]: make a conclusion from it, it's not going
to be informative markers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are the primers specific?
[SPEAKER_13]: So are we getting just the part that we
look for or are we picking up other
[SPEAKER_13]: things?
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes you want them to pick up
other things, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of the things that we talked about,
there are multiple copies of TNC-A
[SPEAKER_13]: synthase in cannabis, but not only are
there multiple copies that we know as
[SPEAKER_13]: homologs, there are, in a homolog it means
it's either on the same chromosome or on
[SPEAKER_13]: the same sequence, have the same function,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are other similar sequences
called parallels that may be on a
[SPEAKER_13]: different chromosome, they might have a
different function, but they have a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: the same sequence.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in some of those cases,
you're going to have either functional or
[SPEAKER_13]: non-functional TNC synthase genes that are
somewhere else and you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_13]: find those.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in some cases you want primers that do
pick up more than one thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's one of the questions we asked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are the replicates consistent and can we
get the same data when we do the same
[SPEAKER_13]: experiment at different times across
different plates?
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we look at the final results,
do the groupings that come out of our
[SPEAKER_13]: marker analysis make sense with the
chemical data that we already have?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the final arbiter of whether or not
we're onto something or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is kind of a preview of what we
do.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is one of our gene scanning
analysis that we did.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a segment in the TNC-A synthase team.
[SPEAKER_13]: So part of what we do is we take a gene,
we break it up into multiple segments,
[SPEAKER_13]: we've broken up the TNC segment the gene
to I think eight to 10 segments,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we do a clustered marker analysis for
those segments.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can take it and give me the graph that
we did before.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to go over real quickly these
three blocks, that we have for these three
[SPEAKER_13]: blocks, just to show you how the process
works.
[SPEAKER_13]: So block number one, when you do our
scanning analysis, you get three groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now these groups are picked out by machine
learning algorithms.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is not subjective.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not saying, oh, that looks like
this, that looks like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is all done based on parameters that
include the sequence and specific reaction
[SPEAKER_13]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And based on those, our machine learning
algorithm picks out these clusters and it
[SPEAKER_13]: picks them out correctly over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many of what you're looking at here
at these lines are actually duplicates of
[SPEAKER_13]: the same sample, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So any two that follow on top of each
other are most likely the same exact
[SPEAKER_13]: sample that we run in duplicate to make
sure that they come out correctly.
[SPEAKER_13]: So from that we get, this might be a
little hard to see, we get the ability to
[SPEAKER_13]: now map our chemical profiling to the
groups that were picked out by the other
[SPEAKER_13]: machines, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that helps us identify whether or not
the groupings that are picked out show any
[SPEAKER_13]: chemical difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can clearly see here that the
three groups that were picked out,
[SPEAKER_13]: when you look at the average THC,
and we're looking at THC, here's a real
[SPEAKER_13]: look at the THC data.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at the average THC percentage
of the flower that we get from that,
[SPEAKER_13]: you'll see that the three groupings did in
fact pick out three different populations
[SPEAKER_13]: of chemical profiles, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you do the further analysis,
you can actually look at the nucleotide
[SPEAKER_13]: change and whether or not that nucleotide
change made actually a difference in the
amino acid, right?
So clearly here we have a grouping that is
not related to this change because a
[SPEAKER_13]: change is silent.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you go from isoleucine to isoleucine,
then you have a change in amino acid.
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though we have a nucleotide
difference, right, the enzyme doesn't
[SPEAKER_13]: change.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to me, I would end up tossing this
because this is really not an informative
[SPEAKER_13]: marker, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is an example of us saying,
okay, it tells us for grouping,
[SPEAKER_13]: but it doesn't tell us anything about
whether or not that particular nucleotide
[SPEAKER_13]: was responsible for that change,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can see, you can get different
information.
[SPEAKER_13]: One is a grouping information and one is
whether it's mechanistically important.
So we're going to the next one,
and this one will pick out two groups.
And again, the chemical profiles match
those groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, what I would like to show you is that
in the process of this, if you take a
[SPEAKER_13]: close look at the top of the blue,
this is UH4, those baron-durbin-poisoned
[SPEAKER_13]: UH7, you go to the next block,
and you'll see that those ones at the top
[SPEAKER_13]: are the same, but now one that I didn't
mention, J53I, changes position,
[SPEAKER_13]: it changed from the blue group to the
orange group.
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, two different sets of
information.
[SPEAKER_13]: One's a grouping, and the grouping is
based on the nucleotide sequence.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another one is does that work?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sequence had an effect on the final
outcome.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our method gives us a lot of information
that gives us a number of bites of the
[SPEAKER_13]: apple.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now, this is the third block that I
showed you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So now in this particular block,
as you saw, there was a lot of change in
[SPEAKER_13]: that area.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, we end up with seven
distinct groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the important thing here is that we
see a lot of familial and lineage grouping
[SPEAKER_13]: now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the data that comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You look at the chemical profiles on the
left there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so now you see that there's a green
block by itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: That green block, if we had gone through
the data more closely, you would see that
[SPEAKER_13]: those four strains have been traveling
together through all the blocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's nothing distinguishes those
strains from one another.
[SPEAKER_13]: At least in that region, in the KCA space,
those are most likely very closely
[SPEAKER_13]: related.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you look at the names, Lemon Widow,
Super Goji Oji Haze, Florida Juicy Fruit,
[SPEAKER_13]: they don't really sound like they're
really related.
[SPEAKER_13]: But from this analysis, they have,
that same signature in those three blocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: The other interesting group that falls out
is the purple group.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that surprised me.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it really is, to the point where I was
like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that particular group is representative
of a very new and very exciting
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabinoid, THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's all the rage about THCV.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, everybody's been looking for,
well, what makes, why do we have THCV?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we know we have a different starting
chemical that goes in to make CBGVA.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not a lipatolic acid, it's
divironolic acid.
[SPEAKER_13]: But why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_13]: And how does THCAsynthase handle that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's a shorter core chain,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So does it fit in the pocket the same way?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in this particular group,
those three purple strains all fall out.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are high THCV producing strains,
okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, if there's a gray group that
wasn't there before, and that's J53J.
[SPEAKER_13]: So J53J, I, and D are siblings.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, using this methodology,
we can actually now distinguish siblings
[SPEAKER_13]: from a single cross, okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: We got lucky being with D and G.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would never have thought that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we would need a larger family.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're looking at me like, holy crap,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I said, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So stuff like that doesn't normally happen
unless you're really lucky.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or God's looking out for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we're really lucky and God's
looking out for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we have here is now a third thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the ability to validate.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the ability to determine whether
or not it's actually mechanically
[SPEAKER_13]: important.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we have a classification system
all fallen out of this kind of data,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But because I'm a scientist, and I was
like, well, I got lucky, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do I prove that that happened?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we put together a THCB-specific panel,
and that data is shown here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the THCB-specific panel is now in red,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you see the UH4, the DV, and the UH7,
okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we call it the breeder of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are all familiar.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's another thing, and that is the
Bayonet geneticist.
[SPEAKER_13]: So sometimes you'll find something really
good, and it'll only be a family marker.
[SPEAKER_13]: Only the things in that family have it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was what we were trying to make
sure here.
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't a familial marker.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I asked him to send me more stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anything with DV is from that same
breeder.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I went out and I looked for other
things, like Durbin poison, which is known
[SPEAKER_13]: to have THCB and black beauty,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So the problem with Durbin poison in the
United States is that Durbin poison in the
[SPEAKER_13]: United States is really hit and miss,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we measure a lot of Durbin poison
chemically, and very little of it actually
[SPEAKER_13]: tests like real Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_13]: Durbin poison, if it's real Durbin poison,
we'll have anywhere between one and 2%
[SPEAKER_13]: THCB.
[SPEAKER_13]: The stuff we get in the United States is
.5%, .80%.
[SPEAKER_13]: So chances are it was that super silver
haze crossed the Durbin poison line that
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody has been selling us Durbin
poison, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we include Durbin poison in the United
States, and we actually have a sample from
[SPEAKER_13]: South Africa coming in that we'll run
through this when we get it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But to make a long story short,
all the red were the ones that came up in
[SPEAKER_13]: the previous slide as THCB.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you look right below it,
the two gray lines are black beauty.
[SPEAKER_13]: So black beauty, which also makes THCB,
seems to use a similar mechanism.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that mechanism is shown by the similar
sequence characteristics that we see in
[SPEAKER_13]: this spectrograph, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it looks like we do really have at
least for some THCB strains, a marker that
[SPEAKER_13]: we can follow for reading, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we know that that's going to be
hopefully very popular in the industry
[SPEAKER_13]: because THCB is the hot ticket,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's good for Parkinson's, weight loss,
diabetes, a few other things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So everybody's GW has already got a patent
on it, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it must be good.
[SPEAKER_13]: But now, if you look in the blue section,
so we included some things that we know
[SPEAKER_13]: are not THCB producers because that's
important to have in the control to be
[SPEAKER_13]: able to say, OK, this is what you look
like if you don't do what we're looking
[SPEAKER_13]: for.
[SPEAKER_13]: And lo and behold, dirt and poison from
the United States falls in that group of
[SPEAKER_13]: non-THCB producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: It means that either there are other
mechanisms that we don't know about,
[SPEAKER_13]: and that's perfectly reasonable.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's interesting that some unrelated
strain black beauty falls into the same
[SPEAKER_13]: grouping that you would see with other
THCB producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So for those of you that don't know,
Doe's Varan is the highest-growing
[SPEAKER_13]: producing strain in the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: We helped discover it a few years back in
2012.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a local breeder who actually is a
sweet old man who was growing stuff for
[SPEAKER_13]: his dying wife.
[SPEAKER_13]: She had cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was breeding some stuff back into
hemp because he wanted to make CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing grows like crap.
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes forever to flower, but it's got a
one-to-one ratio of THCB to THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: The only plant in the world that's known
that has that ratio right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we used that as our benchmark,
knowing full well that it may or may not
[SPEAKER_13]: be representative of other THCB producing
strains, which is why we did these
[SPEAKER_13]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_13]: So clearly, some work the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I get my hands on dirt and poison,
we'll see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dirt and poison falls into that same group
that we now have a test for.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really don't have dirt and poison in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm pretty excited about that as well
because I would love to be able to
[SPEAKER_13]: spearhead an effort where people really
name stuff the way it's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_13]: named and not just throw names at it
because then they can move off the
[SPEAKER_13]: shelves, which is something that we have
to have stopped in this industry if we
[SPEAKER_13]: hope to have any chance of being
considered a medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the last thing that is part of this
analysis is then putting all that down
[SPEAKER_13]: together and getting all the groupings.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so here, we were just talking about
one gene.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we do have a CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have now APT, which is the aromatic
primal transferase, otherwise known as
[SPEAKER_13]: CBDA synthase.
[SPEAKER_13]: We use that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: GPP, we've got a whole bunch of genes that
we look at.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ones in black on this slide are the
ones that we already had working or about
to offer.
Are you telling me that I'm done?
No?
OK.
How much time do I have?
OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ones that are not in bold.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we started this whole program with a
gender test.
[SPEAKER_13]: So two years ago, we introduced our male
discriminator, which is, again,
[SPEAKER_13]: based on a Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we built on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same workflow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the ones that we're very interested
in right now are the tricone, clostrin,
[SPEAKER_13]: flowering genes, senescence genes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because people want to start playing with
things like early flowering, late
[SPEAKER_13]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a flower that's sticking
around longer, chances are it will produce
[SPEAKER_13]: more TACA, or whatever it is, as long as
senescence doesn't kick in.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want early flowering, late
senescence.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're looking at a lot of these genes
to see whether or not we can find the same
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of scanning differences through the
segments that we can create for all of
[SPEAKER_13]: these genes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as I said, when you put all of that
data together, we've already had the
[SPEAKER_13]: ability to start distinguishing between
genes.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're hoping that when we get to the
bottom of that list with all those genes,
[SPEAKER_13]: we will have in our midst a strain
identification program.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it
looks like it's flowing out that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm very pleased that we've already
been able to see what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, we've been trying to
figure out how to start offering these
[SPEAKER_13]: services on a larger scale, on a larger
platform.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we started putting together a
sequencing-based program with University
[SPEAKER_13]: of Colorado and the Cancun Research
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are also adding to that the
advanced kind of form of what I was just
[SPEAKER_13]: talking about with all of our markers as
we develop them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we partner with a company called DNA
AgriLock.
[SPEAKER_13]: They make a functionalized paper that
actually allows storage of DNA and nucleic
[SPEAKER_13]: acid at room temperature for decades.
[SPEAKER_13]: So because of that, we want to announce
that we're going to start a strain
[SPEAKER_13]: archiving program where we can actually
start sending your DNA.
[SPEAKER_13]: We will take an initial allopod of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do some initial testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That card is good for 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can go back and look at your
initial stock, see what kind of genetic
[SPEAKER_13]: drift I'm at, or see whether or not when
some hot thing comes out 10 years from
[SPEAKER_13]: now, hey, does my strain already have
that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you'll have that DNA locked in
somewhere in our vaults.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking to put in time stamping and
registration and all of that stuff so that
[SPEAKER_13]: we can actually make it a real
registration program.
[SPEAKER_13]: And because I have a minute and a half
left, and because I was supposed to talk
[SPEAKER_13]: about patents, I just want to say I talked
to Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mowgli and I used to have this banter
going back and forth where we were at
[SPEAKER_13]: opposite ends of what actually was the
same playing field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So after talking, we realized that we
weren't really at the opposite ends.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were just saying things a different
way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So anything on the market right now can be
patented.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a little patent law work.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what cannabis breeders really need to
be doing is using that stuff that we have
[SPEAKER_13]: already out there and breeding their asses
off to make really good strains in the
[SPEAKER_13]: future, and then using programs like this
to get those things to market faster,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then use that information to protect
themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know people don't like this word,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reality is that there's nothing
that we can do to stop a big ad coming in.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would like to see the people who put
all of our work, the people who went to
[SPEAKER_13]: jail, the people who have been breeding
underground for years and years and years,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see them make something with
their lives and not just be left on the
[SPEAKER_13]: wayside.
[SPEAKER_13]: So patents offer that ability.
[SPEAKER_13]: And not by getting greedy and trying to
clean the entire cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_13]: but by working hard, getting a unique
strain that has a useful purpose for some
[SPEAKER_13]: malady or whatever, stabilizing it,
which is important because, as Alicia
[SPEAKER_13]: said, that nobody does any stabilization
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And stabilizing that so that it's true
breeding, and then you turn that into some
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of protection for yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the intelligent, and that's the
everybody has a spot at the table way to
[SPEAKER_13]: move forward patenting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So not the land grab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me keep my neighbor out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's work to make better product so that
we can protect ourselves from the
[SPEAKER_13]: inevitability of what will happen when it
goes scheduled soon.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Reggie and Alicia.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have time.
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually have a half hour scheduled for
questions and discussions if there's
[SPEAKER_14]: something else you want to bring up
relating to genomics.
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have, I believe, at least one mic
runner.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, two mic runners?
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have a question, just kind of
stand up, raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get a microphone over to you.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Sitsa Helsinka.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for the workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've looked at some of the PCA stuff,
but haven't been metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering if you guys have any
genetic correlation between any Vassanifa
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids and endogenomics?
[SPEAKER_14]: How many genomic scientists does it take
to turn on a microphone?
Can you
repeat that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you guys find a correlation between
Sanifa indica and some of the genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what the question comes
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been phenotyping for the phylos
galaxy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's strictly using genetic
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: But things that are typically thought of
as indica or sativa do fall out in various
[SPEAKER_07]: places in the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So our answer to that is, in part,
in agreement with that, a little bit
[SPEAKER_13]: different.
[SPEAKER_13]: So genetically, we know that sativa and
indicas don't necessarily mean anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a geneticist, I 100% concur.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, we have data.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we've been fortunate because we
have done a lot of high times cups and
[SPEAKER_13]: other countless cups.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what happens in those things is
that they come in pre-labeled as indica
[SPEAKER_13]: hybrid or sativa.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it gives us the opportunity to do
random sampling.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have no idea what the strains are.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when I go back through my data sets
and I put together all the things that
[SPEAKER_13]: were hybrid, all the things that were
indica, and all the things that were
[SPEAKER_13]: sativa, and I do a large analysis,
I actually see things fall out as sativa,
[SPEAKER_13]: indica, and hybrid chemically.
[SPEAKER_13]: For instance, linolule.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those things that are indica-like have
more linolule than those things that are
[SPEAKER_13]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_13]: Turpelene.
[SPEAKER_13]: You find a lot more turpelene and sativas
than you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I would not have thought that
without seeing that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because genetically, everything looks the
same.
[SPEAKER_13]: We showed the phylos galaxy.
[SPEAKER_13]: We showed some of the other stuff,
the clad structures.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything comes back to a point at some
point.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I was the first to accept that,
oh, yeah, I don't believe in indica and
[SPEAKER_13]: sativas either.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because genetically, it really doesn't
look like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But chemically, it does.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure what the answer to that
question is.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know that there are differences.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now that I have target populations for
indica, sativas, and hybrids, I can go
[SPEAKER_13]: back and do cluster analysis and see
things that people call indica,
[SPEAKER_13]: fallen indica.
[SPEAKER_13]: Things that people call sativa,
fallen sativa.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know on the genetic side,
there's one answer.
[SPEAKER_13]: On the chemical side, there's another
answer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the right answer is somewhere
in between.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick program of question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's for Josh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will the material that's presented today
be actually available?
[SPEAKER_08]: And if so, where might it be available?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we will make the content
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be partnering with
Greenflower Media to release the content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Max is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, can you stand up?
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll pass out a foreign today.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single person here will get a
massive discount to get all the recordings
[SPEAKER_15]: to watch any time online.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was very interesting to hear
everything you have done about the
[SPEAKER_05]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did see in Alicia's slide,
you had some samples, it looked like,
[SPEAKER_05]: from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious if we have some land races or
some other strains that you may not have
[SPEAKER_05]: in your sample pool yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible to send that to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because international trade in Colombia,
US, all of them is that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even for what you mentioned,
for the DNA agri-lock regime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that sounds interesting to save or
keep safe those strains.
Is that even possible or not?
So the agri-lock is possible because
that's just DNA.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would get the card.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could follow the procedure to get the
DNA on the card, send the card,
[SPEAKER_13]: and everything's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And probably the same thing for pilots.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to send them prepared DNA.
[SPEAKER_13]: DNA is pretty clear of all international
trade restrictions.
[SPEAKER_13]: DNA is just DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question over here on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question for Alicia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to refer back to the slide
where you show the different genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: makeup of the different strains,
like the OG colors, hand and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that the genetic makeup of what
you label as high CBD strain versus hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: is completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the products are being sold as
hemp extract with high CBD content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you conclude that those products are
not being, or whatever is coming from is
[SPEAKER_02]: not actually hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus high CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: And second question is for Reggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the statistical analysis look
like between your groups and the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: chemo types?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we know, what are the controls?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know it's due to the chemo type,
due to just that one group that you
[SPEAKER_02]: showed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it a combination of different
regions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a few locations in the galaxy
that have high CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that I showed you that separates
into a separate population includes ACDC
[SPEAKER_07]: and cannotonic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then closely related to those are some
things that are maybe one to one THC to
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do see that there are other things
that are known to be high CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: In other parts of the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are, in some cases, closer to
hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are probably been multiple times
that we've selected maybe inadvertently
[SPEAKER_07]: purposefully for high CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so while the strains may not be
genetically related over their entire
[SPEAKER_07]: genomes, they have particular activities
of some of these genes that are similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wouldn't discount the fact that you
can get a high CBD strain or cultivar that
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't group with our CBD population.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me add to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we actually see that there are regions
in the relationship data where you'll see
[SPEAKER_13]: a outcropping of high CBD in the middle of
strictly high THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: But they go back to the same point in the
clad, which means that they are related.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means that somebody introduced and
selected for in that spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you could theoretically get high CBD
cannabis or high CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the day, it's still high
CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're extracting it, it's still
CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's really no difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to add that this is an
interesting characteristic of the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a fairly simple trait to select
for controlled by these someplace genes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that may be why we're seeing it pop
up several times.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to answer your second question,
I'm not sure you mean what you mean by the
[SPEAKER_13]: statistical analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So each of those data points represents a
single
[SPEAKER_13]: plant that was sequencing the CBD and THC
synthase genes and then made it to an end.
[SPEAKER_13]: That plant's chemical profile was then
mapped to what we saw.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you do enough of that,
so we have hundreds of those where we
[SPEAKER_13]: have, and one of the alignments I actually
showed it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I had a bunch of our plant samples.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually see where one of the
lines was catatonic, one of the lines was
[SPEAKER_13]: hemp, one of the lines was ACDC.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we use those controls of known
sequence where we know those chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_13]: ACDC is 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it never changes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we do that, and then we map the
client samples to those sequences,
[SPEAKER_13]: and we look and we see they have the same
exact SNP positions that ACDC or
[SPEAKER_13]: Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we map that chemical phenotype,
we have a complete picture.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's really, I guess we could apply
statistic to see, okay, we've done it a
[SPEAKER_13]: thousand times and we got it right in 999.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what statistics you're asking
about there.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the second part of your question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I forgot what the second part
was.
[SPEAKER_13]: The second part of your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I was just curious about the
correlation versus causation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and again, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for the first part of the
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: To clarify what I meant by statistical
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second part of the question was,
how do we know it's not, the different
[SPEAKER_02]: hemotypes is due to that just one specific
group that you showed versus.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that comes from additional alignment.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so when we, so we were just showing
you pieces.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you do the entire gene, you align the
entire gene.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see whether or not those changes
all map.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, one of the things that I showed was
you need to have the changes at the bottom
[SPEAKER_13]: of the blocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was exactly why I said that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And why I said some were informative and
some were informative for groups.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are informative for
mechanistic, mechanistics.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have an isoleucine to an
isoleucine change, it's not a change.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so that, that's not gonna be
responsible for that chemotype change,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But you, when you go through that
analysis, you do find spots where a stop
[SPEAKER_13]: codon was introduced.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that turns off that THC gene,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, or we, one of the things that I
actually talked about was in that third
[SPEAKER_13]: block, there's actually the two of the
changes go from a very polar amino acid to
[SPEAKER_13]: a very non-polar amino acid.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's completely gonna change the binding
pocket, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Ironically, the ones that showed up with
that change were the ones that were the,
[SPEAKER_13]: with the THCV cluster, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so maybe that's a compensatory change
from something else downstream.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: My initial thought was THCV was caused
because of a fatty acyl synthesis.
[SPEAKER_13]: So part of my previous life, I did a lot
of study on fatty acyl synthesis and that
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of metabolic function.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so my first thought was, oh,
it's gotta be fatty acyl synthesis.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how you shorten carbon change.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, so maybe that's still the
case, but there had to be a compensatory
[SPEAKER_13]: change for the THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: To be able to use that shorter chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some things, sometimes you find a marker
in genetics that, that you can use to
[SPEAKER_13]: follow, but it's not necessarily in the
gene.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a trick that we use a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you use whatever you can use to
follow traits.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, but at the end of the day,
we are trying to put together that
[SPEAKER_13]: information.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like we do look, what do you mean by
some changes?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I say, does it make,
does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So isoleucine, no change.
[SPEAKER_13]: Methionine to leucine, again, they're both
non-color.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a big change.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to have a huge change in
the efficacy of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some other things do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's an important consideration too,
because, you know, we all look for that
[SPEAKER_13]: high CBD to THC ratio for that medicinal
aspect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, at some point you hit the maximal
turnover rate of an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is a mechanistic top level,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: You get full throttle, you're full
throttle.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the only way to get a higher CBD
level after that is to make your THC go
[SPEAKER_13]: away, go away.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So now, so some of the stuff that we have
to start looking at is the combinations of
[SPEAKER_13]: things to get to a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's exactly what a phenotype is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So genotype is, you can't see,
and phenotype can be one or more genes in
[SPEAKER_13]: response.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Christian Sweeney from Canada Mystery
Labs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you both.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this question is focused for
Reggie, really.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to mention about my weight
class a little bit, so I hope this makes
[SPEAKER_12]: sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, when you looked at your
data there, how did you prevent,
[SPEAKER_12]: or to what extent did you try to prevent
environmental or growing conditions from
[SPEAKER_12]: impacting, you know, the THC content that
you'd see on the chemometrics side,
[SPEAKER_12]: and make sure you didn't confound that
relationship back to genotypic data?
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an amazing question.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's really no way to do that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because as a analytical lab, we don't even
have the right to go out and pick buds in
[SPEAKER_13]: California.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are, we get what the breeders or the
dispensaries bring us.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can be guaranteed it's going to be
top shelf bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not going to be the crap off the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, there may be a skewing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the one consistent thing is there's
going to be that skewing throughout the
[SPEAKER_13]: entire data set, because everybody's going
to be doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's going to want their best buds
tested.
Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So at least that skewing is consistent.
[SPEAKER_13]: And once it's consistent, you can ignore
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, you still will see
the same trending.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be a little on the high side,
reported on the high side, but the
[SPEAKER_13]: trending will be the same.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we've seen a lot of is that
cannabinoid ratios, which are really
[SPEAKER_13]: important.
Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: The ratios don't change.
[SPEAKER_13]: You may have a higher, max THCA,
but the ratios between those things aren't
[SPEAKER_13]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's not the same as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the ratio between terpenes change
all day long.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where the real problem comes in
with the environmental influence.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So terpenes are going to be a lot harder
to do this way.
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now that our answer is,
well, does it have that gene?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that we're going to actually
have to switch to the next step,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is transcriptomics to be able to
really get a handle on, on how terpene
[SPEAKER_13]: changes are trapped in the organism.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's really, I'm not sure,
if you have a good answer on how to fix
[SPEAKER_13]: that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it is a problem, but it's a
consistent problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, so once it's consistent,
you can kind of try to factor itself out.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you kind of have to assume that these
different growers are growing to the full
[SPEAKER_12]: potential.
[SPEAKER_12]: The genetic potential of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny, you put it that way,
because that's exactly what I said to
[SPEAKER_13]: myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, well, if I was a grower,
am I going to try to go crack the cell?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're all trying to get top dollar.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're all trying to do the best of
their ability.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we take it on fact that that is the
best expression that they were able to get
[SPEAKER_13]: under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that just goes to the best of
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask, I heard Reggie mention
this slightly in his presentation.
[SPEAKER_11]: About oil contents.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there public data, or is there any
information that's already been published
[SPEAKER_11]: and noted in regards to oil contents of
particular strains?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or that might be forthcoming a little bit
later this week.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't work specifically with hemp,
and hemp is what they looked at oil the
[SPEAKER_13]: most in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I don't have an answer to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do know that there are genes,
and they're, again, fatty, acosyl
[SPEAKER_13]: synthases, among other things,
that are responsible for carbon chain
[SPEAKER_13]: production that go into fat and oil
content.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a general study of any of those fatty,
acyl, or oil content genes is going to
[SPEAKER_13]: give you a handle on different reading.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know if anybody's done a full
on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me compare all the hems and see how
much ball I can get out of the same
[SPEAKER_13]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a question about genetic
diversity of the gene pool at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a question for you is that with us
losing more and more of the land races
[SPEAKER_10]: because they're becoming impure,
either because of human destruction of
[SPEAKER_10]: their habitat, or because sea hunters are
going there and trading with local folk
[SPEAKER_10]: with our hybridized seeds, and then they
grow it in their locale, and then now the
[SPEAKER_10]: local land race becomes polluted.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the potential of those land races is
decreasing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, we've got all these
new growers who are feeling freer to do
[SPEAKER_10]: breeding on their own, and they're excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So potentially, we are increasing the
likelihood of genetic mutations that we
[SPEAKER_10]: can see and take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the whole, do you see that the total
available genetic pool is growing because
[SPEAKER_10]: of the increased excitement and
experimentation, or do you actually see it
[SPEAKER_10]: going down because the availability of
original land races is decreasing,
[SPEAKER_10]: and so we need to preserve the hell out of
them right now because we're going on a
[SPEAKER_10]: quick road down.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that just struck me is that some
of the land races that we've sampled,
[SPEAKER_07]: their genetic heritage is not represented
in the modern drug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can get a hold of those and
preserve them in some way as viable seeds
[SPEAKER_07]: or as tissue, I think it's definitely
worthwhile because there's been very
[SPEAKER_07]: little analysis of what those plants
actually produce as far as cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_07]: and terpenes, and we don't really
understand how they grow at different
[SPEAKER_07]: environments either.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they could be a big boon to new
cultivars that we want to produce.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to add to that that the term
land race,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's interesting because the reality is
from her first slide where we showed the
[SPEAKER_13]: migration pattern of units, and it's
probably the most likely the migration
[SPEAKER_13]: pattern of cannabis as well, because it
was the first domesticated plant and we've
[SPEAKER_13]: been traveling with it our entire
existence.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what land races represent are cultivars
that we have inbred or starting to breed
[SPEAKER_13]: because they've provided certain things
and then we've left them behind and
[SPEAKER_13]: they've gone feral.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a wind pollinated plant, so
everywhere we've left something behind,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's been leaving pollen and that pollen's
probably been carried.
[SPEAKER_13]: So land races don't necessarily represent
an inbred or pure population to begin
[SPEAKER_13]: with.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, if we look at things in the more
recent drug breeding or medicinal
[SPEAKER_13]: breeding, to use that word, we probably
could see that land races will have less
[SPEAKER_13]: hybridization to a degree than land races,
but all of that genetic diversity is
[SPEAKER_13]: important and it can also be gained.
[SPEAKER_13]: So every time you take two F1s,
think about it, this is an F1.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do everything by clonal propagation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you take blue dream.
[SPEAKER_13]: Blue dream is probably not stable.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably an F1 or an F2 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that means if you were to self that,
you get a bunch of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you take something else that's an F1
and you self that, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_13]: bunch of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you take those two things and you
put them together, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_13]: bunch of different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So every time we do a non stabilized
breeding, we develop new genetic
[SPEAKER_13]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not worried about genetic diversity
going away in cannabis anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's so much of it there and so much of
our strains are clonally propagated in our
[SPEAKER_13]: F1s to begin with.
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't even started with it until it
tells what bottom I get.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're agreeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would still say that we should try to
get a hold of those malferral
[SPEAKER_07]: but as much as we can try to get a hold of
them because they do represent another
[SPEAKER_07]: element of genetic diversity that is not
seen in the drug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Given that, I agree with you that the
current cultivars do have a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic diversity to work with.
[SPEAKER_13]: But more diversity is always better and
preserving stuff is what's going to make
[SPEAKER_13]: sure that we don't lose anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's the other problem in the
underground breeding and Alicia said it's
[SPEAKER_13]: great.
[SPEAKER_13]: We bred and THC went skyrocketing but
there's also diminishing returns kind of
[SPEAKER_13]: thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's only so much carbon in the
plant and if you start pumping stuff out
[SPEAKER_13]: at 30, 34%, you're going to narrow down
everything else that you can do.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've trained diversity for numbers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's time to go back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question there regarding the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know that there is something like
100 cannabinoids but we know something
[SPEAKER_09]: like three enzymes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think that you're going to find
more enzymes or it's just changing in the
[SPEAKER_09]: enzymes that are already there or in the
degradation process to have all this
[SPEAKER_09]: variety of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys, stop with the hard questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we've been on the extended hunt
for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we right now, we report on 17,
we track internally 23 but we actually
[SPEAKER_13]: have probably 50 to 60 that we actually
see in our chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the four carbons, we have the
three carbons, we have the two carbons,
[SPEAKER_13]: we have the zero carbons.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so a lot of stuff like that,
when you look at carbon chain shortening,
[SPEAKER_13]: the only difference in the molecule is a
shorter carbon chain.
[SPEAKER_13]: It typically happens, it has to happen on
a degradation processing side,
[SPEAKER_13]: alpha, beta, omega oxidation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's typically how plants and
organisms handle fatty acid turnover or
[SPEAKER_13]: chain shortening.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a lot we don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would not be surprised to see more
cannabinoid genes, but you're right,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's only three so far that are
classically cannabinoid gene-like.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that in our sequencing,
we have a pretty good representation,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we don't have 100% coverage.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys have 100%
coverage of the genome.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there may be stuff that we haven't
found yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm always hopeful that there's,
I always want more genes because it allows
[SPEAKER_13]: me to do more stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a good question, and I don't know
what we'll find.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do think a lot of what we see is
classical alpha, beta, or omega fatty acid
[SPEAKER_13]: oxidation is what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, it's really awesome to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question is kind of on the
applied side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're gonna get to a point where I
can throw you a bunch of butts and you
[SPEAKER_00]: say, okay, this is strain A, this is
strain B, this is strain C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering how we will decide
what the cutoff is for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, whether it's the genetics,
whether it's some kind of phenotypic,
[SPEAKER_00]: say the chemo type, whether it's a
combination of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering whether you guys
could comment on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we, another good question.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you think about the tennis industry,
there's the recreational side and then
[SPEAKER_13]: there's the medical side, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have adopted the approach where we
are trying to help develop a chemical and
[SPEAKER_13]: genetic nomenclature, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can follow lineages that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then even lineages, because as anybody
who's grown knows that if you change
[SPEAKER_13]: growing condition in the same mom,
five different growing conditions will
[SPEAKER_13]: give you five different results,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a genetic correlation and
there's a chemical correlation and that
[SPEAKER_13]: chemical correlation can change depending
on the outcome, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So to look like a pharmaceutical industry,
we could actually do that very easily by
[SPEAKER_13]: characterizing genetics under different
growing conditions and then having an
[SPEAKER_13]: amalgam of chemical and genetic
information as our naming convention.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how does that fit to your question?
[SPEAKER_13]: So the cutoffs that you're asking about
are most likely gonna be when we get
[SPEAKER_13]: enough sequencing data, we'll be able to
say, look, a blue dream is this plus or
[SPEAKER_13]: minus this much variation, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: But that kind of thing doesn't come till
we get to the level of sequencing that we
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of have in the human genome where we
have 10,000 different individuals and we
[SPEAKER_13]: can see how much variation in certain
regions, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there are certain regions that are
completely invariant.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have a mutation that you're
probably not viable, then there are other
[SPEAKER_13]: regions where they can't, just doesn't
care.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's plastic, you can do anything you
want, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So somewhere in between there,
is a signature for any given strain that
[SPEAKER_13]: can vary a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in certain regions, they'll be
invariant.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's blue dream, it has to have that,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's just gonna be a matter of time
till we get enough data to be able to do
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm surprised you guys don't really
have much of that to that, so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I think we can also just look to
traditional plants' genetics and use the
[SPEAKER_07]: conventions that are used for any other
kind of agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a genetically stabilized line
that is producing consistent, a certain
[SPEAKER_07]: range of phenotypes, then that is a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made a distinction between clonal
cultivars and parent offspring based on a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of different genetic metrics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is a clone depends on how
accurately you can sequence the genes of
[SPEAKER_07]: your particular samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you have technical limits to your
ability to distinguish the differences
[SPEAKER_07]: between things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You feel pretty confident that we have a
significant number of samples that are
[SPEAKER_07]: actual clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then on the flip side of that,
they're not homozygous.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a lot of variation within them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not what you would consider to
be traditional inbred lines at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that the industry has a long
way to go to developing those lines that
[SPEAKER_07]: will produce consistent phenotypes when
they're solved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's actually the biggest problem
right now for our study.
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now, it's almost impossible to
answer some of these questions because we
[SPEAKER_13]: don't have in every other commercially
important crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have inbred mapping populations.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can do a cross or two crosses.
[SPEAKER_13]: And as long as you have amenable trait,
you can find that gene in one or two
[SPEAKER_13]: crosses because they're that inbred.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would be ideal if we had something
like that in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_13]: We would get so far so fast.
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem is, again, because of the
force underground, everything is F1
[SPEAKER_13]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_13]: And here's the worst part about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: F1 hybrid is hybrid-vigorous.
They work great.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, oh my god, it's the most
amazing phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the biggest bud.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you try to solve it, and it all
goes away.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it takes you forever to find them
again.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's part of the problem of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we might be wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to cut this off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a chance to ask your question.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been waiting very patiently.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try to make it quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Michelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of an industry-wide question.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of us here today participating,
obviously we have a great interest in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and science, and particularly
myself, genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I've seen in asking dispensary
owners and things, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: addressing kind of the free-for-all that
it's been as far as strain aiming,
[SPEAKER_06]: how do we inspire the same kind of
attention that we all have here when it
[SPEAKER_06]: comes to genetic analysis?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we inspire that, leaving this
conference today or after the next couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of days, how do we inspire that throughout
the general industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we encourage people to get their
strains genetically tested?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we encourage that same kind of
curiosity and interest in science and to
[SPEAKER_06]: have this hard science, to have this hard
data, how do we encourage that throughout
[SPEAKER_06]: the general industry?
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this conference is actually a
great place to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did notice that, just reading people's
tags earlier, that there are some
[SPEAKER_14]: dispensary owners here.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some budtenders.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a wide variety of people here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe this is a good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be expanded in the future with
this session.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do have to take a break because
there is coffee scheduled in the exhibit
[SPEAKER_14]: hall.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do want to tell everybody that at 11
o'clock, there's a keynote here.
[SPEAKER_14]: My lab is better than your lab,
I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a keynote address by Word in Progress
of Trace Analytics.
[SPEAKER_14]: So please come back for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And please join me in thanking Alicia and
Reggie for that.
Thank you.
