[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there, Shango and I am down at Indo
Expo in Portland today and I got here a
[SPEAKER_01]: day early to hang out with my friend here
Ben Cassaday from True Turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: True Turpines has been one of the original
sponsors of Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been hearing their commercials on
the show for a long time and so Ben and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got together day for lunch and we were
talking and he's telling me about these
[SPEAKER_01]: new certifications that True Turpines has
gotten as a company and they're the first
[SPEAKER_01]: folks in Turpines in cannabis or maybe at
all to get these and they were so
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting I'm like hold on hold on Ben
we got it we got to do this and record it
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is something that nobody else
is talking about and I think we should as
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry as a whole is trying to
increase quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben nice nice to see you and thanks for
buying lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you is why are these
new three certifications that you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the process of and this first one this
this good manufacturing practices which
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like it's kind of key to the
triangle like teach us about that tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: why that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know GMP good manufacturing practices
really is just a set of principles that
[SPEAKER_00]: are followed across enterprise industries
everywhere from you know iron working to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical device manufacturing to food and
it basically means that you have put
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtful practices into place for
manufacturing starting from the time when
[SPEAKER_00]: you design your facility all the way up to
the next step along the way of sourcing
[SPEAKER_00]: your raw materials and then how you
combine those raw materials into your
[SPEAKER_00]: final product and then deliver that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really it's it's oversight it's
quality control and it's quality assurance
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire entirety of creating a
product and delivering it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers and then even past that it's the
way that you collect the feedback from
[SPEAKER_00]: your consumers it's the way that you
handle your complaints it's the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you educate and train your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it really gives us is a greater
level of control over the entire product
[SPEAKER_00]: process and a greater level of
understanding as far as what are we
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing and from who you know part of
that process is not just purchasing things
[SPEAKER_00]: off of the internet and taking the word of
the supplier that's selling it to you but
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sending a representative from
your company to the supplier to audit
[SPEAKER_00]: their facility based upon a set of
criteria that's been established and
[SPEAKER_00]: approved when you when you received your
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us last week we actually received
our final hard copy of our certification
[SPEAKER_00]: for a GMP 2019 we were really happy with
that we actually almost immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards had a surprise audit got a
96.5% as far as the grading scale goes so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know really happy with that one and
what it really comes down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of GMP is you know for these
multi-state operators people that are that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working at a really large scale or
business operators that are coming in from
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries that are kind of used to
following these parameters it's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise to them that they can't purchase
things in the cannabis world that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from GMP certified manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that people are not GMP certified
in cannabis so these larger companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming with the hopes of making gargantuan
purchases and they're like there's nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do business with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly so for us you know the real focus
and the pressure came from getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to do business with Canada specifically
because of the you know the legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been established in Canada and the
relationship that all of these that all
[SPEAKER_00]: these LPs have with European counterparts
you know Canada isn't just an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell to 35 million people it's an
opportunity to sell to 400 million people
[SPEAKER_00]: because Canada will be exporting to Europe
potentially to Israel potentially to
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia and all and in order for a
product to be manufactured in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to be then sent to one of these
other markets it's going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured under GMP practices and for
something to be manufactured under GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: practices in most cases all of the raw
materials that go into that product must
[SPEAKER_00]: come from a GMP facility as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first started describing it you
said that you know it's it's it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like guidance for very thoughtful
manufacturing right and you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the more professional responsible
companies in cannabis would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: self-describe their processes as
thoughtful right and you gave us a really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice kind of like you know actually pretty
exhaustive list of all the things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to in different categories that have
to be dialed in can you give me two
[SPEAKER_01]: examples in any two categories of you know
what kind of the default setting was and
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you had to drill that down to meet
these requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I think you know the the one that
stood out to me the most is surprising was
[SPEAKER_00]: the the complaints and positive feedback
for the customer service cycle so
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally you know we did a pretty
good job of rectifying complaints and
[SPEAKER_00]: thanking people for their positive
feedback but we didn't actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: methodical way of logging that and then
addressing it like somebody might call and
[SPEAKER_00]: say hey my bottle leaked in transit and
historically we would have said you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very sorry to hear about that you
know let us overnight you a replacement it
[SPEAKER_00]: does that make you happy great case
closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point which sounds like we're
totally reasonable customer service man
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah handled customers happy etc but now
we have this error complaint log the error
[SPEAKER_00]: complaint log is is spoken about specific
quality control meeting once a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: then addressed again monthly as kind of
like a consolidated report and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: thresholds and I don't know all of them
off the top of my head right now but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically let's say that we had a thousand
packages shipped in a month and 50 of them
[SPEAKER_00]: came back with leak complaints that would
trigger a quality chain a change
[SPEAKER_00]: management process to where we have to
look into is it the cap is it the lining
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cap is it what could have went
wrong is it is it the physical labor
[SPEAKER_00]: that's putting the cap on is it the shrink
band like we look at all of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: principles that go into allowing that to
happen and we have to make an action plan
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have to follow up on that
action plan in the following months
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting and compare did the plan work is
there less and so it forces for there to
[SPEAKER_00]: be continual improvement so I'd say that's
the first one just because you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you're doing a great job in
quality assurance but then you're sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: and handling customer complaints and
positive feedback but then you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's actually maybe an iterative
process that you can go through to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: even better and so that's been very
positive for us and then I think probably
[SPEAKER_00]: you know one of the other ones that wasn't
as surprising but was a very major change
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think one of the true advantages now
of doing business with it with us is when
[SPEAKER_00]: we first started going down this road no
longer taking the word of suppliers that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were buying things from and going into
the facilities and actually doing audits
[SPEAKER_00]: and sending our quality director in to
make sure that they were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: upholding and doing the things that they
were making claims on when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling us their products and that's
things like you know claiming that
[SPEAKER_00]: something was stored in cold storage but
it's actually just at room temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and a big one is you know a lot
of people will you know and when we
[SPEAKER_00]: started off we were doing this as well
they'll take the certificate of analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: from the supplier as gospel and never do
any additional internal testing or
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party testing to verify that so
that's one of the first things we changed
[SPEAKER_00]: early on about two years ago well we
started going down this process but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's just one of the most dramatic
things if you're buying from a company and
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on all of their intelligence to
make your decisions that you know people
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all human people make mistakes and
if you're not verifying along along the
[SPEAKER_00]: line it's as simple as receiving a you
know ordering two shipments from a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier in sequence and maybe them
receiving one of them out of order and
[SPEAKER_00]: then tagging something wrong thinking that
it's a different lot of product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: attributing the paperwork to that lot and
then down the down the line all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: different changes can cascade because you
think you have one product but you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have another so it's just you
know it's it's like I said the words get
[SPEAKER_00]: used a lot but it's quality control it's
controlling the situation and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: double checking that and assuring it with
the quality assurance so I think I think
[SPEAKER_00]: those two are probably the two two of the
biggest that we that we've dealt with and
[SPEAKER_01]: learned from right on those good examples
a couple thoughts come to mind one is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all of these additional trips to your
suppliers and hotel rooms and and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: additional employees that you've got to
hire to do this clearly these costs are
[SPEAKER_01]: rising and and if you didn't grow as a
company it would really probably eat into
[SPEAKER_01]: your margins but as a business person it's
an interesting hustle to consider that
[SPEAKER_01]: okay we're gonna we're gonna hire these
new people and we're gonna spend all these
[SPEAKER_01]: new money new we're gonna spend all this
money on qualifications but what it does
[SPEAKER_01]: is open up you know Canada and
international trade and being able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: business with companies like Coca-Cola
right where who demand GMP certification
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly so you know it's interesting as
terpenes develop into more than just being
[SPEAKER_00]: used specifically in cannabis products you
know kind of like adding to a tincture or
[SPEAKER_00]: adding it to a topical or combining with a
vape pen you know we're starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these functional products where that
people are developing we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: five-hour energy type shots that are meant
to manipulate and modify your your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis experience and so we're having a
lot of companies come into the space like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Coca-Cola or big five beverage brewers
and they they want you know they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with us as well but then immediately
almost almost as soon as the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: arrive they they get them they like them
they talk okay now we're gonna move you
[SPEAKER_00]: over to purchasing and we're gonna start
talking about papering this up immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the first thing is where the
certifications we need to know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with and so yeah I mean you hit
the nail on the head it's it what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and continues to be a pretty large
investment of resources to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this but it allows us to give greater
quality assurance to the people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: done business with us from the start and
it allows us to bring in new contracts and
[SPEAKER_00]: new clients from from other worlds where
regulation matters a little bit more but I
[SPEAKER_00]: will say it's not it didn't come to us as
a surprise like we didn't one day go oh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we should go quality like from
the very beginning we intended to build
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpene company that would that would
survive and would be able to do business
[SPEAKER_00]: with regulated cannabis markets we didn't
chase after fast money in the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: we've basically been reinvesting towards
this since early or since late 2016 so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just it's final you know that's the
other thing too is if you if your company
[SPEAKER_00]: started within the last year you're not
GMP like you and that's that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you need to really watch out
for I think you have a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they're operating under GMP
standards but that doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've actually had a third-party audit
and that they actually are doing it it
[SPEAKER_00]: just means that they kind of aspirational
yeah really it's called being in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit of is the technical term and you
know I know growers who are in the spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: of organic so that that's one of the main
things in that we're hoping you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the opportunity to talk about this
because you know the question to ask if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody tells you that they're certified
is can I see your certificate can I see
[SPEAKER_00]: who's who's the third party that audits
you and then you know if you're concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's also within the cannabis
world I hate to have to say it but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of counterfeit going on you
know call the third party if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not 100% satisfied or or convinced
of its authenticity because it's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: their job the third part third party is
gonna ask you for the their certificate
[SPEAKER_00]: number or the name of the business they'll
look you up and they'll tell you exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in the last audit and they
just make it really easy so so you were
[SPEAKER_01]: also mentioning that that now that you are
GMP certified this sets you up for
[SPEAKER_01]: additional certifications that that just
get heavier and heavier what are those
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so the one that follows right after
GMP is is FSP which is just food safety
[SPEAKER_00]: plan basically is very very similar to
having like a GMP operations procedure for
[SPEAKER_00]: basically everything but it pertains to
the fact that our products are meant for
[SPEAKER_00]: human consumption and so it goes above and
beyond what you might need for like
[SPEAKER_00]: medical device manufacturing or something
like that it's just ensuring proper
[SPEAKER_00]: storage of raw materials that are going to
be consumed making sure that you keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life on everything making sure that
you're keeping basically every single lot
[SPEAKER_00]: that we send out into the world has to
then have a sample retained so that if
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody calls and says you know we got
this tested and it was full of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals and pesticides we can pull that lot
out of the refrigerator send it off for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and confirm that in fact it wasn't
our product right so it goes above and
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond to ensure that and a lot of that
stuff I mean I've toured your your
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing facility you already did a
lot of that stuff but I get that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: this is making sure that you've got
numbered and certified paperwork yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: behind your practices exactly it's just so
it stands up in court it's a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and then you know the last
certification the one that we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: probably most excited about and to is is
the ISO 9001 2015 which to get to you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically do all of the requirements of
GMP anyway so most people will go GMP and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go ISO and it's just based it's the
international standards whereas GMP as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're practicing it from my understanding
is just like United States based and
[SPEAKER_00]: focused primarily however like I had
mentioned I know that several European
[SPEAKER_00]: nations major ones like Germany and the UK
and whatnot operate off of those same
[SPEAKER_00]: standards ISO is the international
standards and so what that basically it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes above and beyond for documentation
and vetting of the suppliers and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to I'd have to really default to
our quality director to point out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact specifics that make it different but
it's it's above and beyond it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more rigorous and it's internationally
recognized which really will just give us
[SPEAKER_00]: again that foothold to be able to go and
work with multi-state and multi-country
[SPEAKER_00]: operators within cannabis and then other
organizations from the traditional world
[SPEAKER_01]: right on you know kind of to wrap up I
know that you know you go back way back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the medical days like I do right and
and you know it's kind of funny because
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know I I still yearn for the
medical days and the freedoms that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: and and the quality of products that we
had and yet you know when when when
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory structure started to come out I
was a fan of everybody having to get
[SPEAKER_01]: product testing right because a lot of
stuff went through medical without proper
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers without it going to a lab or
anything so you know they're even though I
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I miss medical you know the
increased of quality so that patients can
[SPEAKER_01]: get what they're expecting to get right
this is like all the way at the other end
[SPEAKER_01]: of that right this is this is this is not
people prepping products and kitchens or
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this is this is regulatory kind
of at us they had a steroid level and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess that's what's necessary to for you
to make a jump as a company from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know having started small becoming
national pretty quick but then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world market is there and and
everybody's gonna have to start stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: up because you know we talk a lot on this
show about how you know some folks are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna stay local and then when interstate
transport becomes allowed a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: local companies if they have not developed
specialty products and strains and got
[SPEAKER_01]: their margins where they need them to be
they're all just gonna disappear have
[SPEAKER_01]: regionals pop up and and then yeah so if
you are a product manufacturer and this
[SPEAKER_01]: these these these ideas of GMP and ISO are
new to you you might want to look into it
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're looking to expand
quickly because it takes a while to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff and to develop the procedures
and work with them so that as the market
[SPEAKER_00]: expands you can be there and ready to go
you know and I think depending on it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really matter which direction you
plan on going if you plan on operating
[SPEAKER_00]: your organization for the next 30 years
and you have no plan of parting from it
[SPEAKER_00]: following the path of getting these
certifications is only going to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: stay compliant with regulations as they as
they develop whether that means you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in Canada and they're reducing
regulation or you're in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're trying to you know put the
toothpaste back into the tube with us and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the other end of the spectrum if
you're trying to sell your company or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to you know whatever flavor
of that having these certifications makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's very enticing to investors or or
to new business partners or whoever to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have written SOPs and methods for
everything across your business and again
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that thoughtfulness it's that you you
took a view from 30,000 feet down and
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at how should the business run and
then you planned it that way and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's really you know the audit that
that's really the main difference is you
[SPEAKER_00]: by ourselves you know we were we were
operating very much in this way but having
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else come in from the outside and
say you know you say you do it this way
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm watching the way that you open the
caps and pour those bottles and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you had it written so let's
adjust that either we need to change
[SPEAKER_00]: what's written or we need to change the
action but let's make sure that it matches
[SPEAKER_01]: it's for all of the things that about
regulatory cannabis that frustrates me
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the positive promise that people
been talking about so yeah awesome cool
[SPEAKER_01]: well thank you for sharing the story and
breaking us all in it's always pleasure to
[SPEAKER_01]: see you right on Portland right on you you
you you you you you you
