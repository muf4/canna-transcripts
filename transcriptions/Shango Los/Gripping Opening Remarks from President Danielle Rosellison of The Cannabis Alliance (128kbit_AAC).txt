[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before I tell you who I am and
what I do, I want to tell you why we do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was, I'm sorry, when my dad was
18 years old, he was the first person in
[SPEAKER_00]: his family to go to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took a quarter off of college in
order to, you gotta get some extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took a quarter off of college in order
to pay for it, because he couldn't afford
[SPEAKER_00]: it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that quarter, he got drafted for
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back to Vietnam to totally change
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fast forward 30 years, I was 22
when I figured out that that room in the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement with the lights and the plants in
it, what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, he was not growing
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 years later, the day before Veterans
Day in 2014, we had just taken down our
[SPEAKER_00]: first legal harvest of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad became one of the 22 veterans
that commit suicide every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you wonder and when you ask why I
do what I do and where I get the energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise small children and run a business
and be the president of the Campbell's
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance, I do this every day for my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this every day for the veterans who
can't get access to medicine that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: works for them and can help make their
lives better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this for the mothers and the fathers
whose children are suffering with terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: legal diseases or whose grandparents are
suffering and they can't get access and we
[SPEAKER_00]: know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do this for the wives and the
mothers and the daughters whose husbands
[SPEAKER_00]: and brothers and fathers are sitting in
jail for selling a plant to people who
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to raise our consciousness and
to stop this insanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the heavy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Danielle Rosellison and I am
serving my second term as a democratically
[SPEAKER_00]: elected president for the Campbell's
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys keep voting in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to think it's because of my
surreal optimism and charming good looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's much, much deeper than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if I had to guess,
it's because of my comprehension of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as a business owner and I've been
part of this industry since long before it
[SPEAKER_00]: was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's my vision of how we
collectively want humanity to evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's my empathy for all
parties involved, willing and unwilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The no-pick nimmies and their feelings are
just as important as ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good listeners or good leaders,
we listen to all sides of the coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We empower people to work on issues that
are important to them and to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple perspectives to the table so that
we can find common ground and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that works for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any policy makers or regulators in this
room know that there are a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions inside the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would make your guys' jobs a whole
lot easier if we could all come to
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement and find common ground before we
showed up in your doorstep to make phone
[SPEAKER_00]: calls and emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what the cannabis
alliance does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis alliance is made up of
producers, processors, retailers,
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, and transport companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also made up of other associations,
patients, hemp enthusiasts, ancillary
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, 502 employees, consumers,
a few haters here and there that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: here to troll us, and veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We at the cannabis alliance are advocating
for the betterment of everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: a socially conscious industry that cares
about employee wages, that cares about our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, patient access to affordable
healthcare, the environment, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: our bottom lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a really silly business person and
my marketing expert would kill me if I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't mention that I also own Trailblazer
Productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a licensed tier two producer
processor in Bellingham, Washington that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces pesticide-free, medical-grade,
award-winning cannabis using 100% LED
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and water reclamation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of what that means,
we use 50% less power consumption than
[SPEAKER_00]: normal indoor grows that use HPS,
which is approximately enough to power 150
[SPEAKER_00]: homes per year in our current situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went from using 500 gallons of
water a day to 40 with the invention my
[SPEAKER_00]: husband came up with one day, the water
reclamation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't make these choices to save
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why you put LEDs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made these choices because it's the
right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is for the greater good, and those
morals and values that drive our decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: and our business practices at Trailblazer
are exactly the same morals and values
[SPEAKER_00]: that I bring to the cannabis alliance and
that our board members share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an honor and a privilege to
volunteer with the cannabis alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta be honest with you guys,
I have no interest in starting an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every business is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every association is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every regulatory procedure is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's total chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean total chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the journey forward is really
daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people who make up the members of
the cannabis alliance find time away from
[SPEAKER_00]: their startup companies and their family
obligations to invest in the greater good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a vision of where they want the
cannabis industry to go, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: tactics on how to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not know it all right there in
their heads, but they're surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: other people that are also offering ideas
and bouncing them off each other so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can actually get to what we know the
cannabis industry is capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The members of the cannabis industry will
fight for not just what is good for their
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line, but what is fair and good for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a really stellar lead up to our
opening speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna talk about fighting for
what's best for all of us, not just one's
[SPEAKER_00]: personal belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna talk about someone who's
dedicated to what is fair for all humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just those who share his own
non-mutual benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our opening speaker does just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't just talk the talk and feel
that way, but he takes the action to
[SPEAKER_00]: support that stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like our alliance members.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's shown time and time again that he is
committed to protecting our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, something that everybody who
lives in the Pacific Northwest treasures,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably all over the world treasures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's committed to protecting our civil
rights, and he's committed to protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: our state rights, which in this setting
means the right to legal, adult,
[SPEAKER_00]: and medically used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I tell you who our opening speaker
is, in case you didn't know, we have two
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic sponsors that brought him here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three fantastic sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics is in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics and the Normal Women of
Washington are proud to team up as the
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsors for Washington Attorney General
Bob Ferguson's keynote speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics is a Washington based
company, topical manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: established in 1995, focusing on whole
plant extraction and the synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between cannabinoids,
terpenoids, and other botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who doesn't know what a terpenoid
is, find an aw or any licensed person in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics was a staple in both the
hemp retail space going back to the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s, the Washington medical marijuana
space, and they literally kicked the doors
[SPEAKER_00]: open to the mainstream marketplace for
cannabis topicals in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics is a law-changing force in
Washington state defining cannabis health
[SPEAKER_00]: and beauty aids, which is a shabba if you
ever hear that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And removing these types of products out
of the Washington state controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing these products from the
Washington state controlled substance act
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first removal of anything cannabis
out of any state controlled substance act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Basics founder Al Warner is an
active member of the community and is a
[SPEAKER_00]: guiding force for normal women of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob, please stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one we've got is the
Normal Women of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Normal Women of Washington are a
remarkable group of women dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: ending marijuana prohibition and promoting
social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal women are committed to elevating
women's voices in our democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through outreach, education, and
communities, they live the change they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join Normal Women of Washington in
this legislative session in support of
[SPEAKER_00]: home growth, felony expungement,
yes, and employment protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Canova, can you please stand,
and then any other Normal Women of
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, please stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now without further ado, I'd like to
introduce our amazing keynote speaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State Attorney General Bob
Ferguson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Ferguson is a fourth generation
Washingtonian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a champion of civil rights,
a tireless defender of democracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an exemplary public servant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under his leadership in the last year
alone, and just yesterday to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, thanks for having us,
the Washington Attorney General's office
[SPEAKER_00]: has successfully sued President Trump and
has successfully triumphed in significant
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer protection cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the whole world
[SPEAKER_00]: watching, Bob Ferguson consistently stands
up for Washington's legal and moral right
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate cannabis and to take a new
approach to the failed war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, no other attorney general has
done more to challenge and to stand up to
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney General's sessions and his
demonstratively false and flawed position
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you for your courage,
for your commitment, and for your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're proud to have you today in the
Attorney General's office in Every Day
[SPEAKER_00]: Forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to give a warm welcome to
Attorney General Bob Ferguson.
Thank you.
