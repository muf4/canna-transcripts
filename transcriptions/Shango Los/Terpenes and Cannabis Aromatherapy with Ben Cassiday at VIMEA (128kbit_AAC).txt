[SPEAKER_03]: Our guest this evening is my good friend
Ben Cassaday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben is co-founder of True Turpenes in
Portland, Oregon and he was kind enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: drive all the way up just for tonight's
event.
[SPEAKER_03]: True Turpenes provides exceptional quality
organic steam distilled turpenes both solo
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as in handcrafted cannabis
profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight Ben is going to talk to us about
turpenes and improving our health through
[SPEAKER_03]: aromatherapy both with and without
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it up for Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just jump right into the actual
kind of meat of everything and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll look at the definition of turpenes
from a few different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: A biochemist would say that turpenes are
an aromatic hydrocarbon made of ice and
[SPEAKER_01]: creek and what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes are the largest most diverse
class of organic molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odds are if you smell something and it is
a natural aromatic component it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: turpene or it started as a turpene and
degraded into something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between a turpene and a
turbinoid is subtle but I think everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: in this room should know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead a turpene is produced by a plant
while it's living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that once it's been removed
from the plant all of the chemicals become
[SPEAKER_01]: turbinoids but turbinoids are oxidized
turpenes so rather than just being a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbon which just as it sounds means
that it's being just hydrogen and carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the functional groups has been
replaced and it becomes a turbinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes are also lipids or flat fats
which we're all familiar with when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lipids generally are hydrophobic and
they're unable to dissolve in water so the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing is very true of turpenes and
all essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just put them into water and
have them dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure that you have some
sort of other fat-based substance that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can emulsify with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for something to be called aromatic
this is pretty interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to contain at least one benzene
ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benzene is the central structure of
thousands of organic molecules and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: composed of six carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the common psychotropic substances
that we're familiar with contain at least
[SPEAKER_01]: one benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amphetamine, ketamine, MDA,
MDMA, LSD25, mescaline and all of the
cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're THC, CBD, CBG and all of their
various formations are also considered
[SPEAKER_01]: aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a benzene ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: This term was actually coined because when
they, aromatic rather, was coined because
[SPEAKER_01]: when they started looking into turbenes
the chemistry wasn't there for
[SPEAKER_01]: identification at the time so they started
to notice that a lot of these scented
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents like compounds also had a sweet
and aromatic, pleasing smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was about 1855.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then the term aromatic in chemistry
has been repurposed and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually mean that something has a scent
but it means that it has a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just an important note when it comes to
essential oils just because you hear that
[SPEAKER_01]: something is aromatic doesn't mean that it
necessarily has a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, so they're aromatic
hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrocarbons means that it's made out of
an arrangement of hydrogen and carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of hydrocarbons that are
found in earth naturally occur in crude
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and this is because decomposed organic
plant material is basically in these vast
wells and there's an abundance of hydrogen
and carbon that can be formed into all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of various shapes and shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like I said, the final part of
that definition is that they're made of
[SPEAKER_01]: isoprene and isoprene is a building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: All turbenes are made up and classified by
the number of units of isoprene that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're made up which for simplicity sake
you can just remember means that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: five carbon molecule and if there's more
it's heavier and if it's heavier it means
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's going to be less volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stay quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to spill out some drops here
it's not going to necessarily evaporate as
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a lighter molecule it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxygen from the heart it can leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a heavier molecule it's going to
stick around longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also probably has a scent that will
stick around longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two, three terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three terms that everybody probably should
be familiar with is mono-terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mono-terpene makes up the majority of
the terpenes that we're all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinene, limonene, nersene will go kind of
into more in just a moment but those are
[SPEAKER_01]: all mono-terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are 10 carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a little bit confusing
because mono you think one but just
[SPEAKER_01]: remember in this case mono means two and
sesquiterpenes which are made up of three
[SPEAKER_01]: and are slightly heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: These different classes of terpenes have
different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monoterpenes tend to be antimicrobial and
antibacterial whereas for instance a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sesquiterpenes being that they're
heavier have properties more along the
lines of being analgesic and
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the third term just to kind of put
into perspective how many things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world are terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been about 50,000 identified but
rubber is actually a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said so if mono-terpenes are two
units and sesquiterpenes are three units,
[SPEAKER_01]: rubber is any variety of terpenes that
have more than 100 units of ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a vast class of different types.
I've already touched on the difference
between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what an aromatherapist might say about
what a terpene is and I've also lumped
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aromatherapy is the practice of using
aromatic volatile plant oils for
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological and physical well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind one more time I'll try not to
repeat it again but aromatic doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that it necessarily is actually scented.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more along the lines of what the
chemical structure says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite a few more chemicals than we
might even think.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an aromatherapist might say terpenes
are the building blocks that collectively
[SPEAKER_01]: come together to form the essential oils
that so many of us are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just two quick examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linolol is found in lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes up about 33% of the oils
that make up lavender.
Another one is found in high quantity is
one called linoleic acetate which makes up
about another third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the largest list that I've
seen there's 38 other components that are
[SPEAKER_01]: listed along the same lines that make up
that other third of the profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of seems like to be the rule
of thumb when it comes to the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile being all sorts of different
essential oils whether it's cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's any sort of herbal preparation it
seems like there's a couple outliers that
[SPEAKER_01]: really define the sample and then there's
a multitude of small just as important if
[SPEAKER_01]: not more important in a lot of cases
components that really add to that
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other terpene that I'll just kind of
off the cuff mention is limonene which can
[SPEAKER_01]: make up up to half of lemon oil and I
think a lot of us are familiar with that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's used in all sorts of different
commercial products like Gugon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast Orange, any really sort of orange
citrus scented that commercial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being that terpenes make up such a
large portion of these plant oils and are
[SPEAKER_01]: aromatics as well, cannabinoids as I said
a moment ago is also found in that same
[SPEAKER_01]: class.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are aromatic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really that makes cannabis use aroma
therapy by definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using aromatic plant oils for our
psychological and physical well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really think that most of us
think of ourselves as practicing aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably all view cannabis use a little
bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we should really all add this
to our toolbox to be able to say let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: have some aroma therapy rather than say
let's go stand in a circle out front or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever version of that you want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of progressive and it's
really acknowledging the fact that what we
[SPEAKER_01]: do should be normalized that it's got a
rhyme or reason to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just, it's not drug use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally I think most people,
at least if you were like me maybe three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four years ago, you think of aroma
therapy and I thought of people inhaling
[SPEAKER_01]: scented candles or plant oils without a
protocol, without a methodology,
[SPEAKER_01]: really just relying on what feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what cannabis use is mostly in
our culture today.
[SPEAKER_01]: People consume enough until they feel
good, sometimes you go too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly there's not really,
at least for myself until recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not much of a protocol for how to
consume something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not entirely our fault because the
data hasn't been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There hasn't been a label on our packaging
that says these chemicals are in this
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and based upon any other than I can
look at it and based upon what I know I
[SPEAKER_01]: can say oh I better stop after one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hasn't been available but it is
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to point out that within aroma
therapy, which has been used for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the exact amount of time,
but people have been using herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: preparations for quite some time,
it's taken until about three decades ago
[SPEAKER_01]: for there to be any sort of peer-reviewed
research that shows that aroma therapy
[SPEAKER_01]: practiced with a rhyme or reason can have
great patient outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really want to encourage
everybody in this room to really look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the advances in cannabis testing labs
and the requirement for people to test
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis in order for it to be sold
on the open market, we're going to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: standardized results and that's something
that I'm extremely happy about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to, I don't want to take
away the craft cannabis, I don't want that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of side of things to disappear,
but for people that are seeking relief,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the ability to really identify
what it is that they're consuming and come
[SPEAKER_01]: back to that and purchase it and use it
consistently is the next evolution for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially to grow as a body of people
that are using this sort of medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: really promote it, I think that for us to
reach the greatest number of people we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to give duplicative results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to skip this little section
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, in this section here we're
going to look at what a botanical view on
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are, what a biologist might say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And terpene is an organic molecule that's
produced by living organisms in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate with the world around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not produced in cannabis,
for instance, just because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: tangents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not there for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very specific roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are manufactured within plants in
order to adapt with the world around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain varieties have progenated in parts
of the world where there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial threat or there's a certain
fungal threat and because of this the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has over time developed the ability
to thrive because of the essential oil
[SPEAKER_01]: content, the terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's found in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are found in just about every
living organism, like I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That includes plants, algae, fungus,
mammals, and vertebrates and reptiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been over 50,000 of them isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, through Google searching and
asking, I emailed a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: university professors that have
specialized within terpenes and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry, have not been able to identify
living organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in all of us.
And that's because terpenes are part of
the class of chemicals when they're
produced by a living organism known as
hormones and pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, to kind of define those two
terms real quick, a hormone is a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: which communicates within an organism and
a pheromone is a chemical which
[SPEAKER_01]: communicates with other organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the musk that humans create
to be scent that all sorts of variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: mammals leave behind in your yard,
those are pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are, they're potentially
containing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a recent journal article by the
Netherlands Institute of Ecology,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was claimed that terpenes is the most
widely spoken language on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because microbial creatures and
fungus were found to be communicating with
[SPEAKER_01]: one another through terpene interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really a beautiful picture of
what terpenes are actually for in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that being organic living
biological creatures, we're fortunate to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to take advantage of the fact that
we can go and extract or harvest terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: from all sorts of plants and really use
them to our benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, none of us
would be here without terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of the foliage or the fauna that
we really get to enjoy as members of this
[SPEAKER_01]: world would be here without terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when it comes to cannabis,
terpenes act as pheromones in various ways
[SPEAKER_01]: and, or sorry, in obvious ways and likely
as hormones as well, though I'm not really
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with those, the internal side of
terpenes within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more familiar with what they do
externally in communicating with other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're pheromones and they communicate
externally and they're used as a defense
[SPEAKER_01]: agent primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're produced in the greatest volume in
the trichome heads, although they are
[SPEAKER_01]: found in the stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they specifically do things like
defend buds from predators, small
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial threads or insects are not able
to tolerate terpenes at the same level
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have solvent like properties and they
can, probably most of you aren't like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've overdone it orally before and had
a pretty bad chemical burn in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can only imagine that that's what
happens to some sort of mite that's
[SPEAKER_01]: munching down on the wrong plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, they also, primarily I
think, especially, and you guys are very
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with this, the right terpene
content can make all the difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting off a fungal or a bacterial
infection, you know, your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain varieties do very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the terpenes obviously,
it's the structure and morphology of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but the right chemical content in
the right environment really does make all
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the evolution of terpenes,
it's obvious that pleasant smells also
[SPEAKER_01]: have a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that really is is that the
predators of herbivores are drawn in by
[SPEAKER_01]: these pleasant smells and early humans,
it's surmised by Robert Clark,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually were brought to the plants and
shown that they were special because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the scents and the beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the terpenes also make the
flowers rather unpleasant to consume,
[SPEAKER_01]: we left them alone, but we admired them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our presence kept away other mammals
that might interfere with those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the plant really isn't usable
to an early human until the seeds have
[SPEAKER_01]: been produced, we were co-contributors in
allowing these plants to run their life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle to be pollinated and to progenate
seeds so they completed their mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've even helped them by picking
those, thrashing them against the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing some of them to spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, a lot of that had to
do with the pleasant smells that these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of one picture, I think at a
level that most of us can understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes really, as far as the life cycle
of cannabis, have contributed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution that it's seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've read the, I'm gonna skip that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I think is notable for
cannabis consumers is that when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming cannabis, we're not really
getting it at its peak terpene content
[SPEAKER_01]: because that plant does not produce
terpenes for use after it's died.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no use for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really about 90% of the way through
flower, really you're introduced to the
[SPEAKER_01]: most beautiful aroma that cannabis is able
to produce because that plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's secreting the most amount
of resin so that it can capture,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, A, so that it can withhold moisture,
but also so that it can capture some
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and impregnate itself and produce
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trying to take the most amount of
terpenes because it's trying to prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: itself late in season from molding or
becoming susceptible to some sort of other
[SPEAKER_01]: invasive organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I think a lot of you have
probably went into a grow room right after
[SPEAKER_01]: your lights have switched on and
experienced this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get in there, it's kind of
green and earthy scented.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights come on, 70 degrees hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things start to volatilize right around
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the alfapine first as the bloom
rises.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start getting into some of the citrus
notes and keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get into some of the earthy tones,
beta-cariophylline, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fugilene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing can be said outside,
on a hillside and outside and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go from those cool mornings when
you're out dragging lines to get water in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground and then as it warms up,
you go from the cool earthy morning to the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of floral and citrusy and piney
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a big part as to why
growing cannabis is so therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the room with these plants that
are respirating chemicals at levels that
[SPEAKER_01]: are definitely detectable and definitely
therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same way that putting essential
oils in the diffuser in the back of the
[SPEAKER_01]: room puts them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know from experience in putting them
into a room like this, it really allows
[SPEAKER_01]: people to loosen up and be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a space where anxiety kind of
melts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we all come from days that were
different before this, but I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: to think that when we're consuming the
same essence, we really start to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: a vibe that kind of emulates to one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I would say that
there's three different fields that really
[SPEAKER_01]: retain the terpenes that we're probably
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a biological, botanical outlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a chemical outlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an aromatherapy and cannabis
outlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm a little bit better at
answering specific questions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afterwards, if anybody has any questions
that would go down those paths,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would invite them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'd like to move on to right now is
the extraction of terpenes, how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them out of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll go into what to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are extracted by a few different
methods commercially right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's primarily done through the
redistillation of essential oils or
[SPEAKER_01]: through the use of food refuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, the greatest amount of
limiting comes out of the refuse from
[SPEAKER_01]: orange juice factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cold pressed through a process
called expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a spike that presses and
it's really the only terpene that's done
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me start to think recently about
how rosin is a very unique aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation because there's not very many
plants that are produced under
[SPEAKER_01]: the expression technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The use of pressure in this regard is just
as unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a thought for looking into why
that particular preparation is unique,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other processes we're going to
go, let's say the next one is steam
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of you are probably familiar
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically taking a flask,
you're filling it with water, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting plant material above it,
the water is passing through it and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not actually dissolving the terpenes
because they're oils, they're hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually creating pressure which is
lifting them off of the plant material and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's going through a cooling chamber
where it then recondenses into a liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: and it falls down and the water is
separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is solvent extraction which produces
products known as absolutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically this is the process that most of
us are familiar with if you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: extractor, if you're making butane and ash
oil or CO2 is kind of on the edge,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of its own thing but butane,
propane, ethanol, these are all producing
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it's a process where you're
washing plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us are familiar with that and
then you've got to remove that solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: from the final liquid and what's left over
is a different version.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same thing as an essential
oil which has only been used, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: lifted the terpenes off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got further phytochemicals that are
in there and I think it's our assumption
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis community to think,
oh there's more phytochemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: that must mean that it's better medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily the case absolutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily, generally are not used for
consumable products just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't have leftover solvents in them and
it's just not quite as light of an
[SPEAKER_01]: essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what my company primarily relies on
is vacuum distillation which is very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to steam distillation but we're
doing it at lower temperatures and under
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking that same glassware and
you're putting it under vacuum,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sucking the atmosphere out of it,
you're removing the oxygen so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: boiling temperatures go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these are volatile chemicals when
you expose them to heat, they expand and
[SPEAKER_01]: when they expand, when they come back,
the molecule is distorted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might begin to oxidize, there's a
variety of different chemical reactions
[SPEAKER_01]: that can happen depending on what you're
working with and what the vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation allows you to do is to use
less energy just to distort that molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: less in order to get it to travel up that
path, come back down and then to return to
[SPEAKER_01]: normal form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was actually surprised to have met
somebody tonight who does this method of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene or rather essential oil
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not primarily used in terpenes but it
is used in essential oils and I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: would just be good for everybody to know
how far we've come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think of vacuum distillation
often as like space chemistry because we
[SPEAKER_01]: are removing the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally doing an experiment that
could not be done on the surface of earth
[SPEAKER_01]: without vacuum pumps and highly advanced
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original form of extraction was
actually enfrage which is taking animal
[SPEAKER_01]: fats, layering plant material in them and
because terpenes are lipids and because
[SPEAKER_01]: the animal fat is a lipid, you're able to
get terpenes to dissolve into the animal
[SPEAKER_01]: fat and then they basically just
continually layer layers of plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: by replacing it and kind of get this rich
fatty essential oil preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I particularly
find,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not something that I would
necessarily want to consume or use in my
[SPEAKER_01]: everyday life but it is just kind of a
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: People did whatever they could at the
beginning of kind of modern era of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: these oils into a useful format and they
found that fat would do it and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of already touched on what my
company does to recreate turkey profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just going to give you a quick
rundown of what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take a cannabis sample of
particular interest and we will send it to
[SPEAKER_01]: a cannabis lab if we're trying to get a
quick result or we will send it to a
[SPEAKER_01]: perfume lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a company that's at the
University of Indiana actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was founded there and then they kind of
separated, there's a bunch of guys from
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then they separated out and
started a company and because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: perfumes lab and they built this specific
library for their GCMS gas chromatography
[SPEAKER_01]: and spectrometry, they are able to
identify more individual compounds than
[SPEAKER_01]: any other lab in America and maybe the
world at this point and that's good
[SPEAKER_01]: because more data allows us to get closer
to a profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice that his prestige is out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will basically send it off for a
report and they basically send us back a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says in this sample of oil that you
mailed to us, we have beta pining and down
[SPEAKER_01]: the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally we're getting somewhere between
50 and 80 hits from this particular lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lab in Vancouver, Canada that's
able to do over 250 but it's an extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive process and you've got to wait
in line to be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that data, we don't even have a lot
of components to actually be able to redo
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 80 seems to be about the most that we
want to actually see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've given this recipe, we take from
our isolated stock of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've rebuilt the profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes some, because we're not
identically replicating the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes some trial and error to actually
be able to produce something that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell out into the market and that's you or
myself or anybody could take, add to
[SPEAKER_01]: distillate, add the CO2 and get a product
that they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide a recipe for each individual
profile as to how much you should use in
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and it's pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the application of terpenes in product
development, like I said, there's taking
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are devoid of terpenes like
distillate and reintroducing a profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: your favorite, of your choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we really encourage people to do and
what we work off of whenever we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: with those cannabis lab samples is we try
to reproduce the flower profile rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than the profile of an extract or a
distillation, specifically because in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in cannabis medically and from
kind of an overwhelming majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, that's what people are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get as close to it as they
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this is a...
[SPEAKER_02]: They want a whole plant but they don't
want the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want it and they want to use it
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't really get flower to fit
into a vape pen, you know, an oil vape
[SPEAKER_01]: pen, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really try to recreate the profiles
as they're found in flower and then
[SPEAKER_01]: because of that it gives people the
ability to concentrate it if they'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can use more which then results in
like, you know, you could double up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be closer to an extract profile than
you might be in a flower profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of making a quick shift here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just point out a couple things
that people can do at home pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the components that I'm going to
talk about are available on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give me a call and said that you
were here, I'll give you a real good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to make money off this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to just experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding terpenes to aromatherapy
diffusers I think is one of the easiest
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you can do at your business or
at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put them in our diffuser every night
before we go to bed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think about it, a lot of these
compounds have all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: properties that we're discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're anti-inflammatory, they are
anti-bacterial, they're anti-microbial,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're anti-fungal and it's my thought
that getting them in our environment
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently can lead to better health
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're putting something
that's anti-bacterial into the air in your
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom, you know, what does that do over
time to your health over flu season,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aromatherapy diffusers, extremely easy
to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite things to do is to take
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-karyophylline is the terpene that is
found in black peppercorns and cloves
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sesquiterpene, it's heavy,
it's spicy and I like to combine it with
[SPEAKER_01]: olive oil or with coconut oil in either a
one-to-one, all the way up to like a one
[SPEAKER_01]: part beta-karyophylline, five parts olive
oil formulation, kind of depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the most rapidly anti-inflammatory
substance that I've ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read things that say it's 300 times
more anti-inflammatory than your average
aspirin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't come up with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a patient out of Texas
call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gentleman that has, he's a
quadriplegic, basically said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: over the last 30 years I've used every
single available topical treatment to work
[SPEAKER_01]: on the phantom limb pains that I deal with
and nothing has ever worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, nothing has, you know,
things that have worked have taken time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said basically from about two
minutes in from using the substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: he went from having like a knife digging
into his skin to really just being needed
[SPEAKER_01]: and feeling just pressure but not feeling
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he uses it still in this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him a really good deal kind of just
to keep up with us and to keep giving us
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very easy preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the early things that I showed
Shango when we first met that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: really impressed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I hear from a lot of
our clients is using limonene for
[SPEAKER_01]: gastroesophila reflux disease or,
you know, basically your common acid
[SPEAKER_01]: reflux or indigestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been told by people,
and again, I'm not a healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: professional, but what I've been told by
people is three to five drops added to a
[SPEAKER_01]: glass of water consumed before a meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically it's, if people are
replacing type drugs like Celexa and other
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-acid type drugs, not choking down
pebble bits and all that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that a lot of people are
using right now that I find of interest is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using geranium, which is,
if you wanted to take a common phrase and
[SPEAKER_01]: rephrase it, you would say, take time in
life to stop and smell the geranium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the primary terpene that's found in
roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This substance is being used diluted in
water and sprayed on golf courses in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida right now by one of my largest
clients as a specific pesticide to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: insects off of the greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked into, so there's a couple of
insecticides that are made for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry right now that are using
terpenes and all of them have geranium
[SPEAKER_01]: listed as their primary active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a tip for people to look
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of going back to limonene,
what a lot of people use it for,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned earlier, is for degreasing
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's cleaning a kitchen or your
hands after doing some auto work,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organic means to remove grease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limonene by itself, uncut, is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I do want to make everybody
aware of is that limonene is
[SPEAKER_01]: photosensitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are putting it on your skin
directly, and I would really highly advise
[SPEAKER_01]: avoiding the sun, because you can get
burnt very, very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enhances the effects of UV
dramatically, and people have gotten very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very severe burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to be careful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask Shenko to give me a hand
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so what you're looking at is
something new for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't given it out before,
so this is kind of the first group of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I wasn't lying when I
said I thought this was a good crowd to
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of turn into terpene advocates
and take your tools and be able to go out,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's showing people your kit or
just having the knowledge to really
[SPEAKER_01]: identify things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to share just real briefly
here, Shenko says we have about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes, what published literature and my
own experience say about each one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, I'd like you to take it
out, open the cap, and smell that party
[SPEAKER_01]: through it as we go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said earlier, another important
thing to note on these is these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes that are found in the greatest
quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are not necessarily the terpenes
that contribute the most amount of smell
[SPEAKER_01]: to any one particular strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the example that I would use is my
company makes a blue cheese replica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a terpene in it called isobaric
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isobaric acid is less than a tenth of a
percent, less than 100% of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is overwhelmed into the first thing
people smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another terpene similar to that is that
isobaric acid, which is the skunk terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keep in mind, small quantities can
have great traumatic effects, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: also contribute greatly to the actual
therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to terpenes, more does
not mean more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I sell is food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start with Mirstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have an orange label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mirstein is a mono terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is herby, it's woody, it's sweet,
and it's an aroma that is suggestive of
[SPEAKER_01]: hops and cloves and crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's regular botanical sources are hops,
thyme, lemongrass, basil, and bay leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most dominant terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: In common circulating strains of cannabis,
and that's partly due to, as many of us
[SPEAKER_01]: know, the drug war, which required that we
drive up the THC in order to get the least
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of drugs out there with the
greatest bang for their buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mirstein really kind of tagged along
on that ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steep Hill Labs defines any strain with
over 0.5% by volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mirstein has an indica strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of, I hope I don't crush
anybody's childhood here, but many people
[SPEAKER_01]: have been led to believe that mangoes
contain a large amount of Mirstein,
[SPEAKER_01]: a notable amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found an analysis which goes over 20
varieties of mangoes, and they found at
[SPEAKER_01]: most in one fruit, 0.86 milligrams of
Mirstein, whereas even middle of the road
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of cannabis might have 2
milligrams per gram of Mirstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that mangoes don't hit
you higher, but it's really probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: of an entourage effect, because there's
quite a bit of terpenaline in mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, let's see if I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's terpenaline, lemony,
alkylandry, and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_01]: botanicals along with Mirstein that
probably contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not Mirstein mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mangoes are an incredible botanical
source of a variety of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one is going to be,
oh sorry, we'll take it on the part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: chiropractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mirstein is known to reduce pain and
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, my company's playing around
with a sleep aid that is purely Mirstein
[SPEAKER_01]: emulsified into a substance that makes it
much more bioactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not met some, I have a couple test
subjects from the clinic that I met that
[SPEAKER_01]: suffer from severe pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
Mirstein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mirstein emulsified into a substance that
makes it much more bioactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mirstein emulsified into a substance
that makes it much more bioactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is fresh and sweet and citrusy,
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all experienced this terpene in our
household cleaners.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are quick to say,
lemony is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a household cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not safe to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just say that lemony is an
incredible organic compound that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: wide variety of uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to us, it's found its way into being a
degreaser, but it's not a greaser that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organic molecule that's been used
in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemony is primarily sourced by the
expression of citrus fruits, including
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit, lime, lemon, and orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-lemonine is the terpene that you have in
front of you, which is primarily from
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, the orange juice
industry produces most of the refuse that
[SPEAKER_01]: is then pressed and the terpenes are
extracted from fruit vacuum distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: People tend to think of it as energizing,
and I think that's another kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a factoid is something that people
think of as a fact, but it isn't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a factoid as well,
because there's no evidence that shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is a stimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is an anxiolytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I really picture it is
that it allows you to take all that energy
[SPEAKER_01]: that you would use on stress or some of
it, and you're not only saving that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to then put it towards other
kind of life processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is mood-elevating, it's
stress-relieving, it's focusing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's got a wide application,
like I said, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gastrointestinal, or it's also highly
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used to dissolve gallstones in
clinical settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple studies that show outside
of the human body that it destroys breast
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it affects cell permeability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a presence of mucine allows other
phytochemicals to actually break through
[SPEAKER_01]: the blood-brain barrier and take effect at
a greater dramatic impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one, terpenoline, is a purple label.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a monotermine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fresh and herbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sweet and piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smell it, I smell lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is sourced from apples,
cumin, lilac, tea tree, and pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very popular in the United States
for the use in flavors and fragrances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavily used in soaps and detergents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been linked to
anti-proliferation within cancer cells as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study specifically suggests that by
down-regulating specific proteins,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoline helps slow the spread of
breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sedative and calming, and also an
antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one quick note that I just want to
make is that there is quite a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: information about each one of these on our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the things that I'm saying about
these are the textbook answers,
[SPEAKER_01]: not your anecdotal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one particularly is from coniferous
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the listing, I can give you
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one would be albapiney.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a red label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albapiney is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely the top of my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's earthy, piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a sharp, bitter flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sourced from coniferous trees,
rosemary, and sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also found in a couple varieties of
citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is anti-inflammatory, and it acts as a
bronchodilator, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first heard this, I kind of thought
I was silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I've met so many people that use
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've heard cannabis can be good
for asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's the strains of
cannabis that have high amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: albapiney that contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as pharmacologically, it's great
for pain, inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the few terpenes that has
neuro-stimulant properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also good for focus and mood
alteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what our company has always done,
because there really isn't any clinical,
[SPEAKER_01]: standalone, isolated terpene research to
support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've always looked at is what is the
highest amount we could find in a gram of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the highest amount we could
find in cannabis through analytical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a rule of thumb, we suggest one to
five percent by volume in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products for most of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the six that we're looking at right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't really say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really more kind of a self-discovery
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is going to be
beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up until this point, everything that
we've discussed has been a mono-terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-karyophylline is a sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to remind you, that's a heavier
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to feel the consistency of all
the ones that we've felt up until now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd find that they're rather thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They leak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can screw a top on that doesn't
have that little cone inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will leak their way out of it
because they're much thinner than water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Allison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely each rubber and silicone,
most terpenes will.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a light green label also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular terpene is sweet and
spicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's naturally sourced from black pepper,
caraway, clove, hops, basil, oregano.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's notable because it's the only
phyto-cannabinoid that's found in nature
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It acts on the CB2 receptors, which makes
the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think many people in this room have
probably heard that black pepper and cumin
come together to make a powerful
anti-inflammatory combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's curcumin and beta-karyophylline
coming together to create a synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: pair that's more powerful than the two
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beta-karyophylline, like I said
earlier, massively anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively safe for topical from
everything that I've been able to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used a lot of it topically,
so I would say that so far I personally
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't had any negative reaction with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you're ever applying any
oils topically, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put them on a very small portion of your
skin and wait to see what happens for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple days before you dive into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really, with essential oils and
terpenes, it's not so much a single
[SPEAKER_01]: application that might get you,
but it's the application over the course
[SPEAKER_01]: of maybe 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just make sure that you're not doing it
every day and that you're definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: giving yourself time to observe what
happens to you.
Pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, calming, focus, mood
elevator.
I spilled a ton of this on my feet
actually one time and wore those shoes for
a while.
By the end of the day, I was definitely
feeling it, the mood elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last one in there, it's got a
purple label on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's got another kind of green label
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mono-terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got kind of a spicy, sweet overtone
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sourced from a variety of plants,
primarily those in the mint family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also bailey, camphor,
lavender, bilox.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said earlier, literal itself makes up
about a third of all that oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is shown to block the stimulus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't pronounce that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blocks the stimulus that causes us pain on
a neurological level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Studies have linked it to decreased
depression symptoms, which is likely due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fact that it amplifies serotonin
receptor transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got pain and depression kind of
covered there, which it also touches on
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation and sleep as well entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want everybody to use it as they
best see fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I would invite everybody to take one
of my cards off the back and give me
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How could I improve upon it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we have information on the
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on an app right now so that
you can take that information with you,
share it with people.
Yeah?
What's in these bottles?
Just terpene.
That's what a terpene is.
So you know, essential oil is very
similar.
It's a building block of that.
So yeah, it's just purely terpene.
There's no barrier.
So the purity does vary.
One of them is slightly different,
but basically upwards of about 85%.
But it's all terpene.
I'm going to go ahead.
Yeah, let's take a couple questions and
we'll let Jago finish this off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it and I skipped over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can take the, until, let's say,
three more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you repeat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, what is the relationship of
terpenes displayed in rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the relationship between terpenes
displayed in rates?
What is the relationship between terpenes
displayed
[SPEAKER_01]: in rates?
What is the relationship between terpenes
displayed in rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the relationship between terpenes
displayed in rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why you would want to be
very scientific about reintroducing
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes to an oil product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern is when you're talking
about it, you said there can be up to 260
[SPEAKER_00]: various ones, but yet the labs that you're
using don't measure a certain percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an analogy would be that you're
digitizing music, but you're losing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're reading it.
So that's both a question and a potential
problem in my mind.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
Please discuss that.
So you're absolutely right.
And I struggled with that for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when we made the leap from just
providing isolates for kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'd say, reparational home science,
people just gave me their hands and were
[SPEAKER_01]: like, whoa, they have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we started as.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we move into the profiles and I ask
myself those same questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really came up with is people
are making products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in this marketplace right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking THC distillate or CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting it into a bagel pen and
they're selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to cut it into something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't sell them terpenes,
then they're using vape footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using all sorts of varieties of
propylene glycol and propanethyl glycol,
[SPEAKER_01]: MCT, which has very little, very little
therapeutic value, if not detrimental
[SPEAKER_01]: value towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, like I said, we do send
samples off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on our ability to source all
of the individual compounds to build that
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, but nothing replaces canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what my follow-on was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about the effects
of these terpenes and how some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller percentages are actually having a
greater effect, that suggests that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all based on ratio, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also the ratio between terpenes and all
of the tamponades are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole other magnitude of
complexity to figure out how those things
[SPEAKER_00]: actually result in therapeutic value,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you were talking about is
incredibly fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But combining that with some of this
higher level, anyway, just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no, I appreciate you kind of
reading into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I really wanted to
touch on is I think one of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we do offer, though, as long as it,
and I'm maybe not the expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to think of myself as a true
expert in this, but I'm not the expert to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this determination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've found fascinating for myself
is learning about what the terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: we do have access to actually do to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like adding access to beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, whoa, that is stimulating in
this regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whoa, alpha-pinene opens up my lungs
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we've also really
fixated on, is learning how individual
[SPEAKER_01]: components affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, like you said, there's this
entourage, there's this symphony,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these minor components matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're in the race
to discover and work towards being
replicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, right now, we work with everything
that's purely natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to really recreate everything in the
future, at least for a self-discovery
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose, I think we're going to have to
move it in a synthetic route to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get these things.
We'll talk later.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the user, and I was curious as to
how this got in order, and also about how
[SPEAKER_04]: much would you use, if you wanted to use
it in maybe food?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are people that are putting them
into art candies and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, again, would suggest is using
cannabis as the guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've always done.
So if you're going to try to replicate
something and you'd like to use an
isolate, take a whole plant of cannabis,
make it into an edible, send it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, have one do an analysis on it,
and then work off of that.
See what's making itself, maybe what's
making its way into the final product,
and then try to replicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we're able to go, I think it's going
to take a decade or something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: for the amount of funding and interest to
really get into the universities and take
[SPEAKER_01]: us down that path, to be able to say sort
of the definitive answer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, and then we have to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two quick things, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to support, I think, what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I hear you saying is you're producing
products that are allowing people to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to consistently replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that even though you're distilling
some of these sort of complex whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: formulations down to simpler combinations,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Much can be said for the benefit of using
aspirin as opposed to creating a tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: from willow bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aspirin works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willow bark might work better for certain
people in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess my question is, so I think
it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I quote what you're doing,
because I think it's helped medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patients tremendously to have that
consistent, effective, and reliable
[SPEAKER_02]: medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering how far along you guys are
in terms of determining what are some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the more limited combinations of terpenes
for specific applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say limited, do you mean trace
amounts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of 80 terpenes in a mixture,
you need half a dozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so like how many we're putting into
our blends, basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 to 50 is what we're up to right now,
depending on the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, we sell 23 different blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to release another six next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on which strain that was,
some of them have individual components
[SPEAKER_01]: that either weren't present or were below
the limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not present in a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those varieties, specifically
more of the indica dominant, heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: near-seen dominant strains, we have more
of those isolates available put into the
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had a greater variety detected
when we ran them through the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't know what the effective
all 50 of those are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you also looking at, like Lillibar
to aspirin, starting to sort of get a
[SPEAKER_02]: finer vision, more distribution into the
most active components of the limit you're
reading?
I wish that my partner was here.
Because he really does a lot of work in
that realm.
And I think that he would have a better
answer than I do.
I know that we're better than when we
began on understanding what is.
You're asking, basically, do we know which
of these components is contributing to
this?
Do we know which effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it takes a little bit more
highly sophisticated science than what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working with to really make those
determinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state of the art might not even be
there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, aromatherapy looks at holes for
desired outcomes.
That field isn't there yet.
How much larger is that actual industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come back to you afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know we can do questions online,
but we really need to wrap up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
