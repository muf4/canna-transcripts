[SPEAKER_02]: Humans have been burning cannabis since
our earliest relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cave evidence shows that early humans
would take whole cannabis plants and put
[SPEAKER_02]: them on small fires in caves and
essentially hotbox the cave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would have a mystical
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And done with the right intentions,
we still can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love smoking cannabis because the lungs
provide a speedy and efficient way to get
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cannabinoids into our blood and
into our brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why smoking comes on faster than
any other method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are at least two strong reasons to
consider vaporizers, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is that not everyone has lungs
of steel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the longer we smoke hot plant material
and tar, the more impact our lungs take
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also folks who have other
respiratory diseases like COPD,
[SPEAKER_02]: where cannabis smoking can be used as a
medicine, but smoking anything at all is
[SPEAKER_02]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: For asthmatics like myself and other folks
with respiratory issues, vaporizers create
[SPEAKER_02]: a fun and effective method for us to be
able to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second strong reason to consider
vaporizers is how much improved the taste
[SPEAKER_02]: can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to enjoy cannabis flower
without all the burning plant material
[SPEAKER_02]: getting in the way of the terpene profile
is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us love the intense flavors of dab
oil without the plant as contaminant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaping flowers is similar in that we are
inhaling the resin of the flower without
[SPEAKER_02]: taking in all the burnt plant particulate
and tar that gets in the way of true
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've likely heard me talk about cannabis
from an asthmatic perspective before,
[SPEAKER_02]: both here on the podcast and on the
Shaping Fire YouTube channel as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Shaping Fire episode 36, on cannabis
and breathing with Robert Litman,
[SPEAKER_02]: we discussed how best to inhale cannabis
to preserve your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to incorporate cannabis into asthma
and COPD care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we addressed the long time myth that
holding your hits gets you higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spoiler, it's hypoxia, not THC that makes
you feel higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's episode is a blend of cannabis
medicine ideas and cannabis engineering
[SPEAKER_02]: ideas.

[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guest today is aerospace engineer,
Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark is a lifelong engineer of systems,
machines, and organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been an aerospace engineer for
Hughes Space and Communications in Los
[SPEAKER_02]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking for new challenges, Mark joined
the Peace Corps and went into the jungles
[SPEAKER_02]: of Fiji to teach science and help with
revitalizing schools there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This experience profoundly shaped his
views on the critical impact that
[SPEAKER_02]: education plays in society, which led him
to commit 15 years to improving K-12
[SPEAKER_02]: education and becoming the statewide
policy director for STEM education in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most recently though, Mark Lewis is again
an engineer and inventor of novel
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporization devices for cannabis products
through his company, Pearl Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: His award-winning designs have been
honored by the 2022 Core 77 Design Awards
[SPEAKER_02]: and selected as the 2022 Best Design
Vaporizer by Kanigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I discovered Mark's through his first and
product-class vaporizer invention called
[SPEAKER_02]: the Neo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Neo can be used with any pipe or bong
or rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine lighting your cannabis with a
lighter like we always have, turning it
[SPEAKER_02]: upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead, that lighter gives off really
intense radiant heat instead of flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put his vape lighter over your
flower or oil and it vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't anything like it on the market
and I love mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mark is not here to talk about his
company at all today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I don't do company, person,
or product profiles on shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do topics, topics that you're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mark is here as my science and
engineering expert to break down the
[SPEAKER_02]: science and engineering behind modern
vaporizers without talking about his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the first set today, we will
discuss why cannabis enthusiasts vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the advantages and
disadvantages and the differences between
[SPEAKER_02]: burning cannabis flowers and oil versus
vaporizing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second set is devoted to engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will look at the three families of
vaporizer technology that make up nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: all the vaporizers available and then
compare and contrast them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will look at them twice, once for
flower and once for oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big set with a lot of details.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will pretty much understand everything
you need to know about vapes as a toker
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third set is short and we focus
specifically on the boiling point myth
[SPEAKER_02]: that conflates evaporation and boiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not the same and it really
impacts your experience with vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to be here, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's dive right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people feel kind of
motivated and nearly religious about their
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizers once they start using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, a lot of people don't
understand the why of vaporizers yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: because in reality, vaporizers aren't used
a ton in the scene yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are still mostly, you know,
lighting their cannabis with fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, humans have been burning
cannabis with fire for thousands of years
[SPEAKER_02]: to like great effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start by talking about the
advantages cannabis enthusiasts are after
[SPEAKER_02]: when they start using a vape device
instead of combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you tell us a little bit about those
advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think first and foremost,
there's the health aspect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime you're actually combusting,
as the people on the West Coast and now
[SPEAKER_00]: the East Coast know the detrimental
effects of the wildfires on their lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: and their eyes, you know, smoke carries a
lot of harmful products in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ash, the soot, the tars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first and foremost, the process of
vaporization removes a lot of those or
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of those detrimental compounds
from what you're inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by and large, they are healthier than
than smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also more efficacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some research studies about
vaporizing flour versus smoking it and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much is bioavailable, how much of the
medicinals and the active ingredients get
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's much higher than than smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the bioavailability of the
compounds, which is also very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think the the smell is one of
the things that, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, I love the smell of,
you know, cannabis being combusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a little powerful for some in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lingers because the smells the
smoke actually gets onto your clothes or
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your into your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the smell of vapor vaporizers tends
to be quite a bit more discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're talking about the vape
pens, the cartridges, then those are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very discreet and very convenient for
people to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really been a benefit to cannabis
portable vaporizers that they became
[SPEAKER_02]: popular the same time as nicotine
vaporizers because people are so used to
[SPEAKER_02]: people busting out nicotine vaporizers
that I can pull out my travel vaporizer
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless they're close enough to smell
the exhale, they you know, people around
[SPEAKER_02]: me have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been a real advantage for all of
us who, you know, attend events or or even
[SPEAKER_02]: just walk along the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a real bone for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's let's talk about the the
advantage also to people who've got
[SPEAKER_02]: preexisting conditions like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like like, you know,
people who listen to this show often know
[SPEAKER_02]: that that I have very severe asthma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I have a respiratory
condition, I have to be gentle on my
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I still smoke joints,
but like I I know after I've smoked a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, when when you go when
I go to events like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup or something where,
you know, you got to puff tough the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really feel that for several
days afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and for for many people with asthma or
COPD, if we want to inhale our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer, are a fantastic option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so less harsh on our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's missing all those ash particles
that that lodge into your your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and and certainly the heavier tars
and oils are also removed from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's much, much easier on on your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when people talk about like the
the the unhealthy aspects of smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost everybody just goes to cancer,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's interesting to hear you
delineate that, you know, the the the bits
[SPEAKER_02]: of smoke and the particles in the smoke,
and the tars and all of those things on
[SPEAKER_02]: their own have their own kind of impacts,
even if they don't eventually lead to
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I try to really avoid,
you know, criticizing people who who smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't think there should be any
sort of judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much social stigma around
smoking these days that I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the reason why not to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really, you know,
from a health and taste and and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability for me, you know,
it's, it's a much more complex experience
[SPEAKER_00]: than smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we'll get to later, but it's also
a different high too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but we also need to be fair,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even though vapes still,
even though vapes are so improved for
[SPEAKER_02]: people's lungs, it's not without its
challenges, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still heated air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still inhaling superheated air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, by the time it well compared to
smoke, which, you know, you can can reach
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures you're inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right at the embers, you're you're
talking, you know, over a thousand degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: at the ember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're smoking a joint,
you're you're looking at five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with vaporizers, you're you're well
down into, you know, the hundreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, into the low hundreds,
you know, 180 200 degrees at the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think by the time it enters your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not done put a thermocouple in my
mouth to measure that vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's I don't experience that
that lung irritation from heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then so then maybe I'm misattributing,
you know, like I talk about vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot with just like regular
heads, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not usually with scientists like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's it's not uncommon
for somebody to say, oh, my gosh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been I've been hitting my vape so
much that my lungs feel crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you have any suggestion on what
what is the attribute of a vaporizer that
[SPEAKER_02]: might make my lungs feel crispy,
especially if it's a flower vape like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my old school packs or
something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make your lungs feel crispy,
you're well, we're going to get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, some of the the things that are
happening out of at a micro level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're really toasting your herbs
strongly, you probably are changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of the terpenes and the
cannabinoids into other thicker oils that
[SPEAKER_00]: can reside then in your lungs and have
that heavy feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then certainly with cartridge based
vaporizers, the carrier oils make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think we know the background around
the Ivali scare a couple of years ago with
[SPEAKER_00]: the vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what was happening,
right is is the carrier oils were were
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting your lung experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's also fair, if we're going to
be talking about the downsides of vaping
[SPEAKER_02]: generally, to talk about what a,
you know, plastic battery waste and trash
[SPEAKER_02]: from packaging nightmare cartridges are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a drag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for years, I mean,
I'm not sure if cartridges have solved
[SPEAKER_02]: this yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for years, I would have a little
Ziploc with, you know, partially finished
[SPEAKER_02]: vape cartridges that just had all of this
waste in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't even going to be able to get
the oil out anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just seemed so wasteful,
like like dube tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I guess we also have to be
careful about, you know, the terpenes for
[SPEAKER_02]: either oil vapes, or for, you know,
even, I guess that would be the only kind
[SPEAKER_02]: because people don't really add terps to
flour, I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we don't really there
really aren't a lot of studies on what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is what it means to to vape the amount of
terpenes that are common in an oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, terpenes are by their very
nature caustic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll, we won't know until it's too
late, if it's actually unhealthy to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you've come across that a lot
as as you have done your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I never recommend that people
add pure terpenes to anything that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking or vaporizing, because they are
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about, you know,
limonene, it's it's a wonderful solvent,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps clean your hands, it can get
stickers off, it can do all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're when you experience
terpenes, and we've, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: group, you grow up smelling flowers,
right, your entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the history of humanity, we've had a
very rich interaction with with terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very beneficial way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in very small amounts, terpenes are
phenomenal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping, keeping as close to nature as
possible is kind of my rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So So let's talk about that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's interesting, because if we
talk about this idea of keeping it as
[SPEAKER_02]: close to nature, and, you know,
if if we humans are are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a thing of nature, and we are a part of
nature, and we are not excluded from
[SPEAKER_02]: nature, the way that we have been using
this natural plant with cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of years have been, you know,
by fire, you know, going into the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pulling out the plant and going
into the cave and putting it on the fire
[SPEAKER_02]: and filling up the cave with smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, then then learning to,
you know, craft little pipes when we could
[SPEAKER_02]: control the fire better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then of course, you know,
eventually developing hash, so we're so
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to store it better and,
and not burn and combust as much of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, so many of us love
that profound good taste of combusting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quality herb that has been grown
and cured properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then yet at the same time,
as we start to use vaporizer, now I am
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoying the same plant in an entirely
different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's giving me a different experience of
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk more about the science
aspects of it later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but it's, it's, it's an entirely
different taste where there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's almost a needed transition period
when somebody goes from flower to
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing, because it is so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you describe the difference in in
taste experience, I guess between
[SPEAKER_02]: combusting and vaporizing the same flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would concur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first and foremost with the experience
of and rituals of consuming a nice joint
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or your pipe or your bong,
I think we have learned to manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with those devices and with
combusting by, you know, that we get a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain feedback that helps us can,
you know, manage our experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're shifting over to,
for example, flower vaporization,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feedback that you're getting is much,
much different, your lungs are not
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing that intense hypoxia,
you know, the, the, you know, constriction
[SPEAKER_00]: and the lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you're taking a deep breath of
vapor that is rich in the cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's, it feels gentler,
but that can be deceptive as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, as I mentioned earlier,
it can get you higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to, you have to learn to
manage your feedback differently with
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers than you do with with our
traditional modes of consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that use of the word feedback,
because I would say the number one
[SPEAKER_02]: complaint that I've heard from people who
are just starting using non-cartridge
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizers is that like, did I,
did I get a hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because the hits with a low
temp, you know, handheld vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, heck, even some of the desktop
ones, it's, it, it feels, the inhale feels
[SPEAKER_02]: so much thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's weird because so many people who
are developing vaporizers, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: because we people keep asking for them,
we want vaporizers that will give us
[SPEAKER_02]: clouds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, in like, clouds are an aesthetic
experience of, of both feeling a good hit,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like feedback you were talking
about, and also the satisfaction of
[SPEAKER_02]: exhaling and seeing this, whoa,
cloud, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, which traditionally is,
is part of the satisfaction from taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: bong rip, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would you talk a little bit about
why, you know, why that hit is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess you've kind of already
addressed that because there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, there's not as much particular in
there, but I guess I would like you to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to more like, are we missing anything
from that thinner feeling hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you, again, when, when you have
smoke and it has the ash and particulates
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff in there, your lungs constrict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get that intensity,
a feeling of, of, of being a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: intense because your, your, your lungs are
responding to these things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are contaminants from its
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you're vaporizing flour,
then your lungs are, are not feeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're getting things that it
recognizes and they're binding to the
[SPEAKER_00]: avioli and then being moved into your,
into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so that's one aspect of it to the
clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a learned feedback that
we, um, are judging, uh, our experience
[SPEAKER_00]: based on these clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, your, your lungs can
only absorb so many compounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that you're exhaling,
uh, with a vaporizer, you're exhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: those active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing a cloud, that's kind of
wasted byproduct because you, your lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't taken them up and, and delivered
them to your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's another way of thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, there's always been
a bit of theater in, in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we enjoy that as part of the social
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's really true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, if, all right, I've got two sides
of this coin, and so I'm going to give you
[SPEAKER_02]: the coin and then you can approach it
however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: On, on, on one side of the coin,
um, you know, we're taking these,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, these, these thinner hits,
I'll say, um, and, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you say sometimes they, they'll actually
get us higher, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then on the other side of that coin
are many people, when they first start
[SPEAKER_02]: vaping, they feel like one hit is not as
satisfying for them and they don't get as
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're all like, well,
you know, I need to take like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, two hits, uh, or three hits of
my, my flower vaporizer to get the same
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback as I would from my bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then also some days you just go
and you have, you know, one hit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizer and you've got this like really
like speedy, bright sativa kind of high,
[SPEAKER_02]: even potentially from, you know,
um, a non equatorial plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that's, that's more
versine rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what, what I'd like you to kind of
just speak to is this idea of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the hits being thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to take more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the misnomer in that, that like,
we actually can get, get wicked high,
[SPEAKER_02]: wicked fast from vaporizers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like how, like as somebody who
studies the technology and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and the user experience, how do you
kind of resolve those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're all true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all, they're all true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the same, let's, let's put some
boundaries on, on where we go with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the same amount of herb,
um, uh, I will claim, and I think research
[SPEAKER_00]: backs me up on this, that, uh,
you will get higher if you completely
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporize the same amount of herb,
um, as smoking, but it's over,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you mentioned over far more hits,
I guess, uh, maybe you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: double or triple the hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet paradoxically, it's, it's more
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the, where I'm actually going is
when you first load a fresh bowl,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, with a vaporizer, uh, you,
we haven't talked about decarbing it yet
[SPEAKER_00]: and decarboxylation doesn't take place
immediately like it does with fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your early polls, um, are going to
evaporate some of the THC a without
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily converting it, um,
to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yes, your first couple of polls are
probably going to feel a little thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe not affect you, but that third,
fourth, fifth, sixth are going to be fully
[SPEAKER_00]: decarbed and, and a lot more intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's so obvious, but I have
never thought of that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I hear that two different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I like it because if my first
hits are going to be offering me more THC
[SPEAKER_02]: a CBGA CBDA, then my ladder hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I'm going to get all these acid
forms of the plant, which are healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: good for me, but the longer it stays in
the vaporization chamber, the heating
[SPEAKER_02]: chamber, the, the cannabinoids will be
changing to the non acid versions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm getting a, perhaps a wider
array of of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for, for, and for the listeners
who are not, um, familiar with decar,
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation, um, essentially what you
need to do to make THC and intoxicant is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to heat it to a certain
point that change it changes it from an
[SPEAKER_02]: acid to a non acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And w and we know when we normally smoke
bowls or, um, smoke joints, there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: much fire in that joint that it happens
instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as Mark was talking about earlier,
we're not, we're not burning at a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about more like a couple
hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that process doesn't happen
instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so then the second thing I'm thinking,
not only am I happy about getting all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these acid forms of the cannabinoids on
the flip side, if I'm dollar conscious,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to really annoy the hell out
of me because I could see that as wasting
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids because if I'm, if I'm money
conscious and I'm trying to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the most bang for my buck,
I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually will be disappointed that I'm
smoking THC a, um, like the first hit or
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really, it really is different,
um, consumer to consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, um, I, I have never
experienced disappointment, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: with flower vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say shango, um, and,
uh, you're through vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when we get into the mechanics
of, of, of different kinds of modes of
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization, um, you know, we can see how
they'll behave differently, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, often unlike with fire, um,
when you're combusting, you've got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of side stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of wastage and with many
vaporizers, um, certainly the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more reputable ones, uh, you're not
heat actually heating the cannabis when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, the, your bowl goes a lot,
lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and from an efficiency standpoint,
you're the over the overall amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you are going to be
purchasing in a month to, uh, manage your
[SPEAKER_00]: health and wellbeing, um, is likely to
drop significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's a much more complex
algorithm that I was giving credit to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also as far as like the wastage goes,
um, it's, it's, uh, it's always noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: how much smaller the heating compartments
are on, uh, vaporizers as they are like
[SPEAKER_02]: from your hand blown glass slide that can
take, you know, a thumb size gram nug in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go over to your vape and it's
asking you to take like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one seventh of that or yeah, one 10th of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then grind it and then put
it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it, it usually looks like a,
a paucity is I think that's the right use
[SPEAKER_02]: of that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like such a small amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then, and then, but then,
you know, still gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you high, but you need to take
more hits and you're getting a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: THC a, but over time you're, you're
wasting less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually budgetary smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to start this first set with,
um, you know, conversations about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the why of it kind of generally,
but, um, no doubt, I know I have invited
[SPEAKER_02]: an engineer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're going to go and take a
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we come back, we're going to
get into a more serious discussion about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the engineering behind, um,
the popular varieties of, of vapes and go
[SPEAKER_02]: through some, uh, oil vaping solutions and
flower vaping solutions and really get
[SPEAKER_02]: into the mechanics of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you are listening to shaping fire
and my guest today is aerospace engineer,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, without these advertisers,
shaping fire wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard me talk about the
award-winning cannabis seeds that come
[SPEAKER_02]: from the analytical breeding program of
Seth and Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the revolution seeds at gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_02]: plants finish in September and not
October, totally upending the photo period
[SPEAKER_02]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles, and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_02]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_02]: GTR seeds has a new THC V line with plants
like double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_02]: one to one THC to two THC V and people
want that THC V.
[SPEAKER_02]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_02]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is only one phenotype in every pack
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_02]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at

something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_02]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_02]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating cannabis.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is aerospace engineer, Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we talked about
why we vape, what the cannabis enthusiast
[SPEAKER_02]: experience is, and some of the challenges
and work throughs for those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to get into more the nitty
gritty of the engineering behind both
[SPEAKER_02]: flower and oil vaporizers now,
both so that you can just be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper on this very important aspect of
the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, this should help provide a bit
of a shopping guide for you as you learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about the different types of vaporizers
and you can figure out what you might be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in should you decide to pick
one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Mark, there's a lot of different
approaches designing vaporizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there are so many coming out on the
market all the time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about flower vapes
first and then vaping oils second because
[SPEAKER_02]: they really are different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about flower vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do flower vapes fall neatly into a few
different categories so that we can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of bunch them up and talk about them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there so much for variability model
to model that we have to take them one by
[SPEAKER_02]: one, God help us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not all vaporizers are created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to flower vaporizers,
there are two primary categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are convection based vaporizers
and conduction based vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, anyone who's stood around a campfire
has also experienced radiant heat before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's heat transfer at a distance,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some vaporizers might include that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is certainly an effect that
impacts sort of the internal working of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: To summarize, just briefly, the
differentiation between the two modes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I'm going to encourage you
to not be necessarily that brief,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't necessarily need to do a
dissertation, but this conduction versus
[SPEAKER_02]: convection thing that I think that you're
about to wade into, this is key,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So take your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we can all pick up on this,
because just the fact that conduction and
[SPEAKER_02]: convection are so similar immediately
confuses people right out of the gates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so take your time, because I think
this is a chunky bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in short, conduction is heat
transfer through touch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a conduction based vaporizer has an
oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a chamber, either made of metal or
ceramic, and you place your herb in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vaporizer heats up that oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your herb is being heated from the
walls of that little oven, of that
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's conduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being heated largely by touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A convection based vaporizer is sort of
like a convection oven or an air fryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're heating up the air, and then that
is being transported or pulled or pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: through your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hot air then extracts or
evaporates the various compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So conduction is actually your flower
touching the heating piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And convection is somewhere up the
chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The air is being heated, and then you're
sucking that hot heat towards the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the heat is touching the flower
instead of the metal or the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hot air is flowing through and
evaporating the volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third kind was radiant,
where there is some kind of device that's
[SPEAKER_02]: itself just hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm putting it in general proximity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's neither touching the flower nor
far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you give us a little bit of
explanation on the conduction-convection
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know that, generally speaking,
people consider one better than the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like you to just kind of
explain the beginning of vaporizer's
[SPEAKER_02]: design, what was first, and then how
they've kind of evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while not everybody likes the same
kind of vaporizers, kind of where the
[SPEAKER_02]: people are responding in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the earliest vaporizers that I'm
aware of are certainly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they played around in the 70s with heat
guns and just delivering the hot air that
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved to some of the whip-based
vaporizers, like the vapor beret.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have my vapor brother's box,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bert there, he's a wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the grandfathers of
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good guy, understands all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were largely convection-based
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were heating the air, and it was
flowing through your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it started to move to more
portable kind of devices, it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to manufacture in small,
you know, compact designs to engineer a
[SPEAKER_00]: conduction-based vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to heat up the oven, throw your herb in
that oven, something on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them, ones like the Pax,
is largely a conduction-based vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how we picture that is that all of
these various vaporizers where it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of little lid, and you put your
flower in there, and it's actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, touching it against steel or
ceramic, and then you're putting the top
[SPEAKER_02]: back on, they all kind of fall in the same
category, no matter what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sizable portion, but there's
others on the market that are hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of the heating of the air,
you know, the crafty, and mighty by Storz
[SPEAKER_00]: and Beckel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, you know, heat the air,
but there's also a conduction component to
[SPEAKER_00]: their design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the heat, you know,
is transmitted up to the walls of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're both introducing hot air,
as well as conduction from the sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to then get an even
vaporization of all the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point for me to not be
overgeneralizing and make it look like
[SPEAKER_02]: these are really such separated solutions
because you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like everybody is inventing and
trying to find the technology blend that
[SPEAKER_02]: works best for their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anybody who's going to buy one,
make sure you understand the one that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not, you know, just something very
general that you, you know, that you read
[SPEAKER_02]: generally about conduction or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say just to to
highlight some of the differences when you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a hot, hot material touching
your herb, you have a danger of burning
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right, because they have to compensate
by delivering a lot more thermal energy
[SPEAKER_00]: through the walls in order to have it then
cook, if you will, the herb that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a much higher likelihood of
over roasting your herb and getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of burnt popcorn taste that some
people complain about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not care for the toasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm a light roast kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to get, you know,
more of an opportunity of the toastiness
[SPEAKER_02]: with conduction, you would not get that
with convection because the heated air is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in contact with your the entirety
of your flower mass at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's it's impacting that the
wherever the inlet side is, it's getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: blast of the heated air, you know,
first that that particular part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: herb is going to get the heat blast first,
but then it's going to be pulled through
[SPEAKER_00]: your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in a convection based vaporizer,
you can also pump up the power so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do, you know, over roast it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're up at combustion level
temperatures for that air, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly combust on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most vaporizers try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you would really need to have your
temp, like really cranked up at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to have it cranked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back to your timeline that
you're giving us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you gave you talked to us about
the box vapes and then the you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first I'll say real break through,
you know, to the consumer market vape of
[SPEAKER_02]: the packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then things continue on to
convention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, please pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think a lot of the things that
you're seeing on the market now are
[SPEAKER_00]: variations of a very similar approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of vaporizers are trying to portray
flexibility through incorporation of
[SPEAKER_00]: different apps, you know, so that you can
control the temperature settings and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can talk about whether or not they can
actually do that or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vaporizers are able to you can set a
particular setting and vary those with an
[SPEAKER_00]: app or directly through the button
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and have that conversation
now, because I was going to ask you that
[SPEAKER_02]: in two questions anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these these temp controls,
and I know we're kind of like talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the entirety of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not really fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, are these temp
controls to be believed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, unless I'm paying a
good penny, you know, for a vape and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting like a, you know,
stores and Bickel or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty I'm pretty suspicious of these
these temperature is that I'm being told
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're heating up for anything that
I'm paying under 200 bucks for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you're right to be
suspicious on that for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some don't actually use a thermal couple,
you know, a sensor that feeds back the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, moreover, I think the biggest
thing is, well, think about a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: oven, you heat it to 350 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as you open the door to put
your cookies in, then it drops
[SPEAKER_00]: considerable amount and the same with a
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon it might heat it to a steady
state, but as soon as you start pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: cool air in, that's going to vary the the
actual temperature of the airflow and the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor that you're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the good side of the temperature
settings that on a particular vaporizer is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you will probably get relative
consistency from one session to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of whether it's actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that can still be a very,
very beneficial kind of attribute to a
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer, so that you can be able to dial
in the experience that you want from one
[SPEAKER_00]: session to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on I buy that I think that makes a
lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so even though on some of the lesser
expensive vapes, the the temps may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate to, you know, the number that
they say it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least it's going to be same from
session to session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you find out, you know,
where you like it, it'll be able to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: that mark consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the grinding part,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, historically, a lot of
people don't grind flour for a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people will grind flour to roll a
joint, though my mentor hated grinders and
[SPEAKER_02]: believed it always had to be done by
scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that was because he was always
collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but when it comes to, you know,
grinding, you know, every book that you
[SPEAKER_02]: get with your vaporizer says to grind the
flour so you get a more even experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really don't like grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true on on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say, yeah, break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you actually grind your herb,
you are changing the particle side and
[SPEAKER_00]: making some uniform consistency in the
when you pack your material into your
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can be very beneficial to get
even flow similar to grinding coffee,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make coffee with whole beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to have to grind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for different coffee makers,
you grind it to different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a similar analog for for flour
vaporizers to grinding will certainly give
[SPEAKER_00]: you that consistency of the of the pack,
if you will, or the puck, as I call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it comes out as a puck once you've
used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really like the what happens
to my trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go chasing after Keefe and
then reintroduce it to the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I prefer actually to chop my my herb
directly in into the chamber or to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop, do you mean like, like finger
separation or scissors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just use fingers to pluck
small, you know, small size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a have a tiny little sharp
knife that that I poke it with and and
[SPEAKER_00]: tease it around and get it to a fairly
uniform consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody has their own kind of
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to keep my trichomes with the
rest of my herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess some of that also depends on
what kind of a grinder you're using,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're not using the Keefe
attachment, it stays with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part about the grinders that I haven't
really cared for is is the smearing of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the trichomes and then like cleaning,
cleaning them off of the grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back back when I was younger,
that seemed like a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it still seems like a lot of
waste, but I have I have plenty of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: now, you know, unlike when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, the the main advantage of the
grind is to get that nice, even pull and
[SPEAKER_02]: to know that I am not wasting the the
trichomes that are on the interior of the
[SPEAKER_02]: little budlets, let's say, that are in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I correct in my assumption that the the
hot air and the conductive walls of the
[SPEAKER_02]: oven, neither of those will vaporize a
trichome that is caught on the interior of
[SPEAKER_02]: a dense bud little piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: The it really depends on the size,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what you're dealing with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that, yes, it's it's more
efficient to to actually grind your herb
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be able to access those internal
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, this is clearly personal
preference, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you you gave good reasons why
you're, you know, on your side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I did as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you and I all both have plenty of
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody else whose decision matrix
might be slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want them to be able to get the
information they need to totally totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know lots of people have opinions who
who I need more than just their opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want to I want to kind of
understand the whole area so I can make my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I tend to do, I mean, again,
this is my personal preference is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you have those small
nuggets, you are correct that the the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal trichomes don't immediately
aren't accessible to to the hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I tend to do is is open the chamber
back up and crush it and then release all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've hit it a couple times and it's
dry, then it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will then fall apart readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got your even distribution
then of particles and it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I was going to ask you was
the recommendation that most of these
[SPEAKER_02]: these companies have to stir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so, you know, usually somewhere
around, I don't know, hit four or five.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say, oh, pop, pop, pop it open and
give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, my God, it just kills me how how
awesome it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so often I see somebody using a pen
with ink on the end to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, you're not even thinking
about what you're putting on your.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's way too common.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, then they then they close it
up and continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, do you think that stirring
is is effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all vaporizers have, you know,
with the airflow going through,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to get even heating of of
your herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stirring it just means you're you're
moving the sort of the unspent particles
[SPEAKER_00]: around, moving the oils around so that
they can be efficiently vaporized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I strongly encourage stirring if you
want to get the most out of your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeling kind of lazy and you've
got a, you know, an abundance of herb
[SPEAKER_00]: available, then, you know, whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeling if you're feeling lazy
or wealthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so at what point would you recommend
the stirring?
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually stir when I when I taste the
toast for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also suspect that I'm I'm I'm one
hit late at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is a personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stir every poll, which is a
pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, every three or four polls,
you know, I've never tried ever every poll
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like so much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I should I should do it for the
experience, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I can weigh all this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would never do it every poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talked on the first set about
how, you know, cloud hits are different
[SPEAKER_02]: with vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet sometimes you do pull clouds and
sometimes you do pull bigger, flavorful
[SPEAKER_02]: hits, even if there is no cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my experience, whatever cloudness
I'm going to get from a vaporizer is
[SPEAKER_02]: improved with stirring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that once you're into
poll two or three, you've you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you you have decarbed, you have warmed the
bowl, you have removed any of the residual
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of moisture in the urban.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just it just becomes the whole
system becomes a lot more efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three or four polls in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you are going to get more,
you know, bigger clouds more easily at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so let's let's move on unless you've
got anything else to say here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to oil vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me talk just briefly about a
couple of couple of other things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we haven't talked about sort
of the exhaust what happens to the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: after it's moved through your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frequently, another thing to look at
in a vaporizer is how much accumulates,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in that vapor pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some some vaporizers on the market,
and I'm not going to call them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, claim for an all glass
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, glass is actually is a fairly
conductive material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this perception that we want to
cool the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once we cool the vapor, you've got
those oils that are then condensing in
[SPEAKER_00]: that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you can tell, you know,
sort of how efficient the vaporizer is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how much gunk you have to clean out and
how often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another sort of buying decision is to
look at, you know, just how much you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens to the vapor after it goes
through the herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having to frequently clean it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then that's not really you're not
getting the maximum benefit from your
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the other sort of
controversies or questions that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there is, is how how much do you pack in
your chamber?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do you press it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you crush it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How dense do you do you pack it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my take on this from a sort of
aeronautic science kind of direction is
[SPEAKER_00]: that for convection based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that are using the hot air for
a convection based vaporizer tamp tamp it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So press it down and compress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to what you do with an
espresso shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're removing any sort of easy channels
for the air to flow past your herb rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And air will always find the path of least
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have those channels and the
larger buds in there, then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flow past rather than through your herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely compress it down and it
creates what's known as back pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is similar to a carb cap on a dab
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers the pressure right there at the
herb and it will vaporize more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad that you went back for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is that interesting, but I do it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I noticed it earlier when you
said, you know, when you take the puck out
[SPEAKER_02]: of your vape, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all like, I'm like, man,
I don't, I don't, I don't have pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, it just comes out as like
slightly brown ground up weeds still,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, and, and in my head,
I wanted to leave a little breathing room
[SPEAKER_02]: so that the hot air could easily be,
be drawn through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I understand from your analysis
that, that I'm doing it exactly wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: because by my leaving it somewhat loose in
there, even though that does make it
[SPEAKER_02]: easier for the stirring, uh, step that,
um, that I am create, I'm allowing easy
[SPEAKER_02]: vapor paths that, that will be preferred
by the physics of the inhalation when
[SPEAKER_02]: really I want to press it down so that
there's all these multitude of variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: paths that are being taken for a
convection based vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for, for a conduction based vaporizer
or like a Dynavap, which is the really
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative design, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically, yeah, they're look like,
I mean, they, they replicate the notion of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a, it's a smoke like
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but there are largely a conduction
based, uh, you know, vaporizer in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that regard, the, the metal heats up
right for, for, for something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the packs, um, which many people have,
I would say a looser pack is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: better because you're heating from the
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the heat then transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really dense, the heat is not
going to be transported through your herb
[SPEAKER_00]: because your herb itself is, has low
conductivity, wood and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't conduct heat very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas then the air that's moving
through there, you want it to circulate
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and the heat to then move into the
center of, of that chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, for a conduction based vaporizer,
I would pack it a little more loosely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting to,
to hit on the Dynavap one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, I, I have owned one and the one I
have, I've only ever used it with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, my butane torch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an interesting experience to
hear the little crack sound and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then know that it's time to take your
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a super big fan of using the
torches in general though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then my buddy, Michael,
you know, he came over and he is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: total Dynavap like fanboy, like he,
well, actually he kind of is just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, he, you know, until,
until I met you, he pretty much knew more
[SPEAKER_02]: than anybody I knew about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and so he got this, uh,
he got this desktop thing that Dynavap has
[SPEAKER_02]: got where it's like you plug it in and you
can just kind of put the pipe into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it acts kind of like,
um, it transfers electric energy to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very convenient, like an email
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then you just take it out
and you hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's so much more elegant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's interesting that it is a
product that has multiple, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: heating mechanisms, because really that's
pretty uncommon to have multiple heating
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms for one vape system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really am impressed with the sort
of the engineering background of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Dynavap and what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's an induction based
heating, um, sort of block that you've,
[SPEAKER_00]: you drop it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it uses induction to then heat,
um, it up to the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I think that's pretty fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ready to move on to oil now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so as kind of like a bridge place,
let's just give a little bit of a shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to those flower vaporizers who really,
really want to be oil vaporizers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, you know, they will,
they will have like little solutions like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, oh, I've got, I've got a
little cup and you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you can take your oil and put it in
the cup and then drop it into the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: chamber or, um, or, or, you know,
we've, we've got this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: specialty screen or a sponge and put your
oil in that, and then we'll put it into
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, those can,
um, people can definitely find
[SPEAKER_02]: effectiveness with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that across the board,
it's really hard to make one vaporizer
[SPEAKER_02]: that's best for all solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and like, if you only, if you're only
going to buy one and you need one that
[SPEAKER_02]: does both, that's the, like, there are
definitely some good solutions out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, you know, going all the way back
to the, the, the original packs like
[SPEAKER_02]: little cup that was in there, you know,
I, I got mine assuming that it was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be an oil vape and a flower of vape,
but that little, that, that little cup
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it didn't really work out over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really work, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what are, what are your thoughts
on, on these vapes that try to straddle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that when it comes to
vaporization, um, of an oil, it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about trying to maximize your surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're dealing with flower,
it's great because the flower fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, wick the oils and distribute them
across the, across the fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way of experiencing oils or
concentrates would be to just drop it on
[SPEAKER_00]: or mix it in with your, with your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be a pretty effective way of
using, uh, the flower vaporizers to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got to mix and you're not
getting that purity, um, that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who dab are seeking, um,
from, from their extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, um, just, I'm going to do a
little bit on the, because I spent a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years trying to find a solution
to this with oils and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers, the flower vaporizers in the
market use a stainless steel kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Brillo pad, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, it's just a bunch of stainless
steel wire that's been compressed into a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, you know, shaped puck or disc that
then gets dropped into the, the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the challenge with that is that,
uh, metal will warm up and not reach,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the vaporization temperatures very
readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's warming up your thick oil
or, or concentrate your wax or shatter is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start melting and it's going to
travel along that, uh, along those wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes before you reach the
vaporization temperatures, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start flowing into the rest of your unit
and you're getting to get that gunk
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so no, most, most, uh, that try to do
both are, are not very effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us have had that experience
early in our token career where,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, we try to put, you know, a ball of
bubble hash or something into our bong
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, with a screen and, and we're
warming it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we're warming it up, we're seeing
it like slide down the slide on the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, you're like, I only got
one hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's all like, now it's all,
yeah, it's all inside of the bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's exactly what's happening
inside the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up having to clean it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody likes doing dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk more about like oil vaping
solutions that are specifically for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really isn't going to be a long show
on carts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but let's do talk about just,
um, the idea behind the carts and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, but carts could be like their own
show, you know, so, so if you would just
[SPEAKER_02]: explain the mechanics of carts,
um, that'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically you have, uh,
carts are very interesting and efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're very convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the oil basically is, uh, you know,
is in the cartridge and then there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: heating element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oftentimes there's a wick or a wicking
mechanism to make sure that the oil gets
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to the, to that heating
element, um, or to a hot ceramic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that then, uh, locally basically boils
the oil, um, locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that then, uh, that vapor then is
transmitted and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the mouthpiece and aerosolized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one thing I learned recently is that,
uh, part of the design of, of many
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges is actually to introduce,
uh, an external, they have little air
[SPEAKER_00]: holes and that is to make sure that the
vapor is less dense, um, and that it
[SPEAKER_00]: coalesces back into an aerosol rather than
staying in fine particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particulate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was always, that fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is to increase sort of the
cloud production, but also to make it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little easier on your lungs and to cool it
a little bit before it enters your lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, as, as far, you know,
we're really going to focus on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on non cart vapes, but, but since we're
right here, I think that it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: for us to say, you know, whatever your
preferences in, you know, what you want in
[SPEAKER_02]: your vape, like, you know, I'm a big fan
of hash rosin personally, but I certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: have got respected friends who like
properly purged BHO for flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's, there's,
there's a wide range of, of what you can
[SPEAKER_02]: put in the vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I want to be clear on is to
know your source because there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage that can be put in the vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and it was weird in the early
days, people didn't really know what was
[SPEAKER_02]: best to put in the vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people tried everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: From, you know, uh, coconut oil to
vegetable glycerin, all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and God help us, we made it
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and so now we know mostly we
don't want to be, you know, adding non
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then the ones in the, in the
licensed market are often so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: For lots of people that, that they tend to
buy them cheaper in the unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, then we're back to the problem
of, Oh God, what the hell's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, you know, whatever,
whatever your oil preference, dear
[SPEAKER_02]: listener, um, you know, no, no,
your source because we want, we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: you to get, you know, some kind of serious
lung issue from, uh, from using some
[SPEAKER_02]: sketchy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and to, for, from a functionality
perspective, you have to have something
[SPEAKER_00]: added to the cannabis oil or it won't flow
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, uh, a degree of,
uh, of flow that, that enters into the
[SPEAKER_00]: design and requires something to kind of
cut or thin, um, the oil to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that always the case though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I really thought that the,
that like the, the big breakthrough in the
[SPEAKER_02]: last like 18 months is people being able
to press hash rosin at a viscosity,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that they can put them in these,
these new vapes and not have to have any
[SPEAKER_02]: adulterant at all to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that not accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I don't know, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen those designs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's exciting if it is,
um, one of the cautions that I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: for people with, uh, the cartridge based
vaporizers, because at least I experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: this, um, and that is that throat burn,
um, that often happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's easy to think that that's
temperature, but I don't believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's really happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anytime that you drop, let's say,
uh, if you've done Chinese cooking or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or dropped, you know, hot oil onto or oil
onto a really hot pan that's like red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you get, um, a lot of, you convert
those oils fairly rapidly into other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are thicker and are,
uh, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become bad shit, you know,
is, is really what happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime you're, uh, really putting the
oil in the presence of something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: super hot, um, it's going to alter the
chemical structures of those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I believe, uh,
the throat burn is due to, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least that's my, my, my armchair
science background on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, damn, if that's true,
uh, that, that explains why so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: have turned away from cartridges and gone
to some of these other solutions,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, like the Puffco peak, which we're
going to talk about in a second,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but before we get into that,
before we do, um, so w do you consider an
[SPEAKER_02]: email vaping or combustion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's a, it's a form of
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering if it had to do with
like the temp, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly we, we do, we do, we do see
smoke from it, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, but we don't ever see fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I was kind of of this idea
myself, cause I've used an email for years
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that at my lower temperatures as a
vaporizer, but at higher temperatures,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's combustion, but that might be like
the most non-science thing I've said
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're experiencing again,
you can alter the chemical composition
[SPEAKER_00]: without it being combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at high temperatures, when you pass the
smoke point of an oil, you start altering
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical composition and that can feel
like combustion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a, it's a harsher effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when your nail is, is super hot,
um, uh, largely it will lead to that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of movement to the,
to the cold start dabbing or low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and emails have certainly helped that,
uh, quite a bit, um, to, to dial in the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures more precisely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, so we're going to next,
let's talk about the, the, the puff co
[SPEAKER_02]: peak, which, um, you know, stands out as
being, you know, one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: cherished, uh, instruments, um,
you know, in the oil community,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's, it's, uh, it's convenience
and, and the fact that you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you were talking about the, um,
Oh, surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the great things is they,
they've got the, you know, their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their bowls are great and they're pretty
evenly heated throughout it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've got a lot of space at once
that's in contact with the oil at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, I guess I'll want to
be clear that, you know, puff goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: not like a sponsor or anything,
you know, other people like the focus,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Carta, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm talking more about the design
where it looks like a bong and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you've got this, this wide bowl and,
and then it's heated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you put your concentrate on
there, um, you're, you're going to get a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a large vapor hit at once because of all
the surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you, do you like how I'm explaining
the science behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that how you see it too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had a ton of experience with
the puff coat, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sexy AF, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is, it is, you know,
let's face it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it, uh, hits all the right,
uh, notes, I think for, for being a
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic product and, um, you know,
and it, and it can really deliver for
[SPEAKER_00]: those people who want that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's pretty revolutionary from an
email perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they got a lot of crap over
in the early years because there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were some models that went out with
some, you know, failing components,
[SPEAKER_02]: which they've like, I guess they figured
it out over the years because I haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: heard people completely compare,
uh, complain about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, have you ever seen the,
the, the, the specialty puffco peak,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, hand blown and, and made glass
trophies that they use for Emerald cup the
[SPEAKER_02]: last few years since they started
sponsoring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, I wish I could plug the artist who
does such a great job on them or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: they change them from year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, if, uh, you know, for those
who, those who like puffco's and they also
[SPEAKER_02]: like ostentatious pieces, you know,
you know, uh, search for the, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald cup, um, I've seen some great wood
ones online where people are making some
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous wood pipes that, uh, that then
the Carta fits in and yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have that smoking like
experience, but then enjoy your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this whole family of, uh, of pipes like
the puffco peak and the Carta,
[SPEAKER_02]: these all would fall into the conduction
category, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, um, that, that ceramic bowl
that's being heated and then we're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: our dab oil on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a direct application of heat,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you have any, do you have anything
else to say about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, that type of design before we
move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that, well, I always have
something to say, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish us off on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, again, look at, at the waste
product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's left in, in the bowl when you're
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that can tell you a little bit
about clues to the, to the chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening, um, during the process
of vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're left with, you know,
dark, uh, resiny, um, substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, then you've, you haven't completely,
uh, vaporized them and you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: altered the chemistry, just like when,
uh, in a cartridge that's near the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: life, the oil has changed from a,
maybe a light honey, um, to a really
[SPEAKER_00]: darker, uh, blend because you've altered
the oils, um, and you're left with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that heavier kind of, uh, content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compounds in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting how what is left,
um, depending on what is left,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, can say something about your
temperature choice, but it can also say
[SPEAKER_02]: something about what's in the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so other, other than the, the under
combusted dark oil that you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, what, what else might we find in
remaining in the bowl that we would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, you're not having any plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you've got are, are largely just
different oil compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you, uh, when the changes happen
to terpenes, uh, and Dr. Strongin from
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland state university has done some
interesting research on, on dabs and sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the byproducts of, of conventional
dabbing techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't apply to low temperature
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but for high temperature dabs,
um, there's, uh, you know, a, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great word pyrolytic, but literally means
fire changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and thermolytic is probably the more
accurate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, the, the oils then break down into
those benzene rings and these other,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, hydrocarbons that have been
shown to be present in, in, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cigarette smokes and be,
uh, you know, cancer causing compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying that that's what is in
there, but there is a likelihood of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of finding those kinds of, of compounds in
that remaining goo goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to think of the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really, um, good encouragement
for us that when we do get a new vaporizer
[SPEAKER_02]: to, um, really spend some time getting to
know, um, the different temperature points
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can, you know, really find the
right temperature for how we like to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we're, we're not having that much,
much, um, you know, uh, residue and that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not tempted to smoke it once it's
become gunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it, we want to heat it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we get to inhale it pre gunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, for anybody making a smoke,
a selection of a, of a vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really comes down to your preferences,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, how much do you value the
discreteness?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time and a place, you know,
for a, for a vape pen that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing else is going to, to actually fill
that need, um, for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then how much of an enthusiast are
you, are you concerned about preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for the full kind of a
more relaxed ritualized experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: which some of those will give you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or are you looking for something
that's a little faster and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually, I don't know about you,
but I really don't want to interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone to then control my control,
my vaporizer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, interact with my phone enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really does take you out of,
it does take you out of being present,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I also have to cop to the fact that
I've never done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to having that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much is the technology,
um, enhancing your experience or is your
[SPEAKER_00]: technology getting in the way of your
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it becoming part of the focus of
your experience or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, an ideal product kind of fades into
the background and you don't have to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, let's bring an end to this,
uh, rather long set and go to our
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and let me make sure you, that you
come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he, cause if that was a long set for
you, you might be like thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: taking off, but don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're talking about something really
important on the third set.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking about boiling point myths
and the difference between evaporation
[SPEAKER_02]: versus boiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you come back from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you are listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is aerospace engineer Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you've caught up on the latest
shaping fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got you shaping fire has a
fabulous YouTube channel with content not
[SPEAKER_02]: found on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_02]: Sigmund's lecture, understanding your
endocannabinoid system, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderland nursery, talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy cannolis lost art of the hashish
in presentation, Nicholas Mahmood on
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative and poly culture cannabis
growing Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
solventless extraction and Jeff Lohenfels
[SPEAKER_02]: on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_02]: While there be sure to check out the three
10 part shaping fire session series,
[SPEAKER_02]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lohenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis

[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shaping fire Instagram has followup
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_02]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_02]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage you to follow at shaping
fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_02]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is aerospace engineer, Mark Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the big finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the first set, we talked about why
we vape and what the customer experiences,
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumer experiences, and why so many
people are attracted to vaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the second set, we went in depth
into the vaporizer technologies as they
[SPEAKER_02]: are right now and a whole bunch of
strategies for getting a vape in your
[SPEAKER_02]: hands that fits your smoking preferences
because they really are a personal device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here in set three, we're gonna
finish up with a discussion of evaporation
[SPEAKER_02]: versus boiling because if the primary
physics that we wanna have happen is the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and terpenes and the rest of
the resin components to be vaporized and
[SPEAKER_02]: then inhaled into our lungs, it really
does matter what their volatility is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What their volatility levels are and
whether we're evaporating or boiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our scene on Instagram or on
Reddit, it's very common to see these
[SPEAKER_02]: little charts that show all of the
volatility points for different terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel like that empowers us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mark, you've written this great blog
on your website that explains how that
[SPEAKER_02]: belief is not quite right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are using that information
and the thermostats on our vaporizers in
[SPEAKER_02]: ways that aren't maybe getting the results
that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess let's slide into this by
talking about these charts that exist and
[SPEAKER_02]: what their limitations are that you see as
an engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Django.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated by these boiling point
charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first saw them, I was like,
oh, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, these vaporizers are saying that I
can dial in a particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I dial it to 349 degrees Fahrenheit,
I will get limonene because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling point of limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bottom line of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you look deeper into it, those may be
the boiling points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boiling points are notoriously difficult
to actually measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's boiling ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most scientists use boiling ranges rather
than a particular boiling point because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pressure dependent and there's other
aspects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the purity of the sample and all
of these other things that lead to boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: or not boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not as relevant as the other
aspects here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about the charts is that
it gives you some relative volatility of
[SPEAKER_00]: the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by volatility, how easy is it to go
from a liquid to a vapor?
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's super volatile at room
temperature will evaporate really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of rubbing alcohol, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty volatile compound,
whereas water is not a very volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit more work to get
those molecules into their gaseous form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those boiling point charts are great to
understand some relative volatility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't tell the entire story,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do they have any value to us as people
who are consuming cannabis with
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_02]: If there might be some, maybe not
inaccuracies in them, but some contextual
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are missing, can they be
useful to us at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could we use them to our benefit or is
it just not useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, they are useful in understanding
the relative nature of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've got in cannabis is this
wonderful bouquet of different aromatics
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavonoids and cannabinoids that are
in this mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helpful to maybe think about it
as a perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that perfume, there's these top
notes that are lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the citrusy notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about that in terms of a
perfume, there's your top notes,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mid notes, and your base notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you put on your cologne or your
perfume, right away, you're getting those
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier notes as part of the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more dominant, but you're still
getting the base notes and those smells as
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfume evaporates off of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mixture later on, an hour later,
is going to maybe be less on the top notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and more dominant with the mid notes,
but your base notes are still there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on into the evening,
a lot of your top notes have all
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mid notes, there's less of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your base notes then are the dominant
smell that you will smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, that happens more rapidly
with vaporization, particularly flower
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization, is that you are,
for a particular power setting on your
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer, you are going to get a
different mixture of those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your second pole will be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your third pole will be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fourth pole will be more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout your session with a
particular bowl, you're going to be left
[SPEAKER_00]: then at the end with some of the heavier,
more difficult to volatize compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'll still be present.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that sounds fun, but also
frustrating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want all of it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my mind suggests that the way that I
would get them all at the same time is if
[SPEAKER_02]: I am using a really hot setting,
which would then also give me a satisfying
[SPEAKER_02]: cloud, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm doing is I'm wrecking
probably the more volatile ones in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the more base ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though in my head I'm thinking,
oh, if I scorch it at this higher
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, I'll get all the good stuff
at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't really how it plays out,
is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you crank up the heat,
you're going to volatize more rapidly,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your lighter compounds are going to
evaporate more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be on a compressed time
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the benefits of those who choose to
do low temperature vaporization is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads out that extraction, if you will,
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're able to taste and experience
the subtleties, you know, in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're using a hot setting,
if I have a medical condition that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: treating and I need that rapid onset,
then by all means, crank it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be the temperature you would
recommend if somebody's goal is to get as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as they can out of it, tasting
uniform in just a hit or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I would, you know,
personally, I'm personally, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend her personally, I wouldn't
recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get a lot more out of your
cannabis through a lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out there, Shango, when I first
started exploring vaporization and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to, you know, ratchet it up to that
pre combustion point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I had that heavy roast,
I felt, you know, got the feedback that
[SPEAKER_00]: was more familiar to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I, you know, over the last
couple of years, I consistently start
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing it back farther and farther and
farther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it extends my session a little bit,
but my enjoyment level goes way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't approach with the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a point in your bowl where you
start to experience a bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I cash out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're up in that pre combustion,
combustion zone, where you're at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, temperatures around 400 or
greater, you're going to get to that bite
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, then I'm wasting product
because I didn't experience all of the joy
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rest of the compounds were
offering me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that speaks to a really
important point and can probably be like a
[SPEAKER_02]: theme for the show, which is part of
choosing to use a vaporizer for your
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption involves having a different
experience than combustion because
[SPEAKER_02]: vaporizing is never going to be
combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of becoming a regular
vaporizer is learning to smoke in new
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, you know, people who are fans
of the cold start where you warm up the
[SPEAKER_02]: tool already loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dab oil slowly increases and
you're taking hits as it's warming up,
[SPEAKER_02]: working its way all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your sesh has significantly expanded in
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, every hit that you take is going
to be different, but that evolution of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hits is itself a different experience and
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experience a connoisseurs experience that
you that you don't get with with a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's slowing it down a little
bit, which I think we've lost a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in in our cannabis consumption,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the foreplay in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we don't do shots of alcohol
anymore after college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's it's more like sipping a
fine cocktail or a whiskey rather than,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, slamming it back and not just
going after the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no judgment, because, you know,
that was a large part of my life for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we've talked about throughout the
show, this whole show is about personal
[SPEAKER_02]: preference, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not trying to judge anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just be open minded to experiencing
cannabis differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what vaporization
offers you is this, you know, a really
[SPEAKER_00]: different way to enjoy really high quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm blessed and you're blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others out there are blessed to live
in places where they have really
[SPEAKER_00]: conscientious cultivators who are creating
these amazing turp rich varietals that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think deserve to be experienced in their
fullest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, flower vaporization is a way
for for me to taste and experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity that the plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the high is different than than
composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that, you know, that's a really
great ending to the show there,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was going to ask you if there
are any more boiling point myths that you
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to point out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I am because I don't you may you
may have something else that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring to the table before we wrap up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other boiling point myths
that you want to bring up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, the only real thing is,
is that the mechanism is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling, which is internal to a fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's better to think about it as
evaporation and just a rapid evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than than a boiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so the charts that point out the
boiling point, they may be scientifically
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but really, because evaporation starts
before boiling, we're back to you pointing
[SPEAKER_02]: out that it really is more of a range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a range that every time we take
a hit, we're going to cool the the heating
[SPEAKER_02]: element to some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're just going to be whatever
temperature we we pick, we're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to be kind of cycling up and
down in that general neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some devices warm up faster and
compensate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but largely, yeah, you're doing that
kind of cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back and forth, the boiling points,
again, give you the relative how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to experience that bowl,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mark, thank you so much for being a
guest on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been a fan of vaporizers
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I've never actually
studied them very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and as I said in the introduction,
you know, when I met you, you had the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual scientific answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had the answers for for the
questions that I had had for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and it was funny because, you know,
well, our first phone call was over an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I was like, so excited to hear you
cross applying all this vaporization,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these vaporization questions I had to
to, you know, aeronautical aeronautical
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering and rocket science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, I have finally found my
person for for the vaping show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I really appreciate you,
you know, coming over and hanging out with
[SPEAKER_02]: us on shaping fire for a little while and
and sharing your expertise and also,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of taking it out of the
heady super science vocabulary that you
[SPEAKER_02]: and I used on our first phone call and and
kind of put it in layman's terms terms
[SPEAKER_02]: today so that we could do a show that
would be open to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I appreciate your knowledge and your
ability to make that knowledge accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: to all sorts of different kind of cannabis
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for all that you have done
over the years to really educate consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: about this wonderful plant and and other
plants that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It you've been a part of my own
educational journey and your guests have
[SPEAKER_00]: been part of that journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to do a shout out to all
of those people in the cannabis space who
[SPEAKER_00]: are helping to educate others and to
demythify this industry, because the more
[SPEAKER_00]: we can demythify it, the more we can move
beyond the stigma and and start really
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrating what the plant has to offer
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, dear listener, if you want to
learn more from Mark, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: that you check out his website,
where he has got a handful of blog entries
[SPEAKER_02]: that are very interesting with all sorts
of charts and graphs, including the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that we did this last set primarily
focused on, on boiling point myths,
[SPEAKER_02]: which goes into far more detail than we
did here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find the blog section at his
website, which is pearl labs.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's spelled specially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's P r r l l a b s.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a cat pearl labs.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you will find his blog and and
also the vaporizers that he has engineered
[SPEAKER_02]: himself with all of this insight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a big fan of the the Neo that I
talked about in the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the very least, go check it out
because a a vaporizer that will functions
[SPEAKER_02]: like a like a handheld lighter is a pretty
cool thing to see.
