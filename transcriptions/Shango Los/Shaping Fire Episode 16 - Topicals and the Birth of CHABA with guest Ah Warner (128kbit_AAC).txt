[SPEAKER_01]: It's true that cannabis is a harder road
for entrepreneurs than most.
[SPEAKER_01]: All entrepreneurs need vision to raise
money, find help, and deliver their
[SPEAKER_01]: product or service while turning a profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If only cannabis was that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis entrepreneurs also must find a
bank that accepts cannabis clients,
[SPEAKER_01]: a location that will rent to them,
and find suppliers who may themselves be
[SPEAKER_01]: unsure about working with cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes, an entrepreneur needs to
create a law that will even allow their
[SPEAKER_01]: business to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today, Ah Warner, is this sort of
entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoy hearing frank discussions

[SPEAKER_01]: business, and technique, I encourage you

[SPEAKER_01]: Social media sites are becoming very
unreliable and showing folks every post
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to see, so sign up for the
newsletter to make sure you don't miss an
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah Warner's extraordinary efforts as a
citizen lobbyist created the country's
[SPEAKER_01]: first cannabis health and beauty aids law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acronym for that law you'll hear a lot
today is CHABA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Washington law removed cannabis
health and beauty aids from the state's
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those products can now be sold in any
store like food co-ops, massage suppliers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even big chains like Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way back in 1995, Ah Warner
founded Cannabis Basics in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: where she's still presently CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Basics has two lines of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first line is based on the healing
properties of hemp seed oil and are
[SPEAKER_01]: available throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second, available only in Washington,
are based on whole plant cannabis with
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The astonishing thing though is that they
have THC and yet can be sold anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah received the 1999 Hemp Times Bioneer
Award for Outstanding Achievement in Body
[SPEAKER_01]: Care and the MJBA Women's Alliance Special
Award for her focus and dedication to the
[SPEAKER_01]: women in Washington's cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah is also founder and executive director
of the International Cannabis Health and
[SPEAKER_01]: Beauty Aids Producers Alliance,
which spells out the wonderful name of
[SPEAKER_01]: Ichabapah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah has been a cannabis activist for
decades and now finds herself at the helm
[SPEAKER_01]: of one of the most important and visionary
cannabis companies in the country while
[SPEAKER_01]: inspiring people in other states to figure
out how they can create ichabalas where
[SPEAKER_01]: they live like Ah has done in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're gonna talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show Ah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very glad you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know during the 2016 Washington
State Legislative Session, you
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully lobbied for a new state law
that would allow full plant cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: extract health and beauty products with a
THC content of less than 0.3% to be sold
[SPEAKER_01]: in regular unlicensed stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know this was a big deal because
this kind of law exists nowhere else in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a little bit about this law and
what it took to get passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually um so that's all true
except that it was 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so we introduced the the
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Jeannie Colwell, Senator Jeannie
Colwell was my champion in the Senate and
[SPEAKER_00]: we introduced that language in January
22nd of 2015 and it was passed ah signed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Hensley on June 30th and enacted on
July 1st of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been over a year and a half now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how time flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is um some legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is law that doesn't exist in any
other state in the union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and so we're leading the way for
cannabis health and beauty aids and so
[SPEAKER_00]: products less than 0.3% THC, non
intoxicating and topical applications only
[SPEAKER_00]: are available to be sold on the mainstream
marketplace here in Washington state only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's profound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so um I want to drill into this just a
little bit more because I'm sure a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like well we've got cannabis
laws in our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't they the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is what makes this particular um law
unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well uh it basically it defines so that I
see three divisions of cannabis topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is hemp body care.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is cannabis health and beauty aids in
the middle and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one would be
recreational slash medical topicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are sold in a regular in a highly
regulated market like our 502 market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are uh Chaba is the only place
that Chaba actually exists is here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and so what we did was we defined it
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defined it as not marijuana and we were
able to get it removed out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state controlled substances act
which was um a big deal and it means a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: for other states because it was we were
the first state to remove anything
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis out of any state's controlled
substances act and I believe it to be true
[SPEAKER_00]: that now industrial hemp hasn't even been
removed out of any state's controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substances act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first chipping away of the
block of a state CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a lot to be proud of and you
know since so much of us are throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: around this this sub 0.3 percent uh as it
as it applies to the CBD from hemp work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important that we take a
moment and clarify for folks that that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that same 0.3 percent number but
we're talking about authentic cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants not industrial hemp and the key
point is the percentage of THC in the
[SPEAKER_01]: final product that goes on the shelf which
must stay below 0.3 percent right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely yeah and so I use that hemp
level because I knew that that was the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that was everyone was comfortable with in
the United States that less than 0.3
[SPEAKER_00]: percent THC I used that when we were
writing the language but but just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's less than 0.3 percent THC as a
finished product it doesn't make it hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Chaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is a plant a cannabis plant that's
less than 0.3 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very different definitions but
we absolutely use the same number and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to make sure that people
understand you know when you say less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3 percent THC in a finished product so
I'm talking about a cream or an ointment
[SPEAKER_00]: or a lotion you're actually talking about
85 less than 85 milligrams of THC in a
[SPEAKER_00]: finished one ounce product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think oh less than 0.3 percent
THC it's nothing well actually it is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit 80 80 less than 85 milligrams is
quite a bit in a one ounce container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah absolutely and so you're right when
saying 0.3 percent it sounds like an
[SPEAKER_01]: insignificant number but when you when you
switch over to milligrams you're like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in an ounce that makes a lot of
sense as far as you know relief goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at active ingredients in
like an arnica cream you're talking the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredients like five milligrams
seven milligrams you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really low when you're talking
active ingredients in in health in you
[SPEAKER_00]: know topical therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find that you you really had a lot
of challenge with legislators who just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to touch the cannabis topic at
all you know was it was it difficult for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to kind of have them understand to
tease out the difference between you know
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabis policy and cannabis policy
as it applies to health and beauty aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I have to say you know I was very
very you know this is 2015 so medical was
[SPEAKER_00]: being shut down I mean we've had this
tumultuous transition it's been very
[SPEAKER_00]: painful but I have I really was conscious
of the fact that I needed to keep Chaba
[SPEAKER_00]: separate from medical marijuana and Chaba
separate from recreational adult adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and so I was conscious of that
fact and I the the legislators in Olympia
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pretty savvy they did I didn't
have a whole lot of opposition and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually you know there was only one when
my son and I lobbied Olympia and took our
[SPEAKER_00]: two of our products to every office in
Olympia there was only one office that
[SPEAKER_00]: refused to take it and so everybody was
pretty happy and you can you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed that Olympia was talking about
cannabis topicals and cannabis basics for
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know three weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no they were very receptive is the
short answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on and you know while we're on that
you know I have heard you talk to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different folks about you know how to
approach policymakers and so as an aside
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't you just take a moment and give
folks your general primer because so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people get are so emotional about wanting
to liberate cannabis for for patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: for rec that sometimes they they go and
they interact with their politicians as if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the enemy and I think that
everybody can learn something from you
[SPEAKER_01]: about how you approached them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's about perspective and so in the
cannabis culture in the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a different perspective but you
have to understand in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: anything happen to change you know to
liberate cannabis we have to work from
[SPEAKER_00]: their perspective so when you go first of
all reach out to your legislators
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators but always be professional
always you know please and thank you and
[SPEAKER_00]: always look professional when you're down
there because remember they're not walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into your community you're walking into
theirs so it's really important that you
[SPEAKER_00]: be yourself because that's what speaks to
them but you but you must present yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: like you you are down there lobbying every
time you walk into a legislators office
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually lobbying for a cause so
present yourself be serious and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and if they're trying to make jokes you
know because it is weed you know just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it you know be light-hearted about it but
remember say this is really isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing matter anymore we really need to
work on this and get through you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: fear and the you know the laughable part
of this but for me specifically what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was was I just happened to have the
champion Washington State champion Jeanne
[SPEAKER_00]: Cole Wells who's now King County
Councilwoman Cole Wells she happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the senator for my legislative district
the 36th district in in Washington State
[SPEAKER_00]: and so she was the perfect person I got an
introduction to her I had a meeting with
[SPEAKER_00]: her and from get she was just like oh
these are amazing this doesn't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: sense why they would be regulated so
heavily blah blah blah you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean she she was all in from the beginning
within six months we had legislation we
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced it and six months later it was
passed so what you think is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: super super daunting thing can sometimes
be fairly easy it's all about putting one
[SPEAKER_00]: foot front of the other and being clear
about what you're asking for so after you
[SPEAKER_01]: got this new never been seen before Chavo
law passed I'm assuming that you had to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on a serious education campaign with
retailers just like you had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators because they must have been a
little astonished that they could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: even carry your product yeah and just like
I had to do to retailers back in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: for hemp and just like I had to do in the
mid 2000 or in the early 2012 2013 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical world for topicals I mean it's
been one education after another but
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers now you know the irony and I
definitely want to make this point is that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana being legalized has brought
attention to my whole company my hemp line
[SPEAKER_00]: and my Chavo line and retailers are much
more savvy now than they were even two
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago you know it's hip cannabis is
now acceptable so when they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't even talk to you before at least
they're having a conversation now that
[SPEAKER_00]: being said I have had some bigger buyers
in Washington state say oh we're just not
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for this we're just not willing to
take the risk even though I can refer them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the RCW that shows them that it's
absolutely legal for them to tell to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: these products in their store some of them
are still apprehensive that being said we
[SPEAKER_00]: are making progress you know I lost 125
medical marijuana stores on July 15th of
[SPEAKER_00]: this year I'm sorry of 2016 so I lost my
entire medical marketplace and now I'm up
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 55 mainstream stores so we're
talking grocery stores and spas and coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops and chiropractic doctors
naturopathic doctors this is the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer that I have now and they're far more
savvy than I you know I would even say
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the medical buyers that I was
dealing with two years ago and now I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have because I'm in the
mainstream I have the opportunity to have
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and so now I now have the
first distribution deal for Chavo product
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in Washington state and so now I
have someone else reaching out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger buyers on my behalf and so it's
going to streamline this and make this
[SPEAKER_00]: happen much more quickly but buyers are
much more savvy these days I can imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: the on your behalf part can be challenging
because as you are selling to the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: level buyers they in turn need to explain
what's going on to the end user and our
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers buying the products do they get
it the consumers get it and I have to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you in most cases you know every time I
speak and I do a fair amount of speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: the last thing that I say is the best
thing that you could do for Chava and for
[SPEAKER_00]: liberating all of cannabis is to talk to
your local retailer your corner store
[SPEAKER_00]: where you go in to get your milk ask them
do they carry any Chava and of course this
[SPEAKER_00]: is only Washington state for now but ask
them do you have any Chava do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis health and beauty aids and if
they don't say well I would encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to look into it it's now legal for you to
sell it and so it's it's consumers and its
[SPEAKER_00]: patients also going to their doctors and
asking their chiropractors it's safe for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to use this it's really working for me
so it is kind of a groundswell of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers asking the retailers and asking
their care providers to carry these
[SPEAKER_01]: products I'm excited I'm excited to talk
to you about how this is a model for other
[SPEAKER_01]: states but first we're going to take a
short break and be right back you're

week's newsletter welcome back this is
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire and i am your host shango
lows today's guest is ah warner founder of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis basics so in the first set we
were talking about how ah got the first in
[SPEAKER_01]: the nation chabba law passed and now we
understand that that she's also working on
[SPEAKER_01]: a new law that will give chabba companies
the privilege to buy raw inputs cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs from state licensed recreational
cannabis producers that follow-up will
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much remake the health and beauty
aids market how is that new law gonna work
[SPEAKER_00]: ah well let me just set the premise of why
it's necessary on of course on july 15th
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2016 not only did i lose my medical
retail marketplace my buyers but i also
[SPEAKER_00]: lost the collective garden model system
which is what medical worked under here as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as growers were concerned so i i lost
my sourcing as well so i lost my way to
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire cannabinoids because i don't grow
i'm not a i'm not a marijuana grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: so what we really need is a way as we need
an we needed an accessibility event to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work with five oh two producers
and so that's what we're working on now we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a piece of legislation uh in both the
house and the senate right now that is on
[SPEAKER_00]: pause until next year for um for reasons
that we just thought the climate wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite ready for considering the new
president and um and the federal climate
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all i'll say about that uh so but
when it goes next session in january we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be moving forward with a piece of
legislation that will allow me to source
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow chabba permitted manufacturers
and they will be permitted through the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor and cannabis board they'll have a
permit that will allow them to take
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids out of the five oh two system
and make their products as long as the
[SPEAKER_00]: products finish is less than point three
percent thc so to allow for the handling
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabinoids so the the the kind of
impact of all this fantastic work that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been doing and and kind of where i
want to go with the show today is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing this you know nationally
breakthrough work here in washington but
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as you know the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: as a whole um this can become a model and
so you know how are these two laws a model
[SPEAKER_01]: for similar work that could be done by
other entrepreneur activists in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states yeah i i love that um so so my
number one goal is to get the hands that
[SPEAKER_00]: get these types of products in the hands
back in the hands of all health conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers remember the products that i
make were they were fairly commonplace 150
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago so let's we didn't read we
didn't invent anything we just defined it
[SPEAKER_00]: here with our law and so um but as far as
other states using what we've done here in
[SPEAKER_00]: washington state i think that it would be
fairly easy for them to do they could just
[SPEAKER_00]: look at their controlled substances act
and figure out a way to define these tops
[SPEAKER_00]: of products and remove it out of their own
states controlled substances act but they
[SPEAKER_00]: also have to figure out a way for them to
work with their own medical or adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated system i mean you gotta remember
some states don't have either yeah so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna really depend on what is exactly
happening in that state i've had people
[SPEAKER_00]: from colorado and california both reach
out to me and ask me to do what we did you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in their states what we did here in
washington and it's not it's easier said
[SPEAKER_00]: than done because you have to look at the
laws that are in place in in those states
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tweak it from there so um but i
encourage anybody that wants to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at that to make that happen because
it will be state by state by state unless
[SPEAKER_00]: of course they just federally do schedule
marijuana all together um but yeah it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting but you know that being said i am
proud of the fact that uh washington state
[SPEAKER_00]: will be known as the birthplace and
epicenter of cannabis modern-day cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: health and beauty aids so one of the
things that i know just from being friends
[SPEAKER_01]: with you is that um you are a you're
you're constantly working uh you are you
[SPEAKER_01]: love doing strategic alliances with other
good people and and you've got you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: this work ethic which is just you know
intense it's very intense and and and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know i know that there are other folks
that are listening and are understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're putting down about cannabis
health and beauty aids and you're like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know i might be able to do in in my state
what i did in washington what piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice or what would you say to them if
they came up to you at a convention and
[SPEAKER_01]: said you know i want to do this in you
know in another state what what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice do you give to those folks so are
you asking whether they for them to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the law for them to start making products
like these let's say let's say well
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the the changing the law i'm
thinking of the entrepreneur activist
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in a state that at the very least
has medical and maybe they've got rec but
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're seeing this new opportunity
and they just want any words of advice
[SPEAKER_00]: sure um well it's not for the faint of
heart however um it could be easier than
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems i you know first of all you want
to make a relationship with your
[SPEAKER_00]: legislator so you need to know who your
senator is and who your two house of
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives are those people are your
champions and once they're just people it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems a little intimidating but once you
have those people's ear there it's their
[SPEAKER_00]: job i mean it is really their job to
listen to you and their job to try to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you to manifest especially new industry
remember this this is new industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: this will it won't generate um an adult
marijuana tax it only generates a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: sales tax but it's still business for the
state so anytime it has a monetary value
[SPEAKER_00]: to it that you've got their ear just a
little bit more but it really is just
[SPEAKER_00]: about having you know what exactly what
you want to do and aligning yourself with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that you know if it's not you
that writes the legislation then you know
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lawyer untouched with um a
legislator tell them what you need and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sometimes they have will write the
legislation for you you don't always have
[SPEAKER_00]: to write it like they have senate lawyer
you know writers that tweak all this
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation and get it into the actual
language you know the law language to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it through but they will help you along
the way it's about literally making those
[SPEAKER_00]: phone calls and setting up those
appointments and getting the air of your
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators so yeah it's not necessarily
um glamorous all the time there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: detail work and tasks no and what i did
you know i have to say that i think one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that we did that was really
smart i took my son i took my 15 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: out of school and i'm proud to talk about
this because it gave him such a civic
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson to be down there with me we went
down and we dropped off two of the paint
[SPEAKER_00]: two of the products in every single office
that's 148 offices in olympia we made sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that when they had to choose you know when
they were making the decisions on this
[SPEAKER_00]: child law that was in front of them they
knew what it looked like they knew what it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like they knew what it felt like
and so it was an education campaign down
[SPEAKER_00]: there but that was just time and a little
bit of money you know it really wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: that costly it took us two days although
the the capital security stopped us in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of our effort because they thought
that it was illegal for us to be giving
[SPEAKER_00]: our products away and yeah and so we had
to reach out and get clarification and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said come on back down i mean they
had literally set shut us down for a day
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went to their lawyers and got
back to us and said okay it's okay for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to come back so yeah so it's easy right on
so so along those similar lines you know i
[SPEAKER_01]: know that the fda watches the health and
beauty aids market really closely and i
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine that must be sticky for you are
you allowed to claim any health benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis on the packaging um no
absolutely not so so i am so i'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement and i'm not an herbal remedy so
i mean any claims that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: substantiated by science that are readily
stanchiated by science and the fact of the
[SPEAKER_00]: matter is there you know we're because of
the fear that's been around cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: all these years we're not quite there as
far as yes there's more and more research
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time i don't want to say that
there's no research out there but as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as for claims on my actual labels i don't
make any claims my labels have to be fda
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant because i am what i am you know
i have to be super super careful i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even make any claims about the arnica in
my products which i could i'm just being
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra safe and so it basically says the
fda doesn't support any claims but we
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you right on the label it says
we encourage you to do your own research
[SPEAKER_01]: on our ingredient list so i've got i've
got a similar question but i want to i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to change it up a little bit um
because um for folks who haven't like
[SPEAKER_01]: figured this out yet the the chaba the
cannabis health and beauty aids are sold
[SPEAKER_01]: that part of your line are sold in
washington because washington has the
[SPEAKER_01]: chaba law that you got passed but then you
also have um a a second half of your
[SPEAKER_01]: product line which is all made with hemp
seed oil and you know hemp seed oil has
[SPEAKER_01]: been around for decades um are you allowed
to speak about the health benefits of that
[SPEAKER_00]: even sure yes i can yeah i can anything
that's substantiated hemp oil is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a rich in essential fatty acids it's
rich in vitamin e vitamin c vitamin b it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got key amino acids i mean it's amazing
for our skin and we've we've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: input we can't grow in many states still
and you know that's a whole nother hour
[SPEAKER_00]: show um but i've been importing uh hemp
seed oil since 1994 and i've been buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it organic hemp seed oil from canada since
1999 and you know it's it's widely widely
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the united states now and just for
for good reason i mean it's you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the closest to our own natural semen it is
sebum it is the best oil for skincare for
[SPEAKER_01]: uh for humans so for other folks like i
who don't know what sebum is what is sebum
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just our own natural uh oil
production oh so like the the oil that i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel on my skin that's that's called sebum
yes and so it's see it's also got waxes in
[SPEAKER_00]: there it's you know it's it's a little
more than just what you think of as oil
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got the natural lipids very good very
good so we're going to take another short
[SPEAKER_01]: break and be right back you are listening

[SPEAKER_01]: and i'm your host shango los today's guest
is ah warner founder of cannabis basics so
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first two sets we've been talking a
whole lot about the different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: topicals and the changing of the law uh in
washington and how that could be applied
[SPEAKER_01]: across the country but i gotta say that
every time i talk to a a consumer or a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient about cannabis topicals they all
want to know if it will cause them to fail
[SPEAKER_01]: a drug test and since you do so much r and
d and are so deep in the science i think
[SPEAKER_01]: you are probably the best person to ask so
ah will using a thc cannabis topical cause
[SPEAKER_00]: someone to fail a drug test well um i
think that there are definitely people
[SPEAKER_00]: smarter than i as far as this particular
topic is concerned but the the fact of the
[SPEAKER_00]: matter is we actually don't know yet i can
tell you this this is this is what i know
[SPEAKER_00]: personally my next door neighbor she never
has never smoked pot in her life i gave
[SPEAKER_00]: her my strongest products it's about 10
milligrams per one ounce serving so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a it's well under the 0.3 thc we
tested her 15 mils for 30 days and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: her a ua and it came up negative so we
doubled the dose 30 it was 15 mils the
[SPEAKER_00]: first 30 days and then 30 mils the the
second 30 days tested her again and again
[SPEAKER_00]: it came up negative and so so i would say
that probably not but if for for for chaba
[SPEAKER_00]: highly concentrated topicals i think that
it is a possibility that it might but i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that for sure but i think that
if you are somebody who has a job with
[SPEAKER_00]: nasa or you know you're going to lose you
know your your job over a tripped up ua
[SPEAKER_00]: that i would just not quite use them yet
just not until we get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: science about how it would actually affect
a ua and what that level is for topical
[SPEAKER_01]: applications so when being used topical
topically how important is the carrier of
[SPEAKER_01]: choice by the product product designer
because you know i hear people debate oh
[SPEAKER_01]: we should use emu oil or oh no you only
need to use methanol or eucalyptus or
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and and so so you know if someone
is truly using a topical only to treat on
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the derma like for psoriasis or
eczema well that's fine but but if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using it for you know muscle relief or
anti-inflammation i would think that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to break the derma so what does
it take to carry the cannabinoids through
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin barrier well there's people use
different things and i think um some more
[SPEAKER_00]: natural than other uh you know dm dms oh
is used for penetration emu oil is used
[SPEAKER_00]: for penetration in my products i like to
go like the supernatural way hemp is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great carrier oil as well as some of the
terpenoids not only in cannabis but the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids in other essential oils like
linalool is a great carrier for the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption of the rest of the formula so
that's how i get it to be absorbed but my
[SPEAKER_00]: products aren't necessarily they're not um
they're not designed to be transdermal but
[SPEAKER_00]: they do have a fairly deep level of
penetration i do want to make one point
[SPEAKER_00]: though um as far as for if it will cross
the blood brain barrier pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything crosses the blood brain barrier
and this is why it doesn't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxication you know when we smell
lavender that the linalool gets into the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen it crosses the blood brain barrier
and so it it travels that way um but as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as uh our products the reason why it
doesn't cause intoxication is because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not enough of a level of that
activated thc to cross the blood brain
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier in a high enough concentration to
cause intoxication so it's not true that
[SPEAKER_00]: things don't cross the blood brain barrier
it is it's important that we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything does it just doesn't cross in a
level that would cause intoxication it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds to me like there's actually a whole
bunch of misinformation out there on just
[SPEAKER_01]: this little sub part because you know um
i've certainly been in the in the presence
[SPEAKER_01]: of someone who is selling a topical and
and you know a truck driver would say you
[SPEAKER_01]: know can i use this for pain relief in my
on my you know arm muscles and and and be
[SPEAKER_01]: sure i'm going to pass my my urine
analysis my urine analysis at work and it
[SPEAKER_01]: would seem that to to get your muscle
relaxation you're gonna have to break
[SPEAKER_01]: through the derma and if that's the case
we actually don't know if they could fail
[SPEAKER_01]: a drug test because the the science hasn't
been done the testing i actually i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think we know yet shango i mean there may
be somebody that knows but i that
[SPEAKER_00]: information hasn't gotten to me and i
would certainly love to hear about it if
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody has scientific evidence to show
one way or the other yeah people people
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly have a lot of strong opinions
but i haven't seen any science yet well
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it we barely have any research
at all on cannabis so the topical
[SPEAKER_00]: application of cannabis is going to be one
of the last things that really people put
[SPEAKER_00]: money behind to research and i'm doing
hoping to be doing some you know some
[SPEAKER_00]: research on my own but you know there's
just so much to study so so hopefully yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: well we got we got money in flux we got to
start somewhere so so so so ah you know i
[SPEAKER_01]: can't help but imagine that women-led
companies are just going to crush this new
[SPEAKER_01]: java market niche that you've created you
know women already lead much of both the
[SPEAKER_01]: haba industry as it is now and also the
newly forming cannabis industry and now
[SPEAKER_01]: and now when you when you put those
together into cannabis topical companies
[SPEAKER_01]: it just seems like it's there's a lot of
opportunity for women in both sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to work together yeah i think so
i mean i'm not opposed to working with
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody and and you know i did i just want
to throw out some props um you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of the the stronger brands here in
washington are actually run by men and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a great company in in colorado
that's uh that's run by an amazing guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: used to work for aveda but the women seem
to be and i'll tell you my the female
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective is that um great manufacturers
here megan kush creams love her that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: sister i'm doing a great job with chaba
but the great thing is also the buyers
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those buyers tend to be female in
these grocery stores and you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're tend to be the people that
actually buy the products and give them to
[SPEAKER_00]: their partners or you know what i mean so
it's not just about the manufacturers it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about who is actually buying these and who
is you know who who's going to really push
[SPEAKER_00]: the market forward and and that's those
buyers and then down to the consumers the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers they're the ones spending the
money the the women are what the i forget
[SPEAKER_00]: what the statistic is but they spend 65
percent or something of the household
[SPEAKER_00]: money so it will be female driven it you
know it's a lot roundabout way of
[SPEAKER_00]: confirming that question and i love it i i
love the women in our community you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's an amazing uh camaraderie so you
know i know that a lot of what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about today has been about this
revolutionary law and how it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: model for other states but i also know
that you are an expert product developer
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know and you're a mover and shaker
when it comes to your product line so so
[SPEAKER_01]: what's coming up for cannabis basics what
do you see in the future for your company
[SPEAKER_00]: well we're super excited now that we we
just got all our new display boxes so we
[SPEAKER_00]: literally we look seriously legit on a
grocery store shelf now so that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting and that you know the
distribution company is just getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go full force on that right now in the
next six months we're all about community
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach so we're doing a lot of fairs and
festivals we're doing pride we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: you know of course we we sponsor him fest
every year we're doing uncorked in
[SPEAKER_00]: kirkland you know we're really just trying
to get out there and let the brand be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: by people that aren't in the cannabis
community it's about the mainstreaming of
[SPEAKER_00]: can't chava right now for us and then as
far as um you know there's a fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: new you know four years ago when i was
thinking about these products i was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the whole avon and mary k
kind of situation and you know i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: really crazy about the pyramid markings
marketing scheme but i have found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple weeks that there's been a
really a huge influx of retired aged women
[SPEAKER_00]: that still have a business license and
they're finding us and they want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reps for my company and i just have this
vision of this army of retired women
[SPEAKER_00]: having parties and selling chava to you
know and word of mouth we all know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the best advertising ever you know
so that's a brand new kind of marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: that i really wasn't focused on until just
this last couple months you know so as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as selling the product it's you know
there's so many different avenues um one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things about cannabis is that is
that it is so effective that um mostly you
[SPEAKER_01]: just have to tell folk it's folks it's
available and they're suddenly interested
[SPEAKER_00]: oh oh and it's cool that's the other thing
it's got a cool factor not only is it
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people with their eggs and pains
and skin issues and all that good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: but but these people want to be connected
to this hip thing right now like we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden kind of trending you know so
that's amazing um the last one thing i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say about the future of cannabis
basics is that we're actually looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: property right now i think i mentioned to
see you we're we're building in a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: complex with a manufacturing facility and
going to be doing hemp research um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know growing hemp and processing hemp seed
because we're now it's legal to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: washington state as of this year this is
they're rolling out the industrial hemp uh
[SPEAKER_00]: research program so we're looking for
property right now to kind of build that
[SPEAKER_00]: dream it'll have a museum aspect to it
there'll be classes there'll be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: event center some overnight stay hemp
creek cabins so the vision is very big but
[SPEAKER_01]: uh it's very bright as well that sounds
