[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for checking out the
analytical reading program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're grateful to have this time and
ultimately have time with really a
[SPEAKER_03]: collection of people who, as Dr. Mark
Lewis was just pointing out, are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: championing the level of innovation that
has never happened in our space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean internationally, really
focusing on the fundamental aspect in our
[SPEAKER_03]: equation here, which is the planet itself
and the relationship between plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: people, but using technology and tools to
go into new levels of expression of this
[SPEAKER_03]: ancient relationship that I think are
going to provide tremendously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, each one of these people
is just a monstrous force of innovation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's an honor to get to moderate this
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Jeremy Plumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the director of production science at
Proof cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a high-tech controlled environment
facility, and I've been working in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Founded a dispensary called Pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Co-founded a building cannabis project,
and founded an event called the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivation Classic in Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the honor of working with some of
these folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on panels over the years,
and I feel like in a bit of a way,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to quite say,
this year, things are really going to a
[SPEAKER_03]: new level, and really I want to make sure
to allocate plenty of time to hearing
[SPEAKER_03]: where those levels are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to start with the basic
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Analytical breeding implies that there is
technology facilitating outcomes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: genomic space, and that ultimately that
results in a chemotypic outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I would like to talk about first
would be just to have them introduce
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves and then go into what is your
experience with using analytics and
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding to actually get into this space
of creating plants that are more useful
[SPEAKER_03]: and to really break new ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, ask some introductions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Josh Worzer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the president of SC Labs, and we're an
analytical testing lab based in Santa
[SPEAKER_07]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been testing cannabis now for almost
10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started out actually working at a ready
shop, Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Worked there for a year, and I don't have
experience with breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have experience with the analytical side
of the thing in supporting breeders,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's just been exciting to see people
kind of take breeding to the next level
[SPEAKER_07]: from kind of the, you know, garage
breeding that we had earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Early on, we were just crossing hybrids
and hoping for something interesting to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, kind of what we're seeing today,
which is a really interesting chemotypic
[SPEAKER_07]: expression that is kind of finally tapping
into the potential of what cannabis can
[SPEAKER_07]: do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you have this plant that can
produce all these very unique,
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting bioactive cannabinoids,
and really we're only playing with a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a plant that can also produce all of
this unique terpene profile that can
[SPEAKER_07]: potentiate those effects potentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: And give unique flavors and aroma to
cannabis, and we're really only working
[SPEAKER_07]: with, you know, maybe 7, 8, 9,
10 of those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been exciting to see,
these people really kind of starting to
[SPEAKER_07]: challenge that and challenge what the
plant can do and produce interesting,
[SPEAKER_07]: cool, unique strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Virginia Dino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the president of Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the director of R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, this has been a really exciting
time because I come out of plant biotech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this has been interesting to see an
industry that should have as much
[SPEAKER_02]: information about their plant as any other
cash crop because we are as big a cash
[SPEAKER_02]: crop as any other crop in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was interesting for me
to be able to come into this industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, oh, wow, we know nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to start to compile the data from
the tens of thousands of tests that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: done and to start to see trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those trends are what Josh is talking
about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we can start to see, oh,
these plants, obviously CBD and THC were
[SPEAKER_02]: the first ones, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a plant that makes over 500
active compounds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And by active compounds, I mean they have
biological activity that we know of
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know of their corresponding or
exactly the same compounds in other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that they have functionality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what we can do at the
end of the day at the analytical chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: level is actually use some of those tests
as markers for breeding without even going
[SPEAKER_02]: into genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you have an outcome,
you can follow it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the beauty of analytical
chemistry in the early days of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry because there were markers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see the results of a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we've taken to the next level
where we now have marker assisted
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start to do the same things that the
Monsantos and the Dow Ags can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things will help improve the
products that we make on our site.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, before waiting for a big Ag to
get into it, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seth Crawford, co-founder of Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're an industrial hemp seed research and
development company based in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that wasn't funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background is I'm actually a PhD in
sociology and my analytical training was
[SPEAKER_05]: in analyzing large multi-causal data sets,
looking at world energy problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also had a killer breeding facility in
my garage for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was teaching a cannabis policy class
at Oregon State where I taught for 13
[SPEAKER_05]: years and it happened to coincide with
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a recreational adult use THC
legalization and industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And industrial hemp was legalized in
Oregon one month before the 2014 farm bill
[SPEAKER_05]: passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read the farm bill, read the Oregon law
and said, oh man, we've got plants that
[SPEAKER_05]: fit that bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main driver of this for me was
moving from plant counts and canopy size
[SPEAKER_05]: limits to unlimited numbers of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as soon as you have access to very
large populations and you have those
[SPEAKER_05]: analytical capabilities, you can start to
tease apart some of the most incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: things from this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They manifest themselves consistently as
long as you are looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today we are going into our fifth year of
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had over 4,000 acres of industrial hemp
grown in the United States using our high
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, high terpene content, feminized
industrial hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking at about 100 million
seed capacity for this upcoming year with
[SPEAKER_05]: the expansion of the farm bill,
in addition to a number of different novel
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds that we've successfully
isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you guys that don't know,
Seth has also developed one of the very
[SPEAKER_04]: impressive American high-CBG cultivars,
which is quite a feat that we haven't seen
[SPEAKER_04]: anything quite like that on the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big props to you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Ryan Lee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the founder of Chimera Genetics,
which is a seed company we run out of
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also have a company called Chimabar
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do, like I said, Chimera Genetic
imports for Canadian LPs and plant
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also worked with NAEPRO Research Mark
Lewis for a few years down here between
[SPEAKER_04]: 2013 and 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a lot of fun developing some
pretty interesting Chimabars, some of
[SPEAKER_04]: which you saw on the screen in a previous
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on analytics, how do we talk about how
it impacts us as cultivators and selectors
[SPEAKER_04]: and breeders?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the truth is that we've all
been doing this all along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that's selecting plants or growing
plants and selecting using our nose and
[SPEAKER_04]: our lungs and our brain, bioassaying these
things, analytics really gives us a sixth
[SPEAKER_04]: or seventh sense, a way to look at these
plants that we can't, you can't pick up a
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and smell it and say, oh,
there's seven milligrams of limonene in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we rely on technology to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we started relying on
technology, we've seen some pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for example, Molecular Farms last
year, one of our clients through NAEPRO,
[SPEAKER_04]: they won first place in a couple of
different categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was the PhD category with
their lemon crush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the first varieties
that was really created through directed
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis, chasing compounds using a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some people in the community
that didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that they cheated, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to me, it's not cheating to use an
analytical method.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're in this developing
industry and we want to use all the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology that we can to further our
goal, because our goal is to further the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: To make better plants for consumers,
better plants for growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the laboratory is just a tool to help
us do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to actually cure just a
couple of specific examples of using the
[SPEAKER_03]: analytical technology, which clearly
culminates in a kind of chemotypic
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis that will validate that the
phytochemical inventory of a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: accurately has these compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, there's other analytical
tools that are being used to optimize
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding and the outcomes in the plants
that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if Seth, maybe you could
describe a little bit about other tools
[SPEAKER_03]: you have used prior to the chemotype to
optimize the plants and to get to these
[SPEAKER_03]: outrageous outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, by the way, not just what we're
calling a type four plant, which is CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: knockouts that have high CBG, like the
most I've heard actually from a valid lab
[SPEAKER_03]: result so far anywhere, but also I'm
hearing a type five plant, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: null.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rich in terpenes and no other
cannabinoids, which has a lot of very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting implications.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Seth, anything about your fucking
amazing story that you can share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides lots and lots of testing,
we spend literally years in the lab using
[SPEAKER_05]: every single testing and analytical tool
that we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Metonics is a good example.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a vendor here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of a rough HPLC system that we
use for screening, but it allows us to,
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't work right, actually,
for a number of the compounds that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for, but it messes up in a way
that's predictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've run...
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've run 5,000 tests with the machine
and you've got all the data to back it up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you look at it and go, and you've set it
off for third-party analysis with a
[SPEAKER_05]: confident lab, you can start to see the
pattern emerge, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main thing that we do outside of the
analytical testing is actual field trials
[SPEAKER_05]: for our cultivars that we release to
farmers, which is something that is sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of a, it's a nice number in the THC
industry for the most part because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: small sample size that most farmers are
working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: As Mark said earlier at that previous
presentation, 10 phenotypes and 10 seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing something that is
literally thousands of acres at a time,
[SPEAKER_05]: you cannot have that type of phenotypic
variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We say that our plants are homozygous for
very particular traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that because we've done
large-scale field trials the year before
[SPEAKER_05]: where we evaluated 20 different mothers
that were separated out from 1,000
[SPEAKER_05]: different plants to get to that point to
see which one actually recombines and
[SPEAKER_05]: creates a good field plant that farmers
can succeed with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like when you're seeing
thousands of acres of your seed out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants are naked.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was any error in your breeding,
it's going to show up and people are not
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be happy, which was evidenced
this year in Oregon with a number of,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, less than savory industrial hemp seed
providers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan, I'm wondering with your experience,
not just with Napro, but especially with
[SPEAKER_03]: Napro and the survey of the chemoscape
that took place in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: which actually I'm not sure if anybody is
aware of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you missed this last talk that Dr. Mark
Lewis led, Napro led an effort,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a very sophisticated effort to look
at what is out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's beyond THC and CVD and what's the
inventory of this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately it was the most mature work
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you were deeply involved with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about some of the,
the analytical work outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: chemoscape data that were, or the
analytical tools, rather, that were used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be productive in creating a really
mature body of work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we really looked at chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Mark's a chemist and
obviously that kind of drives the mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, Mark has this thing he
says, and it's very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the, the, the, the metabolome or the
chemistry that is produced by the plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: really a reflection of the genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, like Reggie was saying
earlier, we don't necessarily have to go
[SPEAKER_04]: and use all these tools to start poking
around the genome when just by using the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemistry assay, we can actually get a
whole bunch of information about what the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant produces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was really our focus was,
you know, HPLC for cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_04]: GCFID for, for, for turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we had the, like,
like SC and Steve Hill, we did intake for
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries, you know, in the process of
these many tens of thousands of samples
[SPEAKER_04]: that came through the laboratory with a
flower destined to end up on the shelves
[SPEAKER_04]: of a dispensary, we were able to take this
analytical data and really plot what we
[SPEAKER_04]: saw in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I think SC labs and Steve Hill
labs probably have very similar data as
[SPEAKER_04]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get, as you're running thousands and
thousands of tests, you start to group
[SPEAKER_04]: things and see that there's different
types and, and you see what exists in the
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also see the holes in what doesn't
exist in the market, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what we know theoretically exists in
the space and, and then how do we fill
[SPEAKER_04]: those, those needs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mark said earlier, it's like,
that's innovation, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, you see where, what's,
what's a missing skew and then we can use
[SPEAKER_04]: that information to go and develop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the qualities I know that I hear
advanced readers speaking to as an outcome
[SPEAKER_03]: of analytically assisted breeding is
really hitting stabilization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's been some potentially,
like, abuse of that idea in that we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what we're talking about when we talk
about stability in a broad and general
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Seth pointed out, I think it's
important to think about what sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: traits we're trying to stabilize and see
consistent and homozygous expression in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if you could describe some of
the traits that you would prioritize in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of stabilizing for consumer
relevance and market relevance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It totally depends on what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any good breeding project starts with
that, that originating question,
[SPEAKER_05]: what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you trying to make?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you trying to have a fuel flavored,
dense, tall, short flowering plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: or are you looking for something that has
other characteristics?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, that is everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you build, build out from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you make it personal?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_05]: My goal is to make sure that we have
access to all of these different compounds
[SPEAKER_05]: for people and animals at a reasonable
price.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been fantastic, fantastic research
has been done by GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a 15 year monopoly, a huge head
start in this industry, and they have
[SPEAKER_05]: these wonderful plants that just sit in a
building.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doing any good right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while there's great information that
can be derived from pharmaceutical trials,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I encourage companies to continue
doing that type of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just getting the compounds out into the
public sphere for people to use and try
[SPEAKER_05]: and say, well, this works for this or this
works for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea that CBDV is just like
nicotine and coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's find out if that's true for the
entire population or if it's just a subset
[SPEAKER_05]: of the population with a very specific,
very specific genetic makeup, right?
It's.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to look at what our goals are
before we head down those paths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean that having a goal thing is
really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the way the cannabis community
currently works is, you know, people find
[SPEAKER_04]: that they do these phenotype selections
and you say grow 100,000 plants and you
[SPEAKER_04]: find a truly special plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they want to breed that,
so they cross it to OG, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of OGifies everything in the
market and it brings back this uniformity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of, it's like I said,
these breeding programs don't have a goal
[SPEAKER_04]: other than I've got something special and
I need to do something with it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you have something special,
again, you have to think about what your
[SPEAKER_04]: goal is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I trying to replicate this thing that I
found into a seed line?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like Seth said, you have to start
with a goal, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And every breeding program really has to
have a goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just about throwing pollen around
and trying to find something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paying your mortgage is not an acceptable
one of those goals either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add just a different spin on
stability, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So stability, when you talk about it the
way Seth talks about it, the goal is
[SPEAKER_02]: established and you're going after the
specific trait or traits and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program accentuates that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a whole other level of
stability in ag that we kind of ignore,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we are stuck with clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the future of this industry cannot be
clone-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want everybody to sort of...
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only way to make it not
clone-based is to understand basic
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding techniques and then to breed for
what is true stability so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a unique donor, a pollen donor,
a unique flower donor, and then every time
[SPEAKER_02]: you breed them, you get the same genetics
out, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that requires a lot of in-breeding,
back-crossing, traditional agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding that we do not do yet in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Yeah, I mean, I don't have too much
to add other than... I would second what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're saying, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as well as stability, I think when
you're breeding for traits outside of the
[SPEAKER_07]: chemotypic traits, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But achieving stability with your
chemotypic analysis is important too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think early on, the laboratories
didn't necessarily even have the right
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of tools to give these guys all the
information they need.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think it's necessarily the
breeding community's fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they didn't necessarily have the
tools until really recently to go in and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually breed for some of these
chemotypic traits that now we're starting
[SPEAKER_07]: to see kind of explode as a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we didn't have analytical
standards for a lot of the compounds you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys are actually expressing in the plant
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we know that chemical analytical
testing services have really blazed a
[SPEAKER_03]: trail by which producers could derive
insight and really understand sort of what
[SPEAKER_03]: the inventory of the plants were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt very fortunate in Oregon to have
met a man named Pat Marshall who was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually doing testing from the mid-90s
and really was an activist chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: analyst who was looking at 64 compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there was a grower ecosystem
that started to circle around that chemist
[SPEAKER_03]: who were the people who actually
understood what the inventory in the state
[SPEAKER_03]: was, and that it was game-changing in
Oregon to have just a single lab that was
[SPEAKER_03]: available and offering the service.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we, of course, have really many
at-scale mature labs, SC Labs and Steep
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill, two really prominent industry
leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you can talk about a bit
of like this trend where you started and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a Steep Hill where it was,
you know, this initial effort that was
[SPEAKER_03]: very challenging to even, when you deal
with like producers coming into a very
[SPEAKER_03]: low-margin scenario, and expecting to get
basically unlimited services for nearly
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing, and you have capital-intensive
equipment and high-paying scientists and
[SPEAKER_03]: this, I mean, just this unbelievable
complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit about your messy birth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, early on, actually,
early on, it was a really boring job.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we were analyzing for three
cannabinoids that we could give reference
[SPEAKER_07]: standards for on a GC, so we weren't even
looking at acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking at THC, CBD, and CBN.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all day long, you kind of look at the
same chromatograph over and over and over,
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes the peak can be a little higher,
sometimes a little bit lower, but you
[SPEAKER_07]: know, we were just analyzing for THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was even before, you know,
we even had an idea of testing for
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember the very first CBD strain
that came through.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, oh, well, something
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was an OG cross with blueberry
from Harborside, and that was the first
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD strain that I know that was being sold
kind of in California as kind of a
[SPEAKER_07]: verified CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, anyone could have just went and
talked to a hemp reader, obviously,
[SPEAKER_07]: but on the drug market, it was the first
CBD strain that was commercially
[SPEAKER_07]: available, and you just changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, I mean, we have 14, 15
cannabinoids that most of the labs are
[SPEAKER_07]: testing for, dozens of terpenes,
and so, you know, it's come a long way,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's become a much more interesting
job.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, for so long, we're seeing kind
of the same chromatograms a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, it's just been really exciting to
watch the work these guys have done,
[SPEAKER_07]: because it makes our job more interesting,
and we're actually, all these extra
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds we're testing for, now it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, like I said, really,
up until the last few years, we've had
[SPEAKER_07]: high THC, high CBD, maybe a little bit of
CBG, one or two percent, and green crack
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that, and six or seven
terpenes really expressed, and it's been
[SPEAKER_07]: just exciting to see kind of this come
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes it's by accident,
sometimes you see someone doesn't even
[SPEAKER_07]: know what they have, but you can only go
so far on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, it's really changed even just in
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Messy Birth, so, I mean, I think when
he started, he started with Steve also,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so, the Messy Birth, it was just
describing, I think, describes exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what I would say anyway, but I would like
to add to that that the other part of your
[SPEAKER_02]: statement where people come in and expect
all this free testing for the margins,
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot tell you how many times I have
heard the, hey, you should let us test for
[SPEAKER_02]: free, because we'll make your lab better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let me, pay me first, and then if it's
different, I'll give you your money back,
[SPEAKER_02]: because exactly what Josh said,
they all kind of look the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only more recently that the job
really has expanded, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of the things that we are noticing
from this expansion is that we've really
[SPEAKER_02]: done a lot of damage to this plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a recent paper came out where there
are some compounds that you can only find
[SPEAKER_02]: in CBD lineages because we've broken the
THC pathway so badly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, one of the things that has to come out
of, I think, all of this is our
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of what we left behind and
how to try to get it back, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people who are out on the forefront of
the analytical chemistry side,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's great because there's analytical
chemistry available to growers now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I can tell you that one lab is not the
same as another.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody has submitted flower samples to
a lab for testing, you know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can take one flower, submit it to a
lab, and say a CBG flower, and we'll get a
[SPEAKER_05]: 20% result back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We send it to a lab that we trust,
and we get it on 16% back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 4%, but 4% in that situation is 25%
of the total cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge margin there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You send it to another lab, and they tell
you it's CBN, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's, and this is in Oregon
with accredited labs, labs that are
[SPEAKER_05]: accredited by national organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they have to go through potency
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been screened, they've been tested
over and over, but there's still a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: disparity between good labs and not so
good labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to preempt and segue this inter-lab
variability conversation, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a doozy because here we have the
ability for the first time in history to
[SPEAKER_03]: really understand the inventory of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simultaneously, we have consumers who do
not trust the output of the analytical
[SPEAKER_03]: testing facilities due to this inter-lab
variance, and the reality is, as a
[SPEAKER_03]: producer, I can affirm that I can find
such an unbelievably gross range testing
[SPEAKER_03]: between different analytical testing
services that, as a dispensary founder,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things I have done is simply
require everybody to test through one lab
[SPEAKER_03]: because I wanted to have a patient
resource that actually started to
[SPEAKER_03]: provision accurately curative cultivars or
chemivores, and the reality is,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even in 2018 and now into 2019,
we expect to continue to see inter-lab
[SPEAKER_03]: variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to any of the efforts that
are put to ultimately resolve some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge to provide consumers and
patients with reliable information?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, inter-lab variability starts at the
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, labs actually have their own
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be lying if I said different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make mistakes, machines go out of
calibration, they break, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, we're dealing with a
very heterogeneous plant where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have, from one bud to another on the same
plant, a 10% variance in THC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question then becomes is,
how is the sample coming into the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: first?
[SPEAKER_02]: How consistently are the samples that are
being batched together to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory batch, how consistent is it in
the grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what is the lab then doing to
make sure that they minimize that
[SPEAKER_02]: homogeneity or its heterogeneity by the
proper lab technique in the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to say that labs like SC
and us, and if you see a 10% difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between SC and us, a 10%, 10% in science
is actually an acceptable number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not make you happy as a client,
but it's an acceptable number in science.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're plus or minus 10%, you're pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be plus or minus 5%,
but realistically, in a very heterogeneous
[SPEAKER_02]: matrix, that's a good number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I will also say that
because of the stuff that's going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: labs now have to be ISO certified,
and as ISO certification comes along,
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually have to do a lot more jumping
through hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay to get your CRMs, or certified
reference materials, from one provider
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that you're ISO accredited,
you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have multiple sources for your
CRMs so that you can cross check them
[SPEAKER_02]: before you even use them in your
analytical batch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So because of that, what we're seeing is,
I was just in another cross lab comparison
[SPEAKER_02]: for an R&D sample thing for somebody out
of state, and they tested it with three
[SPEAKER_02]: labs, and all three labs came in within
one or two percent most of the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the interlab variability is
going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to add to that, that was with
terpenes, which I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting terpenes right, because they're so
volatile, is really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had three labs in this cross
comparison that all came in within,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, in terpenes that's no higher than a
five to six percent difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the labs were getting better,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all had the same exact single batch
oil we were working with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the oil that we started with was very
homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to add those things together
and understand the whole process,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll start with California,
because I think the two states,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we have a lab outside of Portland as
well, and I think the two states have very
[SPEAKER_07]: different regulatory regimes, and I think
different challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So not only California is regulated,
labs are forced to do a lot more quality
[SPEAKER_07]: control, have run LQC's quality control
samples with every batch that checked that
[SPEAKER_07]: calibration so your machine can't drift
out of calibration, so you can catch and
[SPEAKER_07]: carry over, you can catch all these
issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: That prop up, and a lot of labs weren't
doing that before, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Price pressure, you know, when you're in a
voluntary market and you can only get,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 50, 60 bucks for a test,
that should be 150, you know, quality is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people are going to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now in California, you have a lot of new
labs in the market, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have thought they saw billions of
dollars in the testing market,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is silly, but, and you jumped in and
bought a bunch of equipment and didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily have the wherewithal,
or haven't had the time to get up to speed
[SPEAKER_07]: since we're all, you know, developing our
own methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you're going to see a little bit of
that in California as well, but at least
[SPEAKER_07]: in California, what we've seen is the
regulators are going to come down on you
[SPEAKER_07]: and shut you down if you're not doing a
good job, and that's been proven out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the key thing, is good oversight
from the people who are regulating the
[SPEAKER_07]: labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not going to have good oversight
on the people regulating the labs,
[SPEAKER_07]: then why aren't we doing any of this?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, mandatory testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because otherwise, when you have what
happens in Oregon, where you have several
[SPEAKER_07]: labs that are just openly, you know,
kind of, I don't know how they're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it, but getting their customers an extra
five, six percentage points not relative,
[SPEAKER_07]: absolute, on their THC test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we have customers that come
to us and, you know, even say,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, sure, we'll do some pesticide
testing with you, but sorry, we can't do
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid testing with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a competition thing, and we've had so
much downward pressure in the Oregon
[SPEAKER_07]: market that they need those extra few
points to sell their product, and they
[SPEAKER_07]: know, everyone knows what's going on,
and the state's not doing a damn thing
[SPEAKER_07]: about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I would, you know,
it's not a good, good oversight system,
[SPEAKER_07]: and so it's allowing this to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: What it does is it drives the labs that
are not cheating out of business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, that's the same thing that's going
to happen in California if the regulators
[SPEAKER_07]: ever kind of get lax on the labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a pain in the ass,
and I get scared every time I get a call
[SPEAKER_07]: from the BCC, but really, that's what's
going to keep the labs that are doing it
[SPEAKER_07]: right in business.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a strong oversight of the testers,
because if they put us in the kind of hall
[SPEAKER_07]: monitor position, someone has to be
keeping a really good eye on the fact that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're doing what we need to do,
because we serve a very critical function,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then there's, you know, there's a lot
of, I guess, incentive for, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: bad actors or ladies, and both of them can
be equally as damaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wilson, such a critical point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as an example, Josh just said that it
drives the good actors out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shut my New Mexico lab down exactly
for that reason, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, ouch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think part of that you've got
to remember is we, as a industry and as a
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer base, are actually responsible
for this, too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you don't go into a wine store or
liquor store and ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the highest alcohol content beer,
what's the highest alcohol content whiskey
[SPEAKER_04]: or wine, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's not the way that we
consume those products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we put such a pressure on these,
on labs, really, because people want to
[SPEAKER_04]: get these high dollars for high THC
content, it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a good metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we, you know,
we really need to do a better job of
[SPEAKER_04]: teaching consumers that it's not,
you know, that's not the way to find a
[SPEAKER_04]: good product for your, for your ailment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't go into a dispensary and say,
hey, what's the highest?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or people do, but they shouldn't,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Greeks have this word called
achatos, which is like the final thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, it's also the beginning of a
new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mirror, or rather the metaphor
I've heard is you throw this stone into
[SPEAKER_03]: the pond and ripples are happening,
but the time is actually the ripples that
[SPEAKER_03]: have already occurred after the event that
has been the central event.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this notion of when chemical
analytical testing came into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: it fundamentally disrupted the long-term
consumer relationship that fomented in the
[SPEAKER_03]: underground and the prohibition era
especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my sense is that what we're living
through is actually a lot of ripples.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already now have the ability to
actually get out of interlab variability
[SPEAKER_03]: and have really reliable testing data,
but that means now we have to update
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of the frustration,
and I've heard some of it expressed here
[SPEAKER_03]: and I certainly feel an abundance of it,
is that we have a consumer trend pursuing
[SPEAKER_03]: high THC over any other quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have growers who I was just talking to,
brilliant, like some of the best growers
[SPEAKER_03]: we have, having to sell much worse flour
that are testing really high or testing in
[SPEAKER_03]: labs that are unscrupulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Indica and Zetiva frameworks,
which are sort of cultural attributes that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can't actually define by science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have so much catching up to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'm just wondering if there's
any sort of, like here we've got
[SPEAKER_03]: analytical breeding at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a future to look forward to of
moderately dosed products that are
[SPEAKER_03]: incredibly chemo diverse and very
sophisticated and able to speak to
[SPEAKER_03]: people's needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we really have in the way is the
education and sort of popular education
[SPEAKER_03]: platform issue with how do we get the
consumers and the patients and the market
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually sort of acknowledge this event
which has occurred, which is that we must
[SPEAKER_03]: reframe how we view cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do a small start.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say that those ripples, it's a great
metaphor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ripples are definitely out there,
but most of them are not from THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most of the ripples in the pond
around us right now are non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your grandmother who is responsible
for a lot of the shift in public
[SPEAKER_05]: perception.
[SPEAKER_05]: THC is a niche drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But only about 20% of the population
consumes it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then, only a small portion,
about 20% of that 20% drives the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the people that you need to
target in terms of education and making
[SPEAKER_05]: sure that they're on board with new
knowledge about terpene diversity or
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor profiles and the different effects
that those will have on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's those other markets with
different compounds that is the other 80%
[SPEAKER_05]: of the population and then animals and
that sort of stuff I think where the
[SPEAKER_05]: popular consciousness actually gets a hold
of this plant where you can see that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: not just for recreational use or for
certain aspects of pain that come along
[SPEAKER_05]: with psychoactive implications.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole lot more out there,
including the replacement of hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need hops anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hops, I love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a cousin, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But they take a huge amount of
agricultural infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take five years to get to maturity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every five years, 20% of the hop vines
in Oregon and Washington get ripped out
[SPEAKER_05]: because of disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: With cannabis, you can have a single,
you can have a crop that grows once every
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets replaced by seed and produces
exactly the same compounds that hops do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, popular consciousness is
already changing and I think it's being
[SPEAKER_05]: carried out by a lot of different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just our burden in a place like
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's society that's moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like everybody to go on out and check
it out too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a company here called Phytology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got this variety of guava jam
that, like I said, one, I guess it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you haven't tried it and you're
interested in these plants with different
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds, I suggest going and getting
yourself a pre-roll of this stuff and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a CBD, CBDV plant with like one
milligram of THC per gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like extremely low THC content.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you smoke this, and about five,
10 minutes later, I don't know if I would
[SPEAKER_04]: describe it as nicotine, caffeine,
but you definitely feel an effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you smoke this stuff and you
realize, hey, I'm high, and then you think
[SPEAKER_04]: it in the context of, wait, there was no
THC in that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it kind of recalibrates our
expectations because really, it's about
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about, it's about user
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about, again, this high THC
number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out if you haven't tried those
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, and I've got a few things I
think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, one of the big reasons I think THC
is kind of such a, has become what it is
[SPEAKER_07]: as far as kind of selection of purchasing
decisions is it's the cost of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you cost $50 for an eighth of
cannabis and get a couple of joints out of
[SPEAKER_07]: it, I mean, I would want the biggest bang
for my buck too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so as we see kind of cannabis kind of
come down to kind of earth in price,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe people will just kind of start to
drift away from that and start looking
[SPEAKER_07]: back at, I want cannabis that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want, you know, I want quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I mean, if you really have the need
to measure something, the lab should be
[SPEAKER_07]: cheating on a total turkey contact because
I would say that's your quantitative
[SPEAKER_07]: quality indicator much more so than THC at
least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just think, I think naturally
over time as cannabis becomes more
[SPEAKER_07]: available, it's more reasonably priced,
and consumers will start looking to other
[SPEAKER_07]: things just, you know, how high can I get
off of, you know, a couple of hits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so hopefully it'll sort itself out a
little bit too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree, the other cannabinoids are
the future in a much wider, wider market
[SPEAKER_07]: than just THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea that THC drives everything,
the reality is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we were to use the proper terminology,
if we get high, well, CBD gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a different way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so the term is psychotropic
versus, you know, psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still psycho, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, that came out wrong,
however.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, meaning that no matter how you
look at it, you're still having an effect
[SPEAKER_02]: on the brain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the effects gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like everybody who has not yet
smoked CBD by itself to go smoke CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me if you don't feel more relaxed
afterwards, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were feeling more relaxed,
I'm sorry, but you got high, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so that's one aspect as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the other aspect is,
you know, if we start to think back to old
[SPEAKER_02]: school weed like Acapulco Gold and Panama
Red, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things only made four,
six, eight percent, but they made a
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendous amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at land raises in general,
right, you see a much broader terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: content where you have a much higher
expression on more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back in the day, we got really high
off of that stuff because of the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we see now is that as you go and
drive up the THC content, the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile gets narrower and the number of
things that express at a high level go
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chase for THC may not be getting us
where we really want to go.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we have about five minutes,
I want to make sure you get access to
[SPEAKER_03]: these genuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, if you have not heard
Shango Woese's interview with Seth
[SPEAKER_03]: Brofford talking about some of the
analytical breeding methodology he did on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Shaking Fire podcast where some of the
best content I've heard in the last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of years publicly shared is, I would
highly recommend checking out that
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, similarly, the brain trust on the
stage has gotten me so jacked and excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could enjoy this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you as all
technology-assisted breeder folk who I
[SPEAKER_01]: respect, you know, there's this continuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got males and females to make new
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing that for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got analytical abilities to
really look at what we're doing and help
[SPEAKER_01]: speed up processes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got the part that,
you know, people are talking about like
[SPEAKER_01]: invasive breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're starting to get involved with
CRISPR and, you know, editing the genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as people who I, everybody here I
respect, where do you personally put that
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold on where along the line is
reasonable and worthwhile to press to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach these goals that we have before
you're all like, okay, that's where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to draw my line for whatever reason
you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll start because I don't have much,
but I would say there's so much left to do
[SPEAKER_07]: before we hit that line that, you know,
let's exhaust those options first and then
[SPEAKER_07]: we can start talking about CRISPR and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think, I mean, listen to things
Seth's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark and Ryan, I mean, they're doing
amazing things and they're not,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're not editing anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I think this plant can do a
lot once we start pushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for thousands of years we didn't have
CRISPR or anything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we did a good job on all our
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, traditional genetic breeding
is a very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most powerful tool set in that tool is
the breeder himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to observe,
you have to be able to take notes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to be able to record and follow
over trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can do that, you've got the game
beat pretty much, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, you can do better if you have
analytical tools and ultimately the
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimate expression of that is to take
those analytical tools, find out what the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical compounds are because they are
your metrics by which you measure and then
[SPEAKER_02]: dive into the genome so that now you can
do it faster and increase generational
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you can look at the seed,
as soon as it's cracked, you have your
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings and you can do a genetic test
and you find you have all the alleles you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, then you're off to the races,
you get rid of the rest, you force flower
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys and you do your next round,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really do generational cycling
as many as four to six, a year if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: the right tools, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's ultimately where we need to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CRISPR is one of those things where
when you've maxed out everything you can
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly do, you do gene editing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we are nowhere near, nowhere near
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention the fact that what we're
finding out is that CRISPR makes other
[SPEAKER_02]: mistakes, other places that we don't know
about, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: CRISPR for cannabis is like someone who
can't quite pay attention long enough to
[SPEAKER_05]: get through a sentence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honest to God, at this point I feel the
same way as these two gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much that hasn't been
discovered at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why go down a path that could potentially
introduce all kinds of problems?
[SPEAKER_05]: For at least with our breeding program,
there's so many, every time we submit
[SPEAKER_05]: samples we get something that comes back
that says, you know, there's a spike on
[SPEAKER_05]: your chromatogram and we don't know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't either, so, you know, it goes on
in two or three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, when you look at the history of
plant breeding, traditional plant breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: with other crops, it's gone through
phases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first major phase in the green
revolution was the advent of hybrids,
[SPEAKER_05]: the creation of F1s, which require line
breeding of two separate lines,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then recombination once you've fixed
the specific traits that you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: followed by field trials to establish
which of those parental lines are the
[SPEAKER_05]: best.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an awesome, it's an awesome
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next stage after that was mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is involving either ploidy
increases or decreases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking in cannabis now about
creating haploid lines, which basically
[SPEAKER_05]: have half the chromosomes of the plant,
but those chromosomes, when you double it
[SPEAKER_05]: again, lead to true breeding stock with
one generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge generational leaping tool for
cannabis breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't require, this is something that
happens naturally in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say it on a regular basis,
but it does happen and all we're doing is
[SPEAKER_05]: inducing that quicker in a lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: CRISPR is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: CRISPR is a very different animal and I
think we're not there yet, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think kind of a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not opposed to CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_04]: CRISPR is just a tool to edit the genome,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all these other tools like
tail end or, you know, zinc finger
[SPEAKER_04]: nucleases and all these things that we can
use to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis is a special plant in that it
breeds very similar to the way that humans
[SPEAKER_04]: breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think about a tomato,
for example, a tomato is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: grown in the greenhouse and a bee comes
along and pollinates it, self-pollinates,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it produces a seed in a tomato,
where if that tomato didn't come from a
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid seed, it came from an heirloom
tomato seed, you can take that seed out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the tomato and plant it and grow it into a
new plant and the fruit on that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: would be identical to the plant that it
came from and so on and so forth for 20
[SPEAKER_04]: generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we all know that when we grow
cannabis and you cross two plants
[SPEAKER_04]: together, that the plants that come out at
the end, they don't look like that and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's because we're what we call obligate
outcrossers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have another individual of the
same species to procreate and that brings
[SPEAKER_04]: in a separate genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: into the mix which creates this huge level
of diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what Seth is talking about is
mutagenesis, like he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have your goal, the second thing
that you want to look for in a breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: program is finding the variability upon
which you can select and cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_04]: really remarkable plant being an
outcrosser because it has all this
[SPEAKER_04]: inherent variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can go through the genome and look
for special things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: every trait essentially exists on a
continuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have low cannabinoid producing plants,
we have high cannabinoid producing plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have tall plants and short plants,
high yielding plants and low yielding
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and essentially any trait that you
can characterize has this variability,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the CRISPR note though, CRISPR
allows us to do these special things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a couple of days ago they just
published a method in a rice variety for
[SPEAKER_04]: producing apomictic seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if anyone knows what
apomixis is but it's essentially an
[SPEAKER_04]: ability of a plant to produce a seed
without sexual combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might imagine that if we had an
apomictic cannabis line, it would produce
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds without pollination from an external
plant and all of the seeds would be
[SPEAKER_04]: identical with a parent plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's really valuable for mass
planting on fields and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there definitely is a use for these
technologies and I think that we will see
[SPEAKER_04]: them shortly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dave Watson is talking about how he
made specific strains with a single
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid, more for the pharmacological
aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: How relevant is that breeding program
these days with fractionless distillation
[SPEAKER_06]: as a viable option?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does a plant actually have to be a single
cannabinoid for the FDA to use it or can
[SPEAKER_06]: we use distillation techniques to get
those results?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can as long as they're present in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these compounds are not
present in certain plant lines and you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't make them express enough to get
economically viable total well content.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of this as well is making your plants
more economically efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a pure CBG line, it gives you
the opportunity to magnify that total
[SPEAKER_05]: compound based on how much people need.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're completely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chemistry and the
technological side of our industry is
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to catch up with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the combination of those two
things, plant breeding and technology,
[SPEAKER_05]: continues to make us more efficient than
yeast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to point out to you that we can do
all those things through chemistry and
[SPEAKER_04]: specific extractions with CO2 equipment or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's always more efficient if you have
a plant that already almost approaches
[SPEAKER_04]: your goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a plant that produces 99%
CBGA, for example, of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: fraction and the other 1% of that's THC or
CBG, there's less work to do by chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It saves labor, it saves costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of delivering your product to
market efficiently and on a cost efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: basis, it's better to have a plant that
does most of the work in the plant rather
[SPEAKER_04]: than have to go in through technology and
change it after the fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you happen to know the time frame of
that breeding program to get these
[SPEAKER_06]: results?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well Dave's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know all about that breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done through, it was actually
really the first program for centers of
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding programs that was conducted
through selfing technology and gynoaceous
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really only took a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you identify your targets,
you'd be surprised with gynoaceous
[SPEAKER_04]: matings, what you can do in a couple of
generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to caution the whole
distillation process only because from the
[SPEAKER_02]: analytical lab side, what we see is people
are, when you combine regulatory testing
[SPEAKER_02]: with distillation, you end up with a
situation where a lot of what you expect
[SPEAKER_02]: to see delta 9 is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turns into delta 8 or delta 10 or
whatever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly now you're not dealing with
the same compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So distillation does not necessarily also
get you what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one other element of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to just acknowledge that
thankfully we're on this panel and not the
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic cannabinoids panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately there really is a scaling of
yeast-produced cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wild to be at ICRS this year and
meet the team from India who could produce
[SPEAKER_03]: things very efficiently and
cost-effectively and to see the Kronos
[SPEAKER_03]: partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks and to
start to watch in the foaming these big
[SPEAKER_03]: swirling energies around synthetic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I promise they're really, it's very
easy to produce that scale, very pristine
[SPEAKER_03]: individual compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is I think all of us
share, and this movement really is
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing, a passion for the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: A passion for the way the plant,
through using technology and all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: tools that are available to us to
ultimately facilitate the best possible
[SPEAKER_03]: use and relationship of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just really want to appreciate and
celebrate that there's so many new tools
[SPEAKER_03]: that have arrived.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many brilliant people in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's a lot of clinical research
and other things that need to substantiate
[SPEAKER_03]: what these new plants and new ratios of
compounds can produce and quality of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe we're really going to change
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a faith in this every morning when
I go out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wake up, but it's mainly because I
get to sit near all of you.
I think our time is up.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
