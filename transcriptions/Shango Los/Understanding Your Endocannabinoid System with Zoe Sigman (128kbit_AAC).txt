[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, I'll make it much briefer this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Zoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, please save them
for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to make this really easy to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I talk too fast, let me know,
I'll slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, little history, simple context.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system has a very long
history, and we're going to shove it into
[SPEAKER_00]: three slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: First things first, evolutionary history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocannabinoid system is present
in all vertebrates, and it's present in
[SPEAKER_00]: more than just vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, components of the endocannabinoid
system have been found in everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: humans to fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the endocannabinoid system,
as we understand it now, it exists in all
[SPEAKER_00]: chordates, which is a specialized genus of
animals that includes vertebrates and also
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the C squirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not a vertebrate, it is very
squishy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chordates evolved around 530 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertebrates evolved around 525 million
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers are hesitant to put an exact
pinpoint on when the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system evolved, which is fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't actually have any way to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a little taste of how old this
system is.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was reading, one of my favorite
researchers, Dr. John McPartland,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had this lovely quote about the
evolution of the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just wanted to read to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, over evolutionary time, we see
duplications and mutations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid receptors and ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symbol for endocannabinoid evolution
is not a bifurcating tree, but an
[SPEAKER_00]: interweaving arabesque of co-evolving
receptors and ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that beautiful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into what all of those things
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just means, like, this system
evolved in many different species at many
[SPEAKER_00]: different times in many different ways for
many different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ended up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to slightly more modern
times, the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important in understanding why we
understand what we do and don't about the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 1964, Raphael Mchulam elucidated the
structure of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know, 1963, the structure of
CBD was elucidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, scientists thought that
the phytocannabinoids like THC worked
[SPEAKER_00]: through a non-specific membrane-associated
action, which is about as specific as it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had something to do with lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't really funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, in the 80s, NIDA was like,
marijuana is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's prove that it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's prove that it's bad by funding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what's bad about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that backfired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1988, in Dr. Alan Hallett's lab,
using NIDA funding, they discovered the
[SPEAKER_00]: first endocannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost three decades later,
they found the first endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were like, hmm, it's weird
that we have this thing in our bodies that
[SPEAKER_00]: only interacts with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why could that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they found the first
endocannabinoid a couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they found the second endocannabinoid
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they found the second
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've gone on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all to say, this is,
you know, like 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field of research is really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brings me to, I am not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research changes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a lot of it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear something and you're like,
that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, tell me because I won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, just know that it changes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of conflicting
information about this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I say something that sounds wrong,
let's explore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to where is the
endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because the
endocannabinoid system can do so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear about it being involved in all of
these different disease states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that has to do with where it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is found in the nervous system,
the immune system, and fat skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: bone, circulating cells, your digestive
system, your reproductive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to start with, does anyone
know what the nervous system does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it makes you nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Ethan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an excellent description of what
the nervous system does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the way that our body communicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It communicates and regulates a lot of
other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two parts to the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the central nervous system,
which is your brain and your brain stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the peripheral nervous
system, which is all of the nerves that
[SPEAKER_00]: run throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the central nervous system is like the
communication hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It receives signals from all over the body
and then it sends out other signals
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the body what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It organizes all that information and
regulates everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peripheral nervous system is
responsible for communicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: information to and from the central
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because the nervous
system does things like regulate our
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing or our heart beating or us
looking at our arm and being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to open my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your nervous system at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other system that's super important
when we talk about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the immune system, pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are pretty familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every winter with our immune systems and
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just make us feel really
shitty for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is they are trying to protect us from
invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a bunch of different parts
of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts that we're particularly
interested in for the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system are the B and T cells, which are
like the worrier cells of the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go around your body and they're like,
you, invader, die, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also bone marrow, really important in the
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is also in your
bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reason that when we talk
about cannabis and cannabis being
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic for a number of different
things that are really not very closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related, this is one of the reasons it
could be therapeutic for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many places that it
could interact throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the endocannabinoid system has
been expressed in every organ and in every
[SPEAKER_00]: system that's been looked at so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the exception of there's a
respiratory center in our brain and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is in most parts of our brain,
not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question you've all been waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start using ECS for endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of words on this screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also, you know, it's a really
good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the
endocannabinoid system as it's classically
[SPEAKER_00]: understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of information about the
endocannabinoid system that is evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll touch on that at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for today, we're going to talk about
the two classical endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptor type 1, CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptor type 2, CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're endogenous ligands, which are the
compounds that our body creates to bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: those receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the enzymes that synthesize and
metabolize those ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the enzymes that like give
birth to and break down the compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to the endocannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into each one of those
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of other parts to the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch on all of that at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on these three parts,
starting with receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question is near and dear to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started at a dispensary because I needed
a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was applying PhD programs in sociology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had like two days of training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked out of my science training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, we have an endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some receptors on the cells
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what a receptor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is a receptor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a neuron?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when the rabbit hole
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what image I put first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of a receptor,
an actual image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an illustration of a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is important because
oftentimes people will just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's like this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it actually looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A receptor is a tiny protein on the
surface of a cell that compounds engage
[SPEAKER_00]: with to tell the cell to do something or
to not do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow compounds to have impacts on
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four families of receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that we're going to be talking
about tonight are G protein coupled
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 and CB2 are both GPCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gobbledygook.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does matter is GPCRs are the target
of like 40% of medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really widespread throughout your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are one of the oldest families of
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB1 is one of the most common G
protein coupled receptors in our brains,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is a little illustration that
I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very good, but it does the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CB1 and CB2 are widely expressed
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we've got central nervous
system, the peripheral nervous system
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let's just go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptor type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to focus on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that picture of the receptor is a CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: G protein coupled receptors have seven
protein strands that go from the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cell to the inside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When compounds bind to the receptor,
they bind right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the receptor change a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of chemistry happens,
and it makes the cell go.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 receptors are most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevalent and most densely populated in
the brain, and in many, many areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain that are responsible for memory,
reward systems, attention, emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of what we focus on when we
talk about CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 is what makes you feel high when you
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very important receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first one discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it plays a major role in pain
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why THC can help some people feel
less pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to do that by altering our
emotional perception of pain, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of interesting and might explain why
some people feel more pain, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to notice it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually killing the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's also present on the olfactory
bulb, in the reproductive system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to cannabinoid receptor type 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited that I found a picture of
this receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was looking for a picture of this
receptor a couple years ago, one wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found one, and it was through
Creative Commons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just seven protein strands again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's actually a CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has something binding in it,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That green thing is where a compound
binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptors are three-dimensional shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three-dimensional shapes bind to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those three-dimensional shapes are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when those shapes come together and
change, they have different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 is most prevalent in our immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's found on B cells in our immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really important in regulating
inflammation throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 does not make us feel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is of particular interest to many,
many researchers who want to tap into the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of cannabis without feeling high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, and this is really
controversial, CB2 was thought to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the brain at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some evidence to suggest that
it is present in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might serve an immunoprotective
function up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, very controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like where we're at with the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to endogenous ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endogenous ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo means within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligands means a compound that binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are compounds that bind to the
receptors found within our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endogenous is the opposite of exogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an exogenous ligand would be something
from outside of your body that binds to a
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A phytocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabinoid from plants would be an
exogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking at receptors and
ligands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like words, words,
words, words, words.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are actually really important
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made a little diagram explaining
what they are as Star Wars characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptors tell the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells do specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know why they do those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just do the things that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't do those things without
some motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that motivation comes in the form of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Star Wars characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the cell's action
restores balance to the force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the whole premise of Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope everyone can see this movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's analogy really doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luke Skywalker, our hero of the moment,
would be an agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an agonist is a compound that binds to
a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells the cell to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Luke Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to restore balance to the force
by activating the receptor on the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that would be an
antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an antagonist binds to the receptor
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tells the cell, don't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also nothing else can bind here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing can activate you more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a little harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if the movies didn't get
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like if Luke didn't get funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he just stayed on his farm with his
aunt and uncle forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be really important for when a
system is overactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to calm it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can introduce an antagonist to a
system and make the receptors chill the
[SPEAKER_00]: heck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have allosteric modulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agonists and antagonists bind to the
primary binding site on a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, is in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes other compounds will bind to
other sites on the side of the receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll change the shape of the
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't activate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do when they change the
shape is they can make things that bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: it work more or less well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when something changes the shape of a
receptor and makes it work better with the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that bind and activate it,
it's called a positive allosteric
[SPEAKER_00]: modulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this compound is changing the shape of
the receptor to allow things that bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: it to work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that, which is kind of
like Emperor Palpatine in this movie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't include him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a negative allosteric modulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that binds to the side
of the receptor, changes the shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it harder for things to bind to the
receptor and they work less well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why CBD makes you feel less high
if you've taken too much THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a negative allosteric modulator at
CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the shape, THC binds less well,
you feel less high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also included synthesizing enzymes just
to continue on the road towards explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a synthesizing enzyme would be an
enzyme that triggers the creation of those
[SPEAKER_00]: ligands in the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like responsible for giving birth
to the agonist or antagonist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, Princess Leia, if she didn't
send that message, Luke would have never
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never would have gone and done the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she is kind of responsible for like the
whole thing being born, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a ligand though.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and then as a bonus,
we have Darth Vader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's an inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't really get much into inverse
agonists in this particular presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is another important function that
compounds can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if an agonist activates the cell and
tells the cell, do your thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: go and do it, an inverse agonist does the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells the cell, do the opposite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cell wants to usually go to the
right, an inverse agonist will be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what happens in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get inverse agonism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in addition to all of these things,
binaries are all false, including how
[SPEAKER_00]: things bind to receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something doesn't just simply bind
and tell the cell to go, they can bind
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less well, which is why L-steroid
modulation is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compounds in and of themselves have a
binding affinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a scale from a partial agonist
to a full agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because THC and one
of the endocannabinoids are partial
[SPEAKER_00]: agonists at the endocannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things are full agonists at the
cannabinoid receptors, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important when you're looking at
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of research that's done in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't done using THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done using a synthetic cannabinoid,
oftentimes Win55, which is a full agonist
[SPEAKER_00]: at CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good stand-in, not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so partial agonist, full agonist,
partial antagonist, full antagonist,
[SPEAKER_00]: allosteric modulation, synthesizing
enzyme, lots of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're gonna move on to
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so endocannabinoids are compounds
that our bodies produce that bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over a dozen that have been
discovered so far, but we really only know
[SPEAKER_00]: about two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the first two discovered,
anandamide or AEA, and two-aracadenyl
[SPEAKER_00]: glycerol, which I like to say because I
had to learn how to say it, or 2-H-E,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what everyone calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to include the images of the
three-dimensional shape of the molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: just to highlight again that these are
three-dimensional shapes binding in
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they can bind more or less
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a little candy cane shape in
the receptor and that little candy cane
[SPEAKER_00]: goes in there perfectly, it is a full
agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not quite a perfect candy
cane, it's just a little bit of a candy
[SPEAKER_00]: cane that still kind of goes in there and
activates it just a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a partial agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how you can go for a run,
some of you, some of us, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a little while, the first mile,
the first 30 minutes, you start to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, but only for a little while,
that's a runner's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have shown that after 30 minutes
or more of running, men experienced a
[SPEAKER_00]: doubling of anandamide in their brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this compound, anandamide, is probably
responsible for the runner's high,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that a runner's high lasts a
very, very short amount of time is that
[SPEAKER_00]: when endocannabinoids are released,
their enzymes to break them down are also
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're starting to be broken down
like immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very short effects, but still very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide is, Sanskrit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means supreme joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual name of the molecule means
what it feels like, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2AG, second compound, compound found
seems to be more expressed in more tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: at higher concentrations than anandamide,
and they often play opposing roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one of them does one thing,
it is anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the case for, I'm gonna make
it up, I talk about it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anandamide is largely
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2AG can be pro-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about why that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna put that out there, that these
two compounds are both ligands of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors, they both bind and
activate the cannabinoid receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can have opposing effects,
which is important when we talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system does on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, metabolic enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, oh, that wasn't supposed to,
okay, well, there's a whole list of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds you don't really need to know
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important are the catabolic
enzymes, which are the enzymes that break
[SPEAKER_00]: these two endocannabinoids down,
pha and magl, maglipase, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're released at the same time as the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break them down, they eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you adjust the levels of those enzymes,
you end up adjusting the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, and that's some of how
this medicine works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about the
endocannabinoids, these three parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptors, the endocannabinoids,
and the enzymes that synthesize them and
[SPEAKER_00]: break them down, work in concert
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you change one of those three parts,
you will end up with changes in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It balances itself, and so these are all
therapeutic targets for medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are different research projects
going on manipulating each one of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is the important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really hard question to answer,
especially breaking it down in rash
[SPEAKER_00]: generalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about earlier, the
endocannabinoid system is expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere in the body, and it does a lot
of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, it seems to encourage the
body to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it regulates systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a thermostat, and I stole this
metaphor from Martin Lee, my boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocannabinoid system is like a
master thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes all the information from the
different systems, and it makes sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the systems are running in concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was saying about the pro and
anti-inflammatory effect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids earlier, that plays
directly into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know when you get a fever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body is trying to kill the germs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that they don't take
root in your body and take over,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it raises the temperature, tries to
kill the germs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, okay, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germs die, but your body can't stay
hot forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your cells will die, which also
results in death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be a system to bring
that system down, to bring the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like that, but everywhere,
with every system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super interesting to try and research
any of this online, because it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and the gut,
the endocannabinoid system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory system, the endocannabinoid
system and the reproductive system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just like, it does this
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to illustrate this, I decided to
look at two conditions and talk about what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with the endocannabinoid system in
those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the primary things that
it is thought that the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system regulates in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammation is implicated in a lot of
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neurodegenerative diseases might be
related to inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoimmune diseases might be related to
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finding new, like novel,
ways to reduce inflammation is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the endocannabinoid system presents a
really awesome therapeutic target for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First things first, CB1 modulates pain
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I said earlier about it changing your
emotional perception of pain, super
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't seem to have much of a role
to play in inflammation, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2, on the other hand, really seems to
play a major role in modulating
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When anandamide and 2-AG binds to it,
they can have those opposing effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that is important to
note now, as before, is it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a compound that activates only one
of these two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get CB1 activation,
you also get CB2 activation and vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of research is being done to look
for a CB2 agonist that doesn't activate
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we're still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they do that, scientists are going to
lose their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons that we know CB2 has
an impact on inflammation is they designed
[SPEAKER_00]: a mouse that didn't have CB2 receptors,
which is something that researchers do
[SPEAKER_00]: with mice all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They delete different receptors or systems
or whatever in order to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those mice had such elevated levels of
inflammation that they ended up having
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue damage and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CB2 seems to be very important in
regulating inflammation throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.
Two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually, I wanted to touch on,
no, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metabolism and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another really interesting thing
that I guess like every system is an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting system that the
endocannabinoid system interacts with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is another really interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocannabinoid system starts
developing in fetuses really early on by
[SPEAKER_00]: week 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids play a role in embryo
implantation in the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a baby is born,
endocannabinoids play a role in suckling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide is found in breast milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take anandamide out of breast
milk, mouse pups in the mouse model just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't settle and they died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endocannabinoid system is really
important from the very beginning for
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CB1 seems to be the real star of this
whole aspect of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It modulates every aspect of feeding from
like finding food to the eating of food to
[SPEAKER_00]: the processing of food to feeling
satiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CB1 is implicated in all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 seems to oppose those effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another of those like
homeostatic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 does one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 does the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the endocannabinoids does one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other endocannabinoid does another
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CB1 really seems to be important in
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were hungry and we look at food,
the endocannabinoids in our system go way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start going up like slowly over the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we look at something we want to
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just like pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start to go slowly down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when this system is dysregulated,
you end up with disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namely, obesity on the one hand or
anorexia on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are obese will have the same
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a spike of endocannabinoids
when they see food that they want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't, they don't like go down as
quickly or as much as people normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that could mean like maybe they're
not feeling satiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still feel hungry even though they
shouldn't be hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not satisfying in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, people with anorexia
are shown food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's even their favorite food.
[SPEAKER_00]: No spike in endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat no spike in endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like they obviously aren't
having a pleasure reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eating food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manipulating the endocannabinoid system
could be a really good therapeutic target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it can have downstream
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a drug, remonabant,
which blocked the CB1 receptor that was
[SPEAKER_00]: approved for treating obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was approved and then quickly
withdrawn from the market for negative
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects like suicidality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as simple as just like
introducing something that blocks one or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a complex system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do one thing, it does that
everywhere and can have really negative
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it can have really
positive side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably most important to you guys,
what do you do with all this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of letters and numbers and
words how do you impact your system?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you impact your endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the obvious answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about how
cannabinoids interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is the most common cannabinoid
found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that many of you probably
enjoyed tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is binding to both the CB1 and CB2
receptor throughout your body and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some really cool things like making you
feel high and maybe making you feel less
[SPEAKER_00]: pain or less nauseous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like just better in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does some really, really cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, on the other hand, does not bind to
CB1 or CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a negative allosteric modulator at
CB1, which is how it makes you feel less
[SPEAKER_00]: high if you've had too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has an impact on a lot of different
receptors and channels throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: body, which is where we start getting into
the non-classical endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CB1 and CB2 are a super small part of
the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably one of the most
important ones is the TRIP family of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRIPV1, the vanilla receptor, which is
what capsaicin binds to in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD also binds to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it binds to and affects a lot of
different TRIP receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRIP receptors modulate temperature
sensation throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it could be really effective for
helping with pain, just like capsaicin
[SPEAKER_00]: cream is effective for dealing with pain,
but without that burning feeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the TRIP family of receptors isn't
currently considered to be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, though that might
be changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other ways to manipulate your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's cannabimimetic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fun word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means compounds that act like
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Russo actually wrote a paper
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of compounds found in a
lot of different plants that activate one
[SPEAKER_00]: or another of the CB receptors or affect
the enzymes that break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betacaryophylline is probably the most
interesting of these compounds because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a selective CB2 agonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking earlier about how things are
not selectively activating CB1 or CB2,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they activate one, they activate the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Betacaryophylline seems to only activate
CB2, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does that at really high dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels they were looking at were like
25 to 50 milligrams per kilogram,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 1,200 to 3,000 milligrams of
betacaryophylline in order to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's in mice and not in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another compound found in
black pepper that I'm not even going to
[SPEAKER_00]: try and pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pha inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pha breaks down anandamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's released at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide is responsible for the runner's
high, makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pha breaks it down, gets rid of that
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you inhibit pha, anandamide sticks
around for longer, which means you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good for longer, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So black pepper, again, getting both of
those compounds, which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People looked at a bunch of different
plants to look for cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid-like compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found one in kava kava.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to activate the CB1 receptor,
which makes sense if you've ever had kava
[SPEAKER_00]: kava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely makes you feel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not as high as, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maka, pha inhibitor, does that thing
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide sticks around for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, echinacea, one of the
compounds in it is a CB2 agonist,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it activates those
immunomodulatory effects throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: body that CB2 is responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be partially responsible for
why echinacea can be effective as an
[SPEAKER_00]: immune booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that you can impact your
endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: electroacupuncture, which is not the most
common form of acupuncture, but still
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly common, will boost levels of
endocannabinoids in your system pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress reduces endocannabinoids in your
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a direct correlation between
cortisol and endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome for Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you reverse stress, you will start
to elevate your levels of endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like meditation and yoga could
help bring endocannabinoids back up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: level that is healthy, as opposed to where
most of us probably live, which is far too
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, interestingly, massage doubled the
amount of anandamide found circulating in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body, which was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just someone getting really
deep into those muscles that feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually your brain being like,
feel happy, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, get a massage.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, other considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid dome, which really
rolls off the tongue, endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: dome, or as Martin likes to say,
the endocannabidiome, which actually does
[SPEAKER_00]: roll off the tongue, is that larger system
of receptors and compounds and enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabinoids, endo and plant-based
cannabinoids, interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just CB1 and CB2, but the TRIP
family of receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the opioid receptors,
mu and delta opioid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD interacts with them, modulates them,
makes the opioids, either endo or
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic, work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPAR, there's a bunch of different
receptors also found throughout your body
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for a lot of different things
that cannabinoids interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GPCRs, there are three GPCRs that are
all claimed to be the next CB3 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll see which one actually wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: GPR55 is particularly interesting,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in, it regulates bone
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an overexpression of GPR55 is found in
people with osteoporosis, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, CBD is an antagonist at
GPR55, so it can help bring that down,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, THC seems to be an
agonist at GPR55.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you win some, you lose some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then GPR18, another really interesting
cannabinoid receptor potentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually THC has a stronger affinity
for GPR18 than it does for CB1 or CB2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it could be a receptor responsible for
the anti-nausea effects that THC is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of famous for, at least in the
chemotherapy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This term is thrown around a lot now,
and basically it refers to the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, ligands, and enzymes that are
circulating throughout your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to be aware that this is a
term that's thrown around, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly defined in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there is likely like a good
level for all of those things to be at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if things are overexpressed or
underexpressed, then you get
[SPEAKER_00]: dysregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a dysregulated endocannabinoid system
results in disease most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that was a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this question all the time,
like, where do I learn more?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of resources
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD is one of the only ones that's
relatively accessible for people without a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific background, and I had that on
my presentation before I worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use PubMed and ResearchGate,
which are the databases of scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: white papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those things are open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually want to dig into the
science of it, I highly recommend going to
[SPEAKER_00]: PubMed and checking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you can read online for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really amazing resource,
and your tax dollars fund a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: research projects, so read about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some researchers to keep an eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start reading a bunch of
research, names pop up again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan, you introduced me to the
endocannabinoid system, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Ethan Russo, Dr. John Parling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are sort of like in order of
accessibility, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vincenzo de Marzo has written extensively
about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's based in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rafael Machulam, actually a really
accessible writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy who elucidated the structure
of THC in 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: C.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hillard, Alan Howlett, both amazing
researchers who have written extensively
[SPEAKER_00]: about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, have many slides.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we've got time for a handful
of questions.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hard to not see people when you're
talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we've got time for a handful
of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, Susie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked into myrcine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of theories about how
myrcine, like, thins the blood-brain
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier or makes THC work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not substantiated in the
literature, which is not to say that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no research to support it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you know what it does do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Has that research not just really been
done yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of the research on terpenes is
based on aromatherapy studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are studies where a small amount
of a terpene is distributed into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: of a room, and then people are asked how
they feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we know, like, linalool is
calming because it's the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene in lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of studies looking at
how terpenes interact with our bodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmacology, like, what they do when
they get in our bodies, but they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't actually know a lot about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of theories about
terpenes, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just asked because, as a grower,
I found that plants that had a high
[SPEAKER_06]: percentage of both karyophylline and
myrcine together had a very specific
[SPEAKER_06]: happy, giggly effect on people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like, it's one of those things where
I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, like, definitely a correlation
between effect and the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: constellation, but that research isn't
public yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, in the back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take a large amount of THC and a
large amount of CBD at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the THC's not necessarily up taking
the way it should because of the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: if over a period of time, is the THC being
broken down at all while that's happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it being stored and up taking it
slower until the CBD goes away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so CBD can extend the duration of
a high, for sure, but I'm not sure about
[SPEAKER_00]: the metabolism of large amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anecdotally, it would appear that
somehow it's being stored in the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: not broken down, although that... Yeah,
the enzymes that break down THC in the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver do so in small packets, but I'm not
sure what the pace of that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're all big fans of whole plant
medicine here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but CBD is not really produced
whole plant in the market very well,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either people are manufacturing it and
they're extracting the CO2, which is no
[SPEAKER_05]: longer a whole plant, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so THC is abundant and cheap,
but CBD is less so because everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: growing THC for the rec side, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So now though, we've got all the CBD
coming in from the medical hip market,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people are finding kind of a
tweener to take their regular THC-based
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine and then spike it with CBD from
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: How similar is taking CBD and spiking your
whole plant like ethanol hash oil,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How close to whole plant does that get as
far as efficacy goes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would get pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would depend on... Because
whole plant medicine changes from plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it would depend on what you're
extracting it from and sort of what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds are of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like a whole plant extract,
like adding CBD to a whole plant extract
[SPEAKER_00]: still retains all of the wonderful effects
of the whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a CBD-based whole plant extract,
you would hope that all of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're already taking are in that
extract as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be pretty similar,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely worth using.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question is whether or not the
supporting novel cannabinoids of CBD are
[SPEAKER_05]: also in that other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it does seem like THC and CBD
have a particularly synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, there was a study that is
being done at Harvard, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this study a while ago about
public speaking and how CBD impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety induced by public speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was effective, but the doses were
like 300 and 600 milligrams, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people would always cite that study
as being like, oh, CBD is an anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, no one's taking 300
milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But C.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gruber at Harvard is in the middle of a
study where she used 30 milligrams of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and like 0.3 milligrams of THC and found
anti-anxiety effects for both chronic and
[SPEAKER_00]: acute anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though it's hard to get in the
market so far, we've actually been doing
[SPEAKER_05]: patient studies all summer on CBG,
which has a fantastic anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_05]: component.
[SPEAKER_05]: But specifically for social anxiety and
public speaking, it makes you feel capable
[SPEAKER_05]: like you can handle this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first real commercial of CBG is
being grown this summer, and it'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere this fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: So watch for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Obama.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would submit that full plant,
full spectrum describes the workflow more
[SPEAKER_03]: than the plant material used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can mix one part cannabis,
one part hemp to a full spectrum whole
[SPEAKER_03]: plant work overall, whether it's ethanol
or what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that whole plant describes
what material you're using, but an attempt
[SPEAKER_03]: to pull cannabinoids, terpenes,
flavonoids, and everything else out of
[SPEAKER_03]: there as part of a whole synergetic pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing you mentioned,
CBG.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any idea what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I specifically came to this seminar to
learn about something that might be useful
[SPEAKER_07]: for the exact application you described.
[SPEAKER_07]: For anxiety and public speaking and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not for me, because I can tell a joke if
you like.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to explain CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is the parent cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all other cannabinoids, most other
cannabinoids that develop in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: developed from CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabigerol is what it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in higher quantities in
immature plants, although now there are
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders who are growing plants that will
only express CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a secondary cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly well studied yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have anecdotally anti-anxiety
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also being looked at for its
anti-nausea effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of what I've seen in the
literature about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helps with neuromuscular pain
we're finding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the studies that we did on Bashon this
summer, it's really crazy because we get
[SPEAKER_05]: this lightning of neuromuscular pain and
an increase of the feeling of capability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can overcome this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which somehow also helps with the pain,
and they're together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, again, it's all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just us making up ethanol hash oil,
handing it out with questionnaires.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD is definitely also a compound of
interest for anxiety, and one that has
[SPEAKER_00]: more substantial scientific literature
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that can be without a PhD component,
or a very minor one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, although you might need a very minor
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you use an isolative CBD
regardless of condition, you might need
[SPEAKER_00]: much more larger dose than taking
something that has a small amount of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or a full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anybody trying to make some
medication for anti-inflammatory that can
[SPEAKER_04]: help with anti-inflammatory, I guess?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, similar context.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like I should stay away from
something that would be the opposite of
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one point I didn't actually touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All phyto-cannabinoids have been shown to
be anti-inflammatory, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only endocannabinoids have both effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And researchers don't really know why
phyto-cannabinoids, plant-based
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, don't have a
pro-inflammatory effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem like they've only had an
anti-inflammatory effect on every cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not worry too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
So isn't that looking into evolutionary
changes to the plant for making all these
wonderful things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to write an article about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids are terpenofenolic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically terpenes, which might
have evolved for a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all expressed in the trichomes
on the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes also evolved for maybe a couple
of different things, potentially to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect against the sun, potentially to
protect against pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of terpenes are bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these compounds, cannabinoids
included, are in a family of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are very commonly produced by plants
to regulate a lot of systems, like growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and cell life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's any number of reasons that they
might have produced them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: C.
Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: About, I want to say, oh, it's like seven
years ago now.
The academic community was about one
protein motif away from having fully
documented the metabolic pathway to create
VHC and CBD and all the other
cannabinoids.
Have you seen any research where they
found that final protein motif?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have literally no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Susie, but she did already ask
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're pressing, we can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we'll go to Susie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the rain coming, if we were
interested in trying to get some CBG,
[SPEAKER_06]: how early do you think we could pick
things to try and get some CBG?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to pick too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you want your trichomes to
develop, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know this more than I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't actually worked with early
picked cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even think that homework's
been done yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only used plant material that has
been bred specifically to only express
[SPEAKER_05]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people have been actually doing that in
hemp culture right now a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Picking every week and running analytics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jerry, what is behind you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to know a lot more about
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to know a lot more about this
after this summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, so we are going to move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Zoe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Woo!
Woo!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
