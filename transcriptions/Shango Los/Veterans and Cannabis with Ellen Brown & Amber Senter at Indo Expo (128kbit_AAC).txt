[SPEAKER_02]: So the US cannabis industry is growing at
a rapid rate, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And US veteran advocates and entrepreneurs
are playing a big part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our panel this morning will focus on the
importance of veteran involvement in the
[SPEAKER_02]: shaping of this emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our guest speakers, Ellen Brown and
Amber Center, who will be with us
[SPEAKER_02]: momentarily, will discuss the genesis of
some of these veteran-led Thank you so
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go ahead and introduce
Amber now, and she'll just join the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation when she gets here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amber Center is founder of Leisure Life,
a lifestyle and infused cannabis products
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also co-founder of Super Noble
Women, formed in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: This organization is dedicated to
empowering people of color to become
[SPEAKER_02]: self-sufficient cannabis industry
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amber is a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast Guard veteran and a former COO of
Magnolia Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please put your phones on vibrate if
you haven't already done so, and please
[SPEAKER_02]: hold your questions until the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's offer Ellen, and when she comes
in Amber, a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get us started, I want to ask Ellen,
what aspects of your military experience
[SPEAKER_02]: especially prepared you for working in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Ellen Terry Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a United States Air Force veteran,
and what I did in the service was
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition, so nutritional airing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of my job was teaching one-on-one
classes, as well as teaching large classes
[SPEAKER_00]: for prenatal care, gestational diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you failed your PT test, I would be the
first person you would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was able to take away from that
was learning how to teach, learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do one-on-one patient counselling,
and how to create curriculum, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: found very much transferable to sentencing
at seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used my abilities to teach,
create educational material that was easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand, and then with that I've
been able to really perpetuate education
[SPEAKER_00]: on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that I was able to take
away from the military was being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find people that I could rely on and know
that my strengths would complement their
[SPEAKER_00]: weaknesses and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really putting myself out there and
finding my cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: much like my brother in arms, I have my
brothers in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine that the intimate role that
you played with interviewing soldiers who
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably not always as upfront about
their physical wellness as they could be,
[SPEAKER_02]: because weakness is shamed, and folks
always want to let their spirit officers
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that they're always 100%,
and you learned how to create that
[SPEAKER_02]: intimacy as well, which I can imagine is
important when working with veterans in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would do the one-on-one patient
counselling, people could be there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, for a variety of reasons,
and sometimes they were very receptive to
[SPEAKER_00]: the information I was going to impart on
them, whether or not that was setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional program, whether or not it was
them coming back weekly, biweekly,
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly, and with cannabis, it's that same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come in with a little bit of
trepidation, or when they come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to kind of pull out from them,
what do you want, what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just having patience and
understanding, especially from coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical field, because cannabis is a
medicine, you do have your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids, your CB1 receptor,
your CB2 receptor, which a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't as educated on as they would like,
so I've been able to teach them that
[SPEAKER_00]: information, and then have them go on to
be their own best advocates is really what
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to drive home, whether or not it
was teaching my nutritional classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we would sit down, and then you'd
come back and tell me how your results
[SPEAKER_00]: were when you were away, and with this,
I will give you all the tools you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to better understand your own
endocannabinoid system, your own
[SPEAKER_00]: self-titration dosing, what works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, as I'm saying, it is,
it's very much transferable for when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: creating those different nutritional plans
for people, now we're creating different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants for people, whether or not
it's, I have a four by four space with
[SPEAKER_00]: streams that I grow, or I have an outdoor
field in Maine, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sitting down and seeing what resources
we have, and then just growing from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that our industry has got a lot of
inside vocabulary, and certainly the
[SPEAKER_02]: military does as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that having a pre-existing
shared vocabulary with the veterans helps
[SPEAKER_02]: you bring them up to speed in cannabis,
because that vocabulary tends to cause
[SPEAKER_02]: them to warm up to you faster,
because they can tell that you have shared
[SPEAKER_02]: past experience with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found with veterans is kind of that
saying what's a Marine, always a Marine,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it was the Air Force,
and Amber was in the Coast Guard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people come from all different
branches, when you meet somebody who's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow service member, you feel almost an
immediate connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that they have something in
common with you that you don't have in
[SPEAKER_00]: common with maybe your spouse,
your friends, your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It connects you almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with cannabis, when you smoke that
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to form a relationship built
on trust because we both know we were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we're able to take
that a step further when we start to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about, hey, how was your
military service?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes veterans don't like to open
up because it's hard talking to civilians,
[SPEAKER_00]: or hard talking to people that don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a veteran talks to another
veteran, that nail just goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk shop, as it were,
and say, hey, this is why I'm medicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the problems I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it was like when I deployed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, it's really able to break
down that wall and get them to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what did, how was that experience for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some people did experience combat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do have PTSD, depending on
your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people did experience sexual trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the things that for being in
the Air Force and working in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: field, just being patient and
understanding and let people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: things in their own time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how much do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found that this helps you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing the best strains for you,
because with cannabis, sometimes the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: can have too much of a cerebral effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can actually help to exacerbate
this traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on your endocannabinoid
system, that might not be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing whether or not a sativa or an
indica is going to be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you medicating?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to medicate for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not medicating to suppress your
feelings, but medicating so that way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can start to form a new relationship with
how you feel about those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of pass those traumas, identify them,
and use cannabis to help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're really frontiering this new
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always like to really emphasize the
importance of the plant-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us, Amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already introduced you at the
beginning, so folks already know who you
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to deal you right in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, with your background
as a veteran, how are you able to leverage
[SPEAKER_02]: that experience from the service to better
serve veterans here in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal we're trying to get at is so
other people can emulate your experience
[SPEAKER_02]: and use their experience in the military
to also provide aid to their veteran
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers-in-arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was an ROTC kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an ROTC up through high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went through an office training
program when I was in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a veteran of the Coast Guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also the child of a combat
veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got Purple Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was injured several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely know firsthand,
even though I'm not a combat veteran,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing a PTSD from someone very close to
me, my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, you know, I've taken a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, when I was in the
military, I got a ton of leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's definitely helped me in the
cannabis industry to kind of discuss and
[SPEAKER_01]: not just discuss, but I would say take a
lot of issues that are difficult for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to maybe comprehend or understand
and bring those issues together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I co-founded a nonprofit organization
called Superdome Women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we empower people of
color to become self-sufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: shareholders in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that through education, advocacy,
and networking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of engaging with our local and city
and state officials, hosting workshops for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that even though my focus
has been not necessarily a veteran focus,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more women and people of color,
but a lot of the things and everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned, the training that I got in the
military has definitely helped me to push
[SPEAKER_01]: tough agendas forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also been, I suffer from lupus,
so I've been a very strong patient
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like all of those things have
really helped me, at least the military
[SPEAKER_01]: has helped me to gain the skills and
really helped to develop the skills that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to, like I just mentioned,
have pushed a lot of these issues and
[SPEAKER_01]: agendas forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as veterans in the military and how
I interact with them in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first interaction actually here in the
Bay, I moved here four years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I used to go to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for an edibles company,
so I was running around constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a dispensary that I used to go to all
the time that I really remember was the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp center in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dispensary had a ton of veterans
that used to hang out in the, it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: a dab area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had a lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a bunch of veterans used to just hang
out there, so I would go there all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and pass out edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just free edibles to all the veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a really good friend of mine also has
a veterans group, Operation EVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Ryan Miller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a veteran of the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hosts like a community type group
at different dispensaries around the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started actually at my dispensary,
Magnolia, here in West Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's really interesting to see
how people are trying to help veterans
[SPEAKER_01]: within the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, access to low cost or free
compassion medicine is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's an interesting thing to
point out that after other wars,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the wars that our grandparents
were in, when soldiers came back,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had places like the VFW halls to meet
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slowly that model, it isn't quite as
robust as it was for generations before
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everywhere I traveled, in the country,
you find all the huge value that vets get
[SPEAKER_02]: from the cannabis lounges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the cannabis itself can help a
whole range of symptoms they may need
[SPEAKER_02]: relief from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, it provides that
gathering place where you can share
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences with others, with people that
you trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in many ways, it's kind of,
it's supplanting what the VFW halls did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is probably a little bit on the
better side because it's around cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and not booze too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're both leaders of cannabis
companies and also leaders within your own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to know what programs do
either your businesses have or other
[SPEAKER_02]: programs that are in your scenes that you
find work most effectively to reach out to
[SPEAKER_02]: veterans and get them properly involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you know where I'm going with
this is a lot of people are going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: the video and they're going to feel
inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to want to start doing
things at their local, wherever they live
[SPEAKER_02]: in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my goal for this is for us to kind of
put some ideas in the ears of people in
[SPEAKER_02]: the audience of what they might be able to
do where they live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what have you both seen that seems to
be working effectively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get veterans involved,
the best thing to do is to go on a social
[SPEAKER_00]: media social media is becoming huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, hashtag veterans, hashtag free,
[SPEAKER_00]: hashtag education, hashtag cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start to get some traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New England for the longest time,
veterans didn't have any resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when somebody named Derek
Cloutier and Sean Judge formed the New
[SPEAKER_00]: England Veterans Alliance, which has been
operational for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now a registered nonprofit
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they've started to do is to hold
monthly meetings for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterans can come, we can smoke cannabis,
we can relax, enjoy each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've taken it a step further
where they reached out to me and they
[SPEAKER_00]: said, hey, Ellen, you do education,
you're a veteran, come on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is sometimes I'll hold free
educational classes for veterans or the
[SPEAKER_00]: classes that I'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will reach out to my network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your network is your network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you know and what can they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll reach out to like Magic Butter or
different seed companies that have helped
[SPEAKER_00]: me out like Homegrown Natural Wonders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one is the California
Seafolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll send me genetics and I'll give
them away to veterans for free as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can give things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do that with the medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can give things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I have a raffle for the money
that goes into the raffle, I'll take it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll give it right back to that
nonprofit organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Maine, there's the Homegrown Healthcare
of Maine started by Katherine Lewis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Glenn Lewis, and Shawna and what they do
is they also provide free classes for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Free classes for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself hold free classes for veterans in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Kana Health and we're going to
start holding monthly or quarterly free
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by providing them cannabis
education, providing them discounts or
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them the tools and the resources
they need to go further, that helps to
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen your cannabis community and it
helps to strengthen the veteran community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be a veteran to help
a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katherine, Shawna, and Glenn are not
veterans, but they do see the need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see how it has helped people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot be more thankful to the New
England Veterans Alliance, to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Homegrown Healthcare of Maine,
to Kana Health for recognizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans don't have anywhere to really go
in states that don't allow for lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to go meet in places and
smoke in parking lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not conducive to helping us not
feel like criminals or breaking that
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma and getting us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more we can do for veterans,
the more we can offer our veterans to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them succeed on their own is going to be
priceless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on the West Coast, you have 22
Too Many, which I love New England
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterans Alliance and I love all these
different organizations, but 22 Too Many
[SPEAKER_00]: has a special place in my heart because
they were one of the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick Saint is one of their founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are always at the Washington
State House.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got PTSD added to their medical
marijuana program in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Tetra Hydro Club in Rhode
Island, which has free days for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New Hampshire, there's not really
anything going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a conducive medical
program and they do not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with their medical marijuana program,
they didn't even have post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress disorder as a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when all the veterans got
together and we said, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to their state house for one
of their hearings and we all testified.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were about 10 of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our voices, with our service,
with our actual stories, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my life and I need this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to get post-traumatic
stress disorder added to the state of New
[SPEAKER_00]: Hampshire, which is huge because on the
East Coast, they're probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: furthest states back from being where they
need to be to have a functional medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're so far from having a
recreational program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting veterans involved and
especially getting veterans involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying is going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobbying and activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had times where people from different
organizations would call me and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I really need you to come to the
state house or I need you to testify X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, or Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because you're educated and also
you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a veteran voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I say, hi, my name is Ellen
Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a United States veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I notice people go like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I notice them start to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does she have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this young veteran have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So by being a veteran, your voice carries
just a little bit more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or because you're a veteran, maybe
somebody who wasn't as apt to listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to, oh, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what do you have to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you are a veteran,
they'll take the time to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that when you're speaking,
you're able to articulate that it's helped
[SPEAKER_00]: you and what it's going to be able to do
for other veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not just me taking care of
myself in Massachusetts and New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my taking care of the entire world
and every veteran who needs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you reply to that same question,
Amber, there's a couple of important
[SPEAKER_02]: things I think that are worthwhile to pull
out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, if you want to start veterans
programs in your area, don't be shy about
[SPEAKER_02]: asking for stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to help veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether or not you're getting free
medical marijuana for them, whether or not
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting growing products or tents
for them to grow in their homes,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not it's just access or free
tickets or tickets to an event or a sports
[SPEAKER_02]: event or anything, people want to help
veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to decide to help
veterans in your area, there's not many
[SPEAKER_02]: things that will attract sick veterans
better than letting them know that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be free cannabis provided for
them for their aches and pains when they
[SPEAKER_02]: arrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they're there, you can
continue on with the other services that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to make sure you give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The therapy, the community, the
information about their health and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of different ways to
go about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So same kind of idea to you, Amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in a different scene than Ellen
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you've already said, your work
certainly touches on veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more specifically, minorities and
women and others who may be even farther
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the mainstream and have even more
unique needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of programs do you see being
offered that you're finding to be
[SPEAKER_02]: effective that other people might be able
to model elsewhere in the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we mentioned before and kind of
talked about, camaraderie is a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, obviously, in the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: You develop some friendships and
relationships that last for a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things are very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through all kinds of experiences
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important for people to
get together and discuss and share,
[SPEAKER_01]: like at the VFW.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since those things, as we spoke about,
are kind of blundering away, creating
[SPEAKER_01]: these support groups for people to come
together and share their stories is still
[SPEAKER_01]: very vital and very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So groups like Operation Evac,
like I mentioned before, that's a Bay Area
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They meet at a couple different
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They meet at even seven stars right here
in Richmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get together and just kind of
discuss and talk about the issues that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're having, issues that they're
facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just being a veteran and navigating
civilian life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important just
because lots of these folks are very
[SPEAKER_01]: lonely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not get out for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be PTSD issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So supporting those types of groups is
really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving them the resources that they need,
whether it be free cannabis, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in California, actually, I believe
they just passed an amendment to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation saying that some groups like
Operation Evac can now have a compassion
[SPEAKER_01]: program to turn around and give veterans
free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was something that we couldn't do
before, but it was lobbied for by the
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So advocacy is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism and advocacy is really key in
getting these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought that they would
have come out with regulations saying you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't give away cannabis anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really important, but that
only happened because veterans spoke up
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, to go off of what Ellen was saying,
Santa Cruz Veterans Alliance is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got a chance to go down there
and tour their facilities and meet those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about three weeks ago, so that was
a really awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was one of the nicest facilities
I've ever been in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh yeah, they're ready for
inspection in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's some of the best flowers I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some of the best prices I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out the door, eights for 45 bucks,
top shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not finding that anywhere else in
the bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also going to support those
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz Veterans Alliance, they're
dispensary to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's run and supported by mainly veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important for us to
support those types of organizations as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in the room, but you don't
live really local here to California,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you are watching this video after
the event, at home, you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go to Santa Cruz to learn from
these groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go online and Google their names,
and take a look at their flyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out how they describe their events,
what vocabulary that they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn from how other groups
advertise, how you may want to advertise
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to reach your particular
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up to this point, we've talked about
how as a veteran, those skills help you
[SPEAKER_02]: outreach to all people, but specifically
veterans especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we turned that into, okay,
so what kinds of programs are beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: for veterans?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let's take that one step farther,
because I know that veterans themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: are very involved with shaping how
cannabis is evolving as an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why don't we start with Amber this
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Amber, what are some of the roles that
you have seen veterans in in cannabis that
[SPEAKER_02]: they are using their experience and skills
they picked up in the service,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they are making major moves in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea here is to inspire other
veterans who may be watching, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, but I don't know how to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some really awesome
veterans right now in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanda James of Colorado, she's one of the
very few black women dispensary owners in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, I believe, I don't think she's the
only one down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's the only one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was a naval officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually, I've been running into
people more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met someone who's a GM of a really big
grow facility, and also processing
[SPEAKER_01]: facility in Monterey, and he was a naval
seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, my buddy Ryan
Miller, he was in the Marine Corps,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he heads up this group, Operation
Evac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend down in LA, Jay Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been working to kind of organize a
lot of the POC, people of color,
[SPEAKER_01]: women veterans, and she's down in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, there's a lot of veterans that
are taking lead in, I mean, running
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Running companies in leadership positions,
but that's no surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, veterans get the best leadership
training, so I would just expect us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaders in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like veterans should just not
be shy about taking their shot,
[SPEAKER_02]: because whatever they're interested in,
you take that with the training that
[SPEAKER_02]: they've already acquired, and it will very
likely pop them to the top of their scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of the folks who are coming
from other scenes may not have that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, and they don't share the same
values.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start reciting values and stuff,
some people laugh at me and think I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: corny, but I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things that I've learned,
honor, courage, devotion to duty,
[SPEAKER_01]: respect, all these things, I mean,
I carry them throughout everything that I
[SPEAKER_01]: do, and I learned all these core values
when I was in the military, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like, once you get these
core values and you incorporate them into
[SPEAKER_01]: your everyday life, how can you not be a
leader?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna change the question just a
little bit for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just talked about how the kind of
leadership veterans generally are,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I know that both of you are very
focused on giving female veterans the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources, the connections, the
introductions, sometimes probably just the
[SPEAKER_02]: encouragement to go for it, and so for
folks who are very interested in helping
[SPEAKER_02]: promote female veterans in the Canada
scene, what are some of the programs that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have seen nationally that seem to be
effective in doing that, that folks might
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to emulate locally where they
live?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is I have not seen any
just primarily female folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: focused advocacy groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of a wave,
and then there's kind of a die-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterans make up about 7% of the
population, and female veterans are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 2% of that percentage,
so it's a small percent of a small
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with this panel for females
in the cannabis industry as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans, I put something on social media
saying, I'd love to get some more female
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans involved, and I'm so glad Amber's
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Amber was one of the only veterans who
was a female veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of male veterans in the
cannabis space, and then she was a woman
[SPEAKER_00]: of color here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect, but it was Amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I put it online,
everybody had maybe one person,
[SPEAKER_00]: two people they could name, but you
couldn't name like 10, 15 women in a row
[SPEAKER_00]: that are female cannabis advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, I definitely think
there's a need, and even going through it
[SPEAKER_00]: and realizing that I don't have a roster
of female veterans I could call upon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Amber, you're now on there, but knowing
who your female veterans are and then what
[SPEAKER_00]: they advocate for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's Meek Monique,
and she is a breast cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's down in Southern California,
and she started Meekware, so she does a
[SPEAKER_00]: line of apparel and then gives back to
veterans in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Sarah Stauffner, and what she does
is she's an advocate in New York City,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she just got a license to cultivate
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she got a farm, and she's going to
start putting together programs for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans to come and cultivate,
to have a place to talk, to have a place
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to learn a skill set,
and then be also have a family and a
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that they don't have a purpose
now, but some veterans, once they get out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the service and go back in the civilian
world, they kind of isolate themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: very much, so they don't even know where
to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having programs like what Sarah's going
to put together is going to be crucial for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting people back out of the house,
helping them reacclimate, and when she
[SPEAKER_00]: started to put together that program,
she called me and she said, Ellen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need help with grow classes,
so I'm going to be facilitating those grow
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, and if we need business,
we're going to call our good friend Amber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we need apparel, we're going to
call Monique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the cannabis community,
the female veterans are kind of starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out who each other, who we are,
what skill sets we have, and how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: work together, because there's absolutely
strength in numbers, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely strength when we have a unified
voice, a unified veteran voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's just females or males
or all together, we're unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get together and we put our minds
to something, I really loved how you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out the core values in the Air
Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our core values are integrity first,
service before self, and excellence in all
[SPEAKER_00]: we do, and I've absolutely carried those
values over into my cannabis work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that there is that
idea of integrity first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not telling veterans, come to these
classes, and you'll take that cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll cure your PTSD, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell about their own endocannabinoid
system, dosing, I give them resources so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to better take care of
themselves with the service before self.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about promoting Ellen Brown,
it's about promoting the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, the veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that the focal point of
everything I'm doing is to not to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight myself, but to highlight the
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And excellence first before self,
excellence in all we do, and just making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that those core values have really
stayed firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that once you go into the
military, I don't know what the other core
[SPEAKER_00]: values are for the Coast Guard and the
Marines, but I know that we all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have an amount of camaraderie where we
know that we've all been taught to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: right thing in such a way that it's
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a part of who I am and a
part of the way I address people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you need another veteran,
especially another female veteran,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can almost always tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our posture, the way we hold
ourselves, the way we sit up straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way that we take the time and
we're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how Amber has so much passion
for what she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a female veteran and then she takes
that a step further and she goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how can I help my minority brothers
in arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I help this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I do a business?
[SPEAKER_00]: So she found that business was the best
avenue for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that education and advocacy
has been my best avenue to really help
[SPEAKER_00]: propel those other veterans and to get
them where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veterans usually are very self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need a lot, but once you have
that support system and you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: unstoppable, I think you kind of become
unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thrives with more support.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for certain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, something that's really
interesting that came out there is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in so much of the cannabis
industry, there are more people than there
[SPEAKER_02]: are opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more people who want Bud Tender
jobs than can get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more people who are running
businesses than there is room for those
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our industry is going to have quite a
shakeout, but from what I'm hearing,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you are a woman veteran, there's a
dearth of you in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you should feel encouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the fact that, oh my gosh,
all your friends are saying there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: jobs in the industry or there's no room
for you to start a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, clearly there are resources
available to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want you to play in the sandbox and
the likelihood of sharing their toys
[SPEAKER_02]: increases, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, I'm sorry to interrupt
you, but a lot of businesses are
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivized to hire veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even know that if you're applying for a
dispensary license in Merced, which is in
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Valley in California, you get
extra points if you're a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is coming hit to how the
issues that veterans face, how veterans
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be included in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And figuring out some pretty creative ways
to add veterans into the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just raise your hand and then expect to
be aggressively recruited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an inspiring thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're reaching the end of our time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably have time for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do we have a question from the
audience that anybody wants to give our
[SPEAKER_02]: panel before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so not immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sometimes happens with morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the morning, everybody's still tucked
into their coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's end with one more question just
about for the veterans who have been
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to the panel today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've shaken some things loose for
them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're suddenly saying, oh, maybe there's
some opportunity for me either to
[SPEAKER_02]: participate in the cannabis industry,
either starting a company or working on a
[SPEAKER_02]: team of a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe they just want to go to one of
these lounge experiences that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: describing where they can meet people with
shared experiences and learn how cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: can help their endocannabinoid system,
which in turn helps everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some simple first steps that they
can take now to help open those doors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up some veteran support groups and
just be present.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people ask, how can they get into
the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do again?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really just show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 seconds on Google may be all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For veterans that want to get into the
cannabis industry, there is no barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely no governing body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nobody necessarily really in
charge of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every state governs themselves very
uniquely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be opportunities that are
available to you in some states more than
[SPEAKER_00]: other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a state, I primarily
think of the South and the Midwest as just
[SPEAKER_00]: being so very far behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the coastal states really got it
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle, we need all this
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting those veterans to come out and
say, I'm a United States Air Force
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it for my medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also need it in a recreational
market because it's a multimillion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that I want to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that we haven't really
touched on is the fact that veterans need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get together and be very vocal because
we need to get cannabis to not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one substance anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we need to take
on federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the federal government is
a lot more apt to hear the voices of
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans talk about why they need it for
medicinal uses or to propel themselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: their businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our voices, I really believe,
are what's going to help to create that
[SPEAKER_00]: much needed paradigm shift so that way
cannabis can be there for everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it, especially those veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not get cannabis prescribed to us by
the VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get pharmaceuticals prescribed to the
VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing 22 veterans a day to being
overprescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we lost as many people in Congress as
we do veterans, they'd be gone in 25 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing veterans at a staggering,
alarming, unacceptable number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting them involved and getting them
away from those pharmaceuticals and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting them know about alternative health
is going to help to save their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is that important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you both for sharing your
experiences with us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both Ellen and Amber will be available
afterwards to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much to Ellen Brown and
Amber Sension.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
