[SPEAKER_00]: There are two aspects of teaching cannabis
medicine that stand out as most
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that cannabis educators
and caregivers must do a lot of personal
[SPEAKER_00]: work to be good at the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A caregiver cannot be overreacting to the
challenges the patient is going through
[SPEAKER_00]: while also not making light of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good caregiver is a difficult blend of
stoic, educator, and friend of last resort
[SPEAKER_00]: to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several times in the last decade I have
sat down with a terminally ill person who
[SPEAKER_00]: has asked me how to use cannabis in their
last days so they can be lucid saying
[SPEAKER_00]: goodbye to their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is heavy duty humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very serious conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That patient doesn't want my tears or
concerns for them most often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want me to stick to business and give
them the information they require,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them good product recommendation,
and be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a role of service and to do it right
it takes a lot of self and situational
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness by the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second especially challenging aspect
is that cannabinopathic medicine keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the paucity of cannabis knowledge we've
had is replaced by modern studies with
[SPEAKER_00]: more participants and better analytics,
we have to constantly update ourselves on
[SPEAKER_00]: the latest understanding because that
understanding is constantly evolving these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a doctor or caregiver who found
part one of endocannabinoid mechanics and
[SPEAKER_00]: has now returned for part two,
thanks for your dedication to the
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver service role.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humans under your care will be all the
better for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are here for yourself as a
cannabis patient like me, know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: material is presented to you so we can all
learn and grow and heal together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about cannabis
health, business, and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and with good cheer,

your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today my guest is Miyabi Shields,
PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Shields is co-founder of Real
Isolates, which ironically focuses on the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of secondary plant components
and synergistic plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi received their PhD in
pharmaceutical sciences focusing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry of the endocannabinoid system
from Northeastern University in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi has authored or co-authored six
peer-reviewed publications and presently
[SPEAKER_00]: has a patent under review for a novel
fungus and plant extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi also has a substantial list of
honors and awards, including a 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: International Cannabinoid Research Society
pre-doctoral research award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their TikTok channel, at Miyabi PhD,
has 130,000 followers and is where I first
[SPEAKER_00]: met Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is part two of Endocannabinoid
Mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the first set, we'll talk about
how certain cannabinoids function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second set is all about comparing the
various ways we get cannabinoids into our
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third set is about dosing
thresholds for cannabis efficacy for
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic and other serious patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to Shaping Fire, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had really enjoyed our first
conversation and it got a really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, people dug the quality and kind of
information that you should share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and do some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say offhand that taking THCA is a
lot like taking CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense to me in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, what does that really mean at a
chemistry level?
[SPEAKER_00]: That statement is too vague to really be
useful to most caregivers and patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just that THCA heals without the
euphoria of THC like CBD does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it work on similar receptors or
perhaps still something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you pretty much answered the
question yourself there with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, this is so weird without my
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so THCA is the acid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the acid version of THC, which means
that it has a extra carboxylic acid group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And carboxylic acid is a carbon that's
bonded to two oxygens and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively charged and it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that changes the shape of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that change in shape affects like a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing it affects is the ability
for the molecule to get into the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, the more charged
something is, like this, in this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: having a negative charge will decrease its
brain penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one way in which they're
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next way is how it binds to the actual
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been evidence that THCA does
bind to like the CB1 and CB2 receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's far less than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really interesting about people saying
qualitatively that it's similar to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, what's interesting about that is
that both THCA and CBD activate or turn on
[SPEAKER_01]: the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually the receptor that's
been linked to the beneficial mental
[SPEAKER_01]: health effects of CBD in mouse model
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're right on the money there
when you say that THCA and CBD interact
[SPEAKER_01]: similarly to serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people think that they feel
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually makes a lot of sense in
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that the THCA molecule hits the
same receptors though more lightly than
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD because a lot of folks who,
well, at this point, most people have got
[SPEAKER_00]: access to CBD one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of years ago, pre-CBD being
everywhere, people who only had access to
[SPEAKER_00]: THC through the heritage market would just
be able to go and enjoy undecarbed flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would give them the same kind of
anti-anxiety and anti-depression benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: similar-ish to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people use it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that's interesting about
THCA is it seems to be kind of universally
[SPEAKER_00]: give people serious munchies, you know,
so it's very, very useful for folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: have lost appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this, let's go one step deeper
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about these other novel
cannabinoids, the acid forms and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the varin forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As more novel minor cannabinoids are
studied and bred for, we're all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the opportunity to learn and smoke the
acid forms, the unheated, unaged forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: these cannabinoids, and also their varin
forms of THC and CBD and the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: To most folks, THC is the queen,
of course, and CBD is seriously helpful,
[SPEAKER_00]: but few folks understand the nature of the
acid and varin forms other than knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that THCV tends to inhibit appetite and
stops the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of hand this to you
in a basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you explain what the acid forms of
cannabinoids are in relation to their
[SPEAKER_00]: non-acid versions and then either during
or after do that same thing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: varins?
[SPEAKER_00]: So however you think it's going to be
explained more carefully, the gist of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question is give us a better understanding
what the acid and varin forms of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so I mean the acid forms are,
it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just add a carboxylic acid to the same
position it's on the phenol or benzene
[SPEAKER_01]: ring portion of the molecule and it is,
like I said earlier, it changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and the shape and also the
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called electronegativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a negative charge on the acid
versions of these and so they display very
[SPEAKER_01]: unique pharmacological profiles,
meaning that if you change the structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will change the receptors that it
interacts with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also changes, like I mentioned earlier,
about brain permeability or the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: for these molecules to get into the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it changes the distribution of where
these molecules end up interacting in your
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some pretty interesting
research done, I believe it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, on the acid versions of both
THC, CBD, CBG, so THCA, CBDA, CBGA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think CBDVA also to mix up both the
acid and the varin.
[SPEAKER_01]: form there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of really interesting
research that's being done on like
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-epileptic properties specifically
being linked to these forms and epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: shares a pathophysiology with a lot of
other disorders that people use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for, like migraines, cluster headaches,
and so I think it's going to be really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting to see more research
come out and also to see more qualitative
[SPEAKER_01]: information come out as people are able to
experiment and see what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic applications of it because I
definitely believe that there are unique
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic applications for these rare
variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting that we're at this
time where patients are able to literally
[SPEAKER_00]: do citizen science because prohibition for
so long has stunted scientific research
[SPEAKER_00]: and people who are desperate for relief
take cannabinoids just to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, all right, they're safe enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just see what happens to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we patients stumble upon things and
then we tell people and we tell other,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tell people, next thing you know,
there's something coming up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground that the more formal
scientific community needs to jump on and
[SPEAKER_00]: get evidence to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you describe the differences between
the acid forms and the regular forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so different, how they access the
brain or don't access the brain is
[SPEAKER_00]: different, the receptors that they attach
to are different and it sounds like in
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives me the idea that we
should not consider the acid forms to even
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be related in quality to their
non acid forms, like CBD-A doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily act or do what CBD does.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-A does not really act or necessarily
do what THC does and it sounds like their
[SPEAKER_00]: names, you know, cannabigerol,
for example, that has more to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the molecule chemically and
the addition or removal of this acid
[SPEAKER_00]: component really makes it an entirely
different cannabinoid than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more common non acid namesake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, structurally they're very
similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the only difference is one carbon,
two oxygens and then depending on the pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a hydrogen there or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in structure, they're super
similar and that's why they set,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, THC and THC-A, CBG and CBGA,
you know, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are very similar, but in terms of
like small, yeah, small changes in a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule will have really, really large
changes in therapeutic effects profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of like considering them
different things, like I would just like
[SPEAKER_01]: say as an example, you know, in the
pharmaceutical world, as an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are different benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very similar classes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're all slightly different
structurally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that's kind of like
the same here where like we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, but all the rare
cannabinoids are similar, but they do have
[SPEAKER_01]: slight differences in structure that can
have really large overall effects on like
[SPEAKER_01]: the therapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about the
varins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the varins are of course, you know,
so hot right now because for most of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all started with THC and then CBD came
out and kind of like rocked the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as people realized, oh my gosh,
if CBD, you know, is such a big deal,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other novel cannabinoids,
we're all hungry for those now and to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're diving, you know,
very, you know, diving deep into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the varins seem to be
the ones that are going to be hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene next as these seeds become available
this coming summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really all I really know about the
varins is that they are, there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been very few of them because
they've been bred out of cannabis more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less as people focused on breeding for THC
and I am told that THCV is an appetite
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressant, though I haven't really had
that experience myself because I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had a varin dominant, THC varin dominant
plant yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all of that said, what are you
unique to the varins?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as they start coming on the market in
the next year, people have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: frame of mind of what the hell people are
even talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference between the varins and
the parent molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we're talking about the parent
molecule being THC or CBD for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those molecules have like, if anyone who's
seen my videos, I call them a fatty tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a fatty tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those molecules have on the end of it,
a five carbon, it's called a pentel chain
[SPEAKER_01]: because pentel for five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a five carbon chain at the end of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a really, it's a fatty,
tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a piece of the molecule that is
very sticky, sticky like butter,
[SPEAKER_01]: greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has a very unique like chemical
property that interacts with receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The varins only have three carbons instead
of five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are shorter and there's a smaller
fatty tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that changes the way that it interacts
with receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I think is really
interesting about THCV specifically is its
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction with a receptor called TRPV1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you are familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stands for transient receptor
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanilloid one, it's not a very sexy name
for a receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a receptor that's an ion channel
that also interacts with the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been shown to be important for
like pain management, anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if it somehow is related
to its interaction with TRPV1 that it
[SPEAKER_01]: causes this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't seen too much research on
THCV yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to see more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of the reason why it's
difficult to study THCV is because it
[SPEAKER_01]: falls underneath the class of molecules
that are regulated since it's an analog of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is at least why I think there's less
on THCV than say CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really excited to learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually tried years ago, I tried like
a, I think it was a one-to-one-to-one
[SPEAKER_01]: microdoser, I think it was called a
tablingual was what it was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was CBD, CBG, and THCV,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's a number of variables
there that I'm changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a very interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just the therapeutic profile
of it was completely different from THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at the molecular level
for the varins, while we don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of research on them yet for a host of
reasons, do you as a chemist have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, educated guesses on what you
think the varins will do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are these cannabinoids so different
from each other where you're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: only God knows what's gonna the varins are
gonna do after we test them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't,
I guess I don't know necessarily like off
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of my head what I would predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think it's interesting that,
so the shortening, like the shortening of
[SPEAKER_01]: that fatty tail basically makes it
structurally more similar to less fatty
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules of which there are many in the
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely think like, without saying
anything like for sure, that I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it has unique, like it has a
unique profile, it probably has unique
[SPEAKER_01]: transport around the body as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I would be really excited to
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I also think it's, you know,
this is just something that is difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about when we're talking about
receptor pharmacology, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how molecules interact with
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at these things and we test
them, we're testing one thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're often looking at something for a
very specific reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many of the rare cannabinoids
have not been tested against some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: more classic system targets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dopamine or opioid or serotonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have, and there's definitely
some information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually when we discover a rare
cannabinoid or where we find something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's structurally related to the
cannabinoids, obviously the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you think is to test them on the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just, you know, anyways,
just research tends to get categorized if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, if I phrased this
correctly, like based on the grant funding
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of research and how research is
funded, you end up like having categories
[SPEAKER_01]: of research where labs will hyper
specialize in something because you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you have to do to get the
funding, to do your research and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, I mean, I think as we
expand beyond that and start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: crosstalk between systems and interactions
like on larger scales, which is starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen already, we're going to find
some really interesting interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: between all of these alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a whole nother level when
we start talking about putting them
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the crosstalk between the systems is
something that is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I have to give you credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one who taught me or turned me
on to start thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that is potentially an entirely
additional show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't get me started on the
crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: of endocannabinoid system with other
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's hold that aside and we'll
approach that another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the feeling that
cannabinoids give us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a lot in part one about the
mechanics and how the receptors work and
[SPEAKER_00]: how, you know, the cannabinoids can block
each other from the receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked a lot about that mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that, you know,
that sigh of relief that folks get from a
[SPEAKER_00]: cocktail at the end of a workday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when the alcohol hits the
bloodstream, you can feel your body shift
[SPEAKER_00]: down a few gears and you go like,
and then like everything feels a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also happens similarly, but kind of
different with cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, for those of us who prefer
cannabis, we'll have a bit and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits our bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes on and we have like that
similar sigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of like, you know,
depending on the kind of cannabis it is
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're floating or in the zone,
but whatever it is, we can feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: downshift from the intensity of production
mode, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's like being at work or,
or, you know, watching the kids or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever we happen to be doing,
it shifts us down into some sort of ease
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if it helps to say what's
happening with, with alcohol and then
[SPEAKER_00]: compare that to, to cannabis, I'm all for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but there, there's something very
specific mechanically that happens in that
[SPEAKER_00]: moment when, when the first of the
cannabinoids hit the, hit the bloodstream
[SPEAKER_00]: after work and we shift down into not
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I think we're all curious what,
what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to answer this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get really abstracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer this question with
something, an answer that is pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: something that can't be proven,
but that is also absolutely true,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that everything in the brain is
subjective to contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, what we're describing
here is the shift in your perception,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this contrast and that, and how that
initial shift, like the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first hit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus like the second, third,
fourth, or like, what you were describing
[SPEAKER_01]: the first drink at the end of the day,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as that, that initial change,
that very first alteration and your
[SPEAKER_01]: perception will always feel different than
the continuation of an altered state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's just because everything
that we interpret in our brains is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is relative to what has happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, that's also just true,
like in life and everything in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every single thing that our brain has
is built upon a contrast of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's already experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and our brains are very used to,
um, what is the way I want to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brains are very used to getting into
like a status quo, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping everything the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you cause like a dramatic
shift in that, that initial shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, you know, when you're on a hot,
it's like, it's a hot day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's been really hot here recently
and you're in the air conditioning and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you take your first step outside and
you're like, Whoa, it is hot and humid out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it's almost like when you step
outside for the first time or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or vice versa in the winter, you're in the
heat and you go out and it's cold and you
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like can't breathe for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're like, wow, that change in
temperature was dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was a dramatic change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you're, you're out there for
less than 30 seconds or a minute and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's something more similar to that
except in your processing of your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that status, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because absolutely like the
cannabinoids have anxiolytic effects,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, in, in general, they can,
they're relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's true all the time,
but in that initial, that first initial
[SPEAKER_01]: phase of changing your, like altering your
pharmacology in your brain, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that initial change will feel different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that has to do with the
fact that it's in contrast to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: were like before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that, that plays out with
how we experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a human too, because on, on our harder
days, that sigh of relief seems to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: intense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've had a light, yeah, if you,
if you have a light day and you come home
[SPEAKER_00]: and you puff, you're like, ah,
today was a pretty good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my, my, my cannabis is pretty good
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a good evening,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, like a uniform,
but if you've had, you know, a really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging day that has pushed and pulled
you emotionally and you get to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day and it hits your bloodstream,
you're like, oh my God, my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God, you know, and, um, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contrast aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also mentioned the anti-anxiety,
um, aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, would you hit that on a molecular
level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what is actually happening to
kick off that, uh, did you call it an
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiolytic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anxiolytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a kind of a, honestly,
this is kind of a complicated one to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain because the CB1 receptor,
so THC activates the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That receptor has been associated with
decreasing anxiety or having an anxiolytic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect at like lower concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also possible that it causes anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this whole, like, very delicate
balance going on, um, with, with why this
[SPEAKER_01]: happens, but in, in general, um,
at least at low concentrations,
[SPEAKER_01]: activating the CB1 receptor is responsible
for reducing some types of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not really, I'm trying to think
of like, in terms of like research that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most of the, most of the research has
been an animal models, although some of it
[SPEAKER_01]: has been like repeated in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like, um, it's called a
biphasic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like at a high concentration,
there's a second threshold that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: reach where all of a sudden it reverses
and it causes anxiety or it causes
[SPEAKER_01]: paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one thing I've been really
passionate about educating people about is
[SPEAKER_01]: that our, our thresholds are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of us will have a different,
you know, threshold for that second level
[SPEAKER_01]: of that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some people, they might never get
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and others, it might be a side effect
that it's, you know, it's very easy for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to, to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be in that second category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, it's made me very
aware of, you know, in, in the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: people talk about puffing tough,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, like, you know,
uh, have, have more, finish the joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: have another hit, you know, we,
we won't part of cannabis is definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's pressure to always use
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and I find that I think that that
is really stems from a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding by most folks that of this
biphasic effect where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a bit, you have the decrease
of anxiety and the increase of euphoria
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and your joy increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where that, that tapers off and,
and becomes anxiety causing is different
[SPEAKER_00]: for every person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, for myself, I know that,
you know, I can smoke a certain amount and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll put me right where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go beyond that, I can feel,
I actually don't know what I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel, I mean, I think about it as,
um, my, my, uh, adrenaline turns on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's how I explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, your flight, your fight or
flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not that far off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I'll, I'll have that a little bit
more and I'll just like, feel it turn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like you would feel an air
conditioner in your HVAC come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, air conditioner came or,
or, Oh, first time the heater came on for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can feel the house rumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will smoke a bit and I'll have a great
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll, and then I'll smoke a bunch
and I'll feel the adrenaline kick on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've, I've been smoking for
so long now that I'm like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to go outside for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to step out outside of the party time
to, you know, like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do a little bit of self care and check
in on my set and setting so that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we do have to be aware that we
all have got a different threshold for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people may never hit the anxiety
causing part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are other people like me
who it, my body tends to kick it in pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know that I need to check
myself earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run into this actually at conventions a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where people are outside and everybody's
puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying each other's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants me to try their stuff
because they're proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to celebrate how great their,
their grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I'm like,
if I do that a few times in a row,
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly I'm so anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go back into the convention,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we, will you, you know,
will you speak to that aspect of it about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like what happens mechanically,
if you will, when we, when we hit our
[SPEAKER_00]: biphasic threshold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm also, I am right there with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a total lightweight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically when it comes to anxiety and
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm at the point now where
like, I actually don't usually smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: anything from anyone else because I mix
things very specifically for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people are welcome to smoke with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would love to smoke, I'd love to
smoke you out at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we got to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been one of my passions to
understand this biphasic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to do with what's called
endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we discussed this a little bit
on the previous, the previous talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about Dr. Russo's
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it, in general, endocannabinoid tone
describes the levels of circulating
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the levels of the receptors,
the CB1, CB2 receptors, probably also
[SPEAKER_01]: TRPV1 and some of the GPRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are all different for each of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also a way of, it's one way of
describing neurodiversity, for those of
[SPEAKER_01]: you who are familiar with neurodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neurodiversity describes just differences
in the way that our brains can all process
[SPEAKER_01]: and have information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are all like, we are all very
similar in the way that our brains process
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are all very, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those ways has to do with
endocannabinoid signaling and the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of being really, really
sensitive, it means that for both you and
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when it comes to like anxiety or
paranoia, there is probably that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: an increased level of CB1 receptors in a
very specific part of our brain that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do not have a high threshold of
that have lower levels of CB1 receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: and are not as sensitive to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also why to a certain extent,
if you develop levels of tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes certain side effects will go
away because tolerance is usually,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's associated with a decrease in the
number of CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people when they develop tolerance
will realize that like certain effects go
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, generally when you develop
tolerance, you know, all of the effects go
[SPEAKER_01]: away without using more, but it's usually
like certain effects one at a time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of them go away first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to do with changing the
levels of CB1 receptors in very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we move on, I think I want to
just make a very intentional plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we made the case very obvious for
folks, but if you are a listener and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, a low biphasic threshold
for anxiety, so you puff a little and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get your anxiety decreased and then you
puff more and your anxiety increases,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend, do not let people bully you in
taking more THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are one of these people who
have got a very high threshold for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let's say that you're, you know,
you're dabbing and you can puff with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and you can puff all night,
please do not bully those of us who have
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lower biphasic threshold into
smoking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure offer it to us, but please don't
bully people into it because it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: different for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you care for that person enough
that you want to get them high,
[SPEAKER_00]: also be, you know, have enough care for
them to let them tell you that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they've had enough because we
don't want to, you know, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make your friend anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so anyway, I'll get off my soapbox on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely agree with that because all
of us are trying to just have a good time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone, we're all trying to
increase quality of life essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to be,
that's going to be different for all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also as another PSA, I would love for
people to start regularly saying like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh yeah, my biphasic threshold for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to make that a regular thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually THC is biphasic for a number
of effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's true that each of us has very
specific side effects that we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, prone to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also prone to getting very cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you prone to that, Chango?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually get cold from allergy
medications, my extremities specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get like cold fingers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, histamine receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hit one more question on this
tolerance and cannabinoids thing before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we talked about like the
having that end of day toke and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: shifts us down and decreases our anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, anybody who's toked and who
really appreciates that aspect has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably also come home and have a toke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you toke and you're like, you know,
something's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, depending on the person,
they might blame the flower or they might
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, oh, it's my tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as somebody who stuzzies
this in the lab, what are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the most common?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you think it's more often than
not like a tolerance response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are there also just some days that
we're not going to get high because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical blend in our brain that day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think that there's a number of,
I mean, tolerance definitely may play a
[SPEAKER_01]: part in it, but I've always, I mean,
set and setting, which is usually talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about in psychedelics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that's a more common, it's a more
common thing that people talk about in
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like the endocannabinoid
system and serotonin system share an
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely strong synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider cannabis a soft psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly near psychedelic
experiences or I would even, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: classify them as psychedelic experiences
that I've had on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that set and setting are really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we don't often,
you know, we don't often think about,
[SPEAKER_01]: so set being like the mindset that you're
going into and then setting being the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes your environment can be like
your, like the stress levels of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you're planning, what you are
planning or anticipating on doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things play a role in your
neurochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely feel like alterations in
your neurochemistry will affect the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, molecules feel when you
take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not always going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that like what we're looking
for is for something to always be exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with, I mean, everyone,
if we're going to make the same metaphor
[SPEAKER_01]: with alcohol, it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes it's a generally
speaking, you have a effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you have a really great
night and then other times like you're sad
[SPEAKER_01]: and you cry or you're angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't made that connection before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your brain, so the way that our
brains sort of like function and perceive
[SPEAKER_01]: the world is always in response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brain is always changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we are always in flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always going, our brains always
responding to something and it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like right now, you and I having this
conversation, our brain is in a transition
[SPEAKER_01]: from what it was two minutes ago to what
it's going to be two minutes from now,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was yesterday to what it's going
to be tomorrow, what it was last month to
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's going to be next month,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are changes that are going on on
every scale of time in the brain all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that will be different depending on
a number of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you brought up having stress,
having a really bad day, feeling really
[SPEAKER_01]: negative, that will alter your
neurochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown and proven that when
you're happy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you actually see more, your vision is
clearer and you notice more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get too deep into positive
psychology because that's like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nother, that's a whole nother rabbit hole
that along with crosstalk that we could go
[SPEAKER_01]: on to for forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a very big believer in positive
psychology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are subconscious things
that we can not change and that we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: alter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also believe that there are
conscious things that we can change in our
[SPEAKER_01]: minds and that we can really focus on and
behaviorally modify in ourselves that has
[SPEAKER_01]: an impact on our neurochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not these things can be
measured at this exact moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know for a fact that set and setting
and the way that we approach an experience
[SPEAKER_01]: really changes the outcome of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's part of why cannabis has
such a high placebo effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the expectation and what we are wanting
to receive from the experience having a
[SPEAKER_01]: big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea that some positive soft
talk, some thoughts in your brain or some
[SPEAKER_00]: mumbling to yourself about self-care and
self-love and being worthy could actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make our high better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a beautiful thing and I
think that we should make that the custom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I absolutely feel like that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why meditation goes so hand in
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and other psychedelics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go ahead and take our short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabinoid pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_00]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations,
including a nutrient enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's P-I-T-T-M-O-S-S.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing healthier, more sustainable
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I love growing under the sun,
there's a lot of good reasons to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like most folks,
you want a lighting source that grows high
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding, healthy plants without using
excessive amounts of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting creates biological lighting
solutions that brings the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliance of the outdoors into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lighting has the attributes that I
look for in a horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought those cheap lights online and
they're difficult to work with and fail
[SPEAKER_00]: and no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, my BIOS LED light is
industrial grade to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is IP 66 wet rated, so little foliar
overspray won't harm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to clean without taking it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the most important aspect
is built for the exact light spectrum I
[SPEAKER_00]: want for great yielding, healthy cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't hurt that their lighting
rigs look bad ass too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many horticultural LED lighting systems
are based on irrelevant performance
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics and people love to argue online
about these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to judge on par photon efficiency
and how happy my plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the BIOS lights exceed my expectations
in these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS lights have an optimized broad
spectrum that maximizes photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth while also providing the
ideal conditions for superior par efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: and a comfortable visual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love their attentive and
overeducated customer service folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: BIOS starts with a team of biologists
before getting the electrical engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have studied how light impacts
cannabis plants and devised an overall
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to check out their website
at bioslighting.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: how this strategy can work for you.

been family owned and providing reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_00]: sifts and back crosses to emphasize the

[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabinoid pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Miyabi, we've talked about these
different methods of bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids into our body, but anybody
who has spent a lot of time with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and has, you know, smoked and had edibles
and maybe tried a sublingual, they know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they all hit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say hit different, I mean that
they come on at a different rate and they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel different in the body and often they
will have different medicinal effects
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how we ingest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, would you please explain the
differences in how our body absorbs the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, that method of action,
and then the differences, chemically,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we as patients can use the best mode
for our desired relief?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to hit the first two,
the two largest and most significant
[SPEAKER_01]: routes of administration, which is
edibles, which is an oral administration
[SPEAKER_01]: or smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, with edibles, there's, well,
there's three differences in the two
[SPEAKER_01]: routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is like the actual
absorption, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that means when and where do the
molecules enter your body?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are those molecules entering your
body?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke, all of the cannabinoids
are absorbed in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get from the lungs into the blood and
go to the brain directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it happens in like less than a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just for every, also a PSA,
like don't hold in your hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it happens really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to like, don't hold your
breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're going to hit that,
and let's also reference from the Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Litman episode all on cannabis and
breathing, that not only is it not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to get your cannabinoids out,
as Miyabi is saying, but the longer you
[SPEAKER_00]: hit your hit, the more damage you are
causing your lungs and your cilia from
[SPEAKER_00]: having the hot heat in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like smoke particulates and other
things that will come over the longer
[SPEAKER_01]: you're holding your breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, definitely, yeah, no holding your
breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, it happens really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all of the cannabinoids get absorbed,
like let's say within one second of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them go to the brain and then have
their effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why usually it's like 10 minutes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a 10 minute onset between the
blood going from your lungs, your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: pumps it up to your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: With edibles, you eat them, they go
through your stomach, and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbed in the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have to pass through the
liver first, before then your body pumps
[SPEAKER_01]: them all the way through and then it gets
to your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in terms of absorption, it takes a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it could take anywhere between 30
minutes to sometimes three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people say that an edible has
hit them four to six hours later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also depends a lot on what you've eaten
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does your diet look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any GI issues or GI motility
issues that you struggle with,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, these things can all alter the length
of time and that has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing, is absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second difference is metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the smoking example, when you're
smoking it in the lungs, it goes straight
[SPEAKER_01]: to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no metabolism between that stage,
between it going from your lungs to your
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no metabolism, so it's THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of getting metabolized or
deactivated, it also happens all at once,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of why smoking has a very
short duration of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because as the smoke is after it
goes to your brain, then it goes to your
[SPEAKER_01]: liver and it all gets metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to edibles, they get
metabolized first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you eat an edible, gets absorbed
in the small intestine, goes through the
[SPEAKER_01]: liver and gets metabolized, most of us
make 11-hydroxy as the primary metabolite,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is more potent and has stronger
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there's another metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a carboxy version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that a significant portion of
people who cannot feel edibles create that
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love for someone to study that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a significant portion of
the population that can't feel edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a whole other topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those of us who can feel edibles,
your body metabolizes THC into 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually the molecule that will go
into your brain and cause effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is part of the reason why edibles
feel different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like I said earlier about the
absorption happening more slowly over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, that means that 11-hydroxy is
present more slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lasts much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another reason why the duration of
action is longer before it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: deactivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third difference,
which people don't usually talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: is transformation at high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cannabinoids are pretty sensitive
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you heat them to temperatures
that are above, say, like 300 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, you're causing a significant
change in molecular structure for a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant portion of the cannabinoids
that are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I think at 300 degrees
Fahrenheit, a study is done on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 30% of the THC converts into
CBN, or cannabinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dehydration reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, two hydrogens are removed
from, is it two?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two extra double bonds in the top
ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changes the actual formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this is my main research
focus, so maybe stop me, because I'll go
[SPEAKER_01]: on forever and ever about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, if you're smoking and
you're using a lighter, a lighter can
[SPEAKER_01]: reach temperatures well above 1,000
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're smoking a J, or like SPLIF
or something, you have an ember.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different chemistry,
because the actual area of the ember is a
[SPEAKER_01]: different temperature than the area right
above it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joints are very complicated, which I also
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get this very high temperature
transformation, and a significant amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabinoids are transformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a different formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the third difference,
because most edibles are made to preserve
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, or more recently, also now,
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is part of the reason why smoking
feels so different, is because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a completely different
formulation of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that idea that the lighter can
change the cannabinoids, that in and of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is like a huge thing that I put
into my notes that we should talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: later, because we could do the rest of the
show on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's hold that aside for a moment and
focus on, first, the two different forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC or cannabinoids that can come out
of the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that's a whole new path,
but let's hit that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are patients that talk to me
regularly who are concerned slash annoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: that they eat edibles and nothing happens
to them, or they can eat 100-milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-rich edible and get a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both frustrated because it's
much more expensive for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are a patient who needs
edibles, then they're in a very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said that when the cannabinoid
goes through the liver, it'll break into
[SPEAKER_00]: 11-hydroxy, or a second one that I
actually missed the name of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you suggesting that each human has
got their own ratio of THC into the liver
[SPEAKER_00]: and then coming out is this different
percentage between the 11-hydroxy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's less 11-hydroxy, you may have
to eat a whole lot more edible in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the results and the relief that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is actually a problem that I
brought up to other scientists a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: At an international conference for
cannabis science and no one had heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: this phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be aware of this phenomenon if
it wasn't for TikTok, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never heard of it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are three possible,
there are some possibilities for why this
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of these have been proven yet,
but they are just all theory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is a problem with
absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some sort of problem where the THC
doesn't really get absorbed at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think this is a likely problem
because of how THC, it's such a
[SPEAKER_01]: fat-soluble molecule, it comes over
membranes really, really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that's the possibility
for most people, but it's an option,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might have an altered
microbiome, for example, or differences in
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption and then they just are not
actually absorbing the THC in the small
[SPEAKER_01]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next two possibilities have to do with
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two phases of metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one was the one I was talking about
with hydroxy, the formation of 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase one is normally just oxidation,
so you add an oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other option was a carboxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to name the whole name
because it's just like numbers and not
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second version of it is a carboxy,
which is just a carboxylic acid instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: a hydroxyl group, which is just another,
it's basically one extra oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to what I was talking to you about
THCA, a carboxylic acid versus THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, though, our bodies add the
carboxylic acid to the 11 position,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is right at the top of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that carboxymetabolite is inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the determining factor of which one of
those molecules our body makes has to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with our metabolic enzymes in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our body is absorbing the THC,
goes to the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the liver, there are enzymes present,
and those enzymes determine what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: to that molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a mutation in the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a variation in the levels of
these different enzymes that are present,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's possible that for the people who
can't feel edibles, their body is not
[SPEAKER_01]: making 11-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only making this inactive version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're eating the edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THC goes in, and then your body turns
it into something inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that that metabolite
doesn't have any effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen a lot of research on it,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be doing something,
but it's not having the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating effects because it's not
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other option has to do with
phase two metabolism, which is the second
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: What our body does is it takes the
molecule and it adds a sugar acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called glucuronidation, and that
inactivates the molecule as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, it just takes a
sugar molecule, you snap the sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule on it, boom, the thing is turned
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another option, which is that
people might have a very, very fast phase
[SPEAKER_01]: two metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps someone that's taking an
edible, specifically for THC, they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel it because they take the edible,
their body does phase one metabolism,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it immediately does phase two and
then everything is inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see research on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there is the option that there's
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some option there that some people
who are really heavy cannabis users
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a tolerance and then you don't see
these marked effects with edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have seen people say they've
taken hundreds and hundreds of milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that just doesn't add up when you
take into the account that these people
[SPEAKER_01]: also probably smoke flour and can feel 100
milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they smoked it, they would get hit
upside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that doesn't match up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means to me that there's a problem with
absorption or metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually this is something I'm
collaborating with another pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist on to establish how prevalent it
is in the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her name is Riley.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's also a pharmaceutical scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Riley and I used TikTok actually to
poll how many people could feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a significant population of people
who can't feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's something worth looking
into to figure out at least why.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then let's thread the needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've talked about smoking on one
side being fast and heavy hitting and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we've hit on edibles, which are
significantly slower, but can be stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: and more, I don't know, time released,
longer acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about sublinguals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes in the mouth, but it also doesn't
go through the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through your mucosal membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that intake like chemically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about sublinguals,
are we talking about tinctures that you
[SPEAKER_01]: put under your tongue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tinctures or a sublingual spray or
normally it is cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has got a little bit of residual
ethanol in it so that when it hits your
[SPEAKER_00]: mucosal membranes or just like the tissue
in your mouth, the residual ethanol takes
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole plant medicine over through the
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't know if something is
wrong with my mouth, but I have never been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to feel sublinguals successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just talk about it in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, when you absorb something
either sublingual or sub buccal,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like a cheek, there are some
cheek swabby products that I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: before on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of those methods of action should
bypass first pass metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be really quick, similar to
smoking in the lungs and be, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: have comparable advantages as smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No transformation, obviously, because
there's no heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like personally, anecdotally,
I haven't had tons of success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also if we are talking about a
tincture and you put it under your tongue
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eventually you do swallow it,
that then becomes inedible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whatever is left that didn't get
absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the street wisdom on this anyway
is that there's a small amount of fluid in
[SPEAKER_00]: a tincture normally and you put it
underneath your tongue and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might hold it, you might not,
depending on what the tincture is made out
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may burn too much to hold it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever, you put it in your mouth,
you swish it around a little bit and you
[SPEAKER_00]: swallow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk to folks, anecdotally,
folks believe that the THC is absorbed in
[SPEAKER_00]: their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they swallow it, you know,
it's a long road from the mouth to the
[SPEAKER_00]: gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going through the throat and the
esophagus and all this kind of stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: their way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the rest of it is actually soaked
in on the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before it gets to the intestines and
therefore it never becomes inedible.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that hit for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine for people to think that though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any proof that that doesn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it becomes inedible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my personal opinion is whatever
doesn't get absorbed in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_01]: then when you swallow it, maybe there is
like trace absorption in like the
[SPEAKER_01]: esophagus or the stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in like in general, the small
intestine is what's built to absorb like
[SPEAKER_01]: exogenous, like in general, the small
intestine is where our body like absorbs
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like when you eat food,
it's like very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some sublingual absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you eat it, like very,
I would say like, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a GI person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think most of the absorption happens
to the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet another thing we've hit on today that
needs more study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what's wrong with my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't feel, I cannot feel sublinguals
ever pretty much with, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel them like an edible like way later.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to the ever popular
method of suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, even though suppositories
get a little bit of a giggle because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: popping something into our rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of patients that I have
worked with that, you know, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: discover this, they literally cry with
relief and joy because either they have
[SPEAKER_00]: got severe stomach problems and they have
a hard time eating anything or B,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a, you know, they've got an
issue in the liver where they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: making the 11 hydroxys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not feeling anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, they can't smoke
or they're cancer patients and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to take in absurd amounts of
cannabinoids all at once and taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: orally gets them super duper high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they introduce them, the
cannabinoids to their body as a
[SPEAKER_00]: suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is absolutely a need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, some people just say that
they like the high better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've definitely run into folks who
are using their cannabis recreationally as
[SPEAKER_00]: a suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's pretty darn rare,
but, you know, people are into all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as I understand it,
the suppository will break down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids are absorbed by the
tissue along the walls of the rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really don't understand what the
chemistry is beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that suppository is also
bypassed for past metabolism, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's interesting that you mentioned
that the high is different from
[SPEAKER_01]: suppositories because that indicates that
there is like a difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism or the absorb, like,
well, not the absorption, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also the location of absorption,
you know, so that there's no metabolism,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that it's not 11 hydroxy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets absorbed and then it goes to
the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's also faster because it
doesn't have to go all the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: your stomach to your small intestine and
through the liver and get metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's like in terms of
like stigmatization and talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: things that have to do with like our
private parts, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a really important method that I
think is very valuable for the reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've mentioned, like people who
have severe nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really, I've heard that it's
been, I'm assigned female at birth and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a menstrual cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have heard that suppositories are
really, really useful for people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: PMDD or who have other sorts of like
hormonal or like painful issues like
[SPEAKER_01]: endometriosis or cysts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually heard qualitatively from
quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm going to blank on her name,
but there is a research scientist who's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking into this specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in terms of like method
and options, I think I would just describe
[SPEAKER_01]: it as like a very, like a very,
very useful option, a very, very useful
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic method that has definitely
deserves its place amongst like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, you know, when I see them,
they sell out here like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I actually haven't been able to get
my hands on one ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell out like immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand is really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of people go through a
lot of effort online to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy ones with like shea butter and
coconut oil and they put them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, little, little formed ice trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put them in the freezer so they
harden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's always a little giggle
when you put it there because of it being
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know enough patients who do this,
you know, a couple of times a day where
[SPEAKER_00]: they just don't even bother making the
proper shea buttery coconut suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just take a cellulose capsule,
put the RSO in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then apply it because the fluid that
is in the rectum is plenty to break down a
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can be fancy and gentle
or you can just like get her done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and as we know,
really sick people, they usually just go
[SPEAKER_00]: for the get her done option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in terms of like not needing
to, yeah, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought about the do it yourself
method for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought there was some sort of
fancy contraption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, the pharmaceutical
industry, they can make everything more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that you said that
really stands out for me is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you said that since a
suppository would skip the level one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the liver and so the 11 hydroxy is not
being made, a suppository would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: only non-smoking option that actually
delivers THC to the brain unchanged.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, sublingual, too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's true, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in theory for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in theory for me, other people with
normal mouths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know also that there's been a lot of
research into transdermal applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to my knowledge, no one has been able
to crack the transdermal situation where
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually enters the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like so so far, to my knowledge,
like transdermal, which I love topicals
[SPEAKER_01]: also, like I think they definitely have
therapeutic validity, but they don't enter
[SPEAKER_01]: the bloodstream, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a very high local concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the at one point, I agreed with that
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I have come across enough people
who are using a topical that has got a an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol component and they they use a THC
rich topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they use enough of it,
they actually feel the the intoxication
[SPEAKER_00]: from the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have heard just anecdotally that
people will who don't smoke will will test
[SPEAKER_00]: positive on a urine analysis after only
using THC rich topical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you saying that you have
explanations for that or okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm really interested also in terms of
like the ethanol topical that makes people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk to you more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first about the drug testing,
a lot of the drug tests are not testing
[SPEAKER_01]: for THC, they're testing for the
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's actually possibly it's
possible with with any of the topicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: because your body will metabolize them and
the metabolites can stick around for like
[SPEAKER_01]: months, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the question of whether or not it
gets in the blood and up to the brain in
[SPEAKER_01]: like its active form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wait, the metabolites, your body will
produce metabolites, even if the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't reach the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like by I think what my thought process
was by the time the THC reaches the blood
[SPEAKER_01]: and like is being cleared out of the
topicals from topicals is that it already
[SPEAKER_01]: has been metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you don't get any activity
because it doesn't enter into the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just that's just my like
thought process behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually know I should look it up
actually later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interesting that you said that you've
had people who felt a psychoactive effect
[SPEAKER_01]: from topicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know did they apply it in a very
specific place on their body?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can give you two I can give you
two answers for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first answer is I normally find
people say they have felt it more when
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to cover a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is usually people who have got
back and hip or leg issues where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: covering their back, their shoulders,
their their, you know, their hip bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe their their tush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, you know, it's it's not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I've never come
across it with somebody who's using it for
[SPEAKER_00]: like like hands, elbow arthritis,
tennis elbow, stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been people who are taking
care of a large swath of the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, you know, I have been
making tinctures for myself for over a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade for my brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I had to start wearing
gloves when I made my tinctures,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if I had a spill and I cleaned it
up, the the alcohol with the suspended
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids in it would, I'm assuming,
soak through my hands and I would get like
[SPEAKER_00]: hella high and have to go lay down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, all right, guess who's
going to start using latex gloves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so that's my own personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so my belief is certain that that THC
can be carried through the skin with
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the topical people who I have,
you know, learned from have said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, the emu oil and all
these other things are all good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you really want to take
cannabinoids to the skin, there has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an ethanol component for efficiency and
expediency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a topicals expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not standing here saying that this
is all to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying this to inform the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go home today,
mix my topicals with ethanol and cover my
[SPEAKER_01]: back in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I am so interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the back, it's interesting
because, you know, the spinal cord is the
[SPEAKER_01]: central place where the peripheral and
central nervous system like interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, there's a lot going on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm fascinated by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, like many, many scientists would be
fascinated by that because there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of studies about penetration,
like skin penetration, like specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, that's that's awesome
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely going to, you know,
I'm going to home trial that home
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice that that we happen to be
working with a plant that we can home
[SPEAKER_00]: trial stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, anybody who listens to
shows knows I'm a huge fan of citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that often citizen
science can kick out bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a that's something we always
have to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, even though we have a
larger and increasingly larger scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: community around cannabis, we have a hell
of a bigger community of cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_00]: who are trying to do their own research at
home to relieve their suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much to be learned from
those folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it's exponential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the power is in the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge believer of personal experience
because like, when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one's going to know you as well as
you know yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no one is going to understand you
and the way that you feel the way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's weird, though,
not all scientists are into citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have spoken with cannabinoid
researchers who will all talk to at
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions and they will talk trash about
the patients doing their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can understand their frustration
because there's a lot of inaccurate
[SPEAKER_00]: science that's handed around by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I don't think that's
a reason to discount citizen science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that it needs to be checked,
just like I have to check regular,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, professional scientists to find
out who's paying for their studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, any kind of research needs to be
looked at, you know, with open eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that just means that we
should put more effort into public
[SPEAKER_01]: education so that people doing the citizen
science are more educated in scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: theory and like able to execute it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this like the idea that we
shouldn't be experimenting on ourselves is
[SPEAKER_01]: just naive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every single human in your entire
life, all you're doing is experimenting
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it's an N equals one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, when you find your person
and N equals two or for people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: polyamorous and N equals X like number of
people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I think that I agree that it can
be there can be negative like myths and
[SPEAKER_01]: like what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You called it bro science, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that there are problems that that
arise from that and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's unfortunate that people can believe
that that's true at face value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that there's been some
pretty important things that come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: qualitative experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically, that was like all we had
in the past, like previous four thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of the new cannabis
knowledge is just because of the machinery
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're using to look at it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which comes with with like a bunch of
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love my field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obsessed with molecular pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we would we would need a whole
nother show for me to just explain to you
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the assumptions that go into what I
did, which is in vitro pharmacology,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is actually like screening a drug
molecule against a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did structural biochemistry of
endocannabinoid system targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is just an exponential number of
assumptions that you make in research
[SPEAKER_01]: science that doesn't, you know,
they call it the transition from bench to
[SPEAKER_01]: bedside, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From from the laboratory bench to the
bedside of a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that like discounting human
experience is and like invalidating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's detrimental to the
cannabis industry as a whole, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have so much information out here and so
much power and people who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase their quality of lives and so
much information that gets lost because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just going to devalue it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm chuckling myself how
much fun it would be to do a show called
[SPEAKER_00]: Invalidating Cannabinoid Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just go into all the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to eat some mango and then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can be more high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and take that second break
and get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabinoid pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_00]: their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Night Owl Seeds works tirelessly,
bringing you auto flower genetics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable, thriving and with extraordinary
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl Seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their
[SPEAKER_00]: founder, Daz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Night Owl Seeds really are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos and buy fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proof is there and obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are complex and rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics like
I am, you'll likely also love Night Owl
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl founder, Daz, worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_00]: years, including breeding Mephisto's much
loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing both Night Owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Night Owl Seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs, and desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night Owl even has the Secret Owl Society
Text Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just text the word Night Owl, one word,
to 760-670-3130 for early announcements
[SPEAKER_00]: and exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about upcoming drops by following
[SPEAKER_00]: the Night Owl Seeds Instagram too at Daz
.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's D-A-Z.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your packs of Night Owl Seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and Hembra
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Night Owl Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow-up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_00]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, Shaping Fire has been
invited to sponsor several cannabis cups,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've said no to them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until the AutoFlower Cup that I
really wanted to help promote something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the producers, Sebastian and Carla,
didn't even invite me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approached them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them that AutoFlower Cup was
important to me for three reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it was obvious that they were going
for a friends and family vibe instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of commodified cannabis vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event was going to gather really cool
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, the event had a ton of cool stuff
to do and to learn and to participate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event isn't just about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about living life fully, enjoying
community, eating together, laughing and
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to music, and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, and most important to me
personally, the event was authentically
[SPEAKER_00]: for the AutoFlower community, and the
AutoFlower community needs a place too.
[SPEAKER_00]: AutoFlower is about getting high,
sure, but I find that much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: AutoFlower community is still focused on
cannabis patients, home grow, sharing best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, sharing seeds, and humility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ideals that I share with the
event, and I wanted to make sure I did my
[SPEAKER_00]: part to help it succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Announcing the 2021 AutoFlower Cup,
August 6th, 7th, and 8th in Lillawoop,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This over 21 event is presented by Camp
Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AutoFlower competition is open to
everyone, commercial and home growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: so get your skills recognized and enter
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cup win now will make you a leader in
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes the ear candy, Stunden Glass
Hookah Lounge, Pop-Up Magical Butter
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate Shop, Waterfront Marketplace
with an array of vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be an old school AutoFlower
seed swap, joint rolling competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cooking demos, solventless
squishing demos, and late night
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary screenings of Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chef Sebastian Carossi's award winning
classics like Elk Chili, Kobe Beef Kimchi
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs, Oyster Po Boys, and Razor Clam
Chowder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild oyster harvesting, mushroom foraging,
s'mores around the campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian Presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms presentations,
camping, glamping, RVs, and Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check out CampRuderalis.com for those
details and follow the Instagram at The
[SPEAKER_00]: AutoFlowerCup 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabinoid pharmacologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miyabi Shields, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Miyabi, we got to go back to the
mango, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We threw it in there at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we threw it in there at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, there are so many
people still talking about having mangoes
[SPEAKER_00]: before you get high because it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get it directly from a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that if you believe it will make
you higher, that it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I normally say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's placebo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it feeds into set and
setting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you believe it to be true, your brain
tends to, you know, tell you that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me, if I break it down to like what
people normally talk about, it's Mersene,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are normally talking about the
terpene that is present in mangoes that
[SPEAKER_01]: will then make you feel higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen about like the
bioavailability of Mersene and the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of Mersene that is present in mangoes,
which means that when you eat it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how much of it actually enters your
system, our body metabolizes terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really quickly, specifically if
you're going edible route of
[SPEAKER_01]: administration, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard for me, it's difficult for me
as a scientist to believe that eating a
[SPEAKER_01]: mango, which has relatively low amounts of
Mersene that are bioavailable that then
[SPEAKER_01]: get metabolized almost immediately would
like make it to the brain to have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm much more convinced of the fact
that if you were to believe that that were
[SPEAKER_01]: true and you had that in your head,
that that would absolutely happen for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't think there's anything
wrong with the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like while we're just on the topic of
placebo, like ultimately at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, what are we trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to have an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people ask me sometimes like about,
like I take CBD every day and it helps me
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have asked me about it being
like, how are you sure it's not a placebo?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually could not answer that for you
with a hundred percent certainty because
[SPEAKER_01]: no one can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it matters whether or
not it's a placebo because it works for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that like coming to like
mango and the science and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: from what I've seen, I don't believe like
scientifically that anything biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: is going on other than altering your
expectation of what it will feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in line what Dr. Ethan Russo
shared with us during the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions video too when we were talking
about eating food to support your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also agrees with you that it is it's
just expectation and there's nothing going
[SPEAKER_00]: on at a physiological level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that doesn't mean that any
of this mango mythology is going to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down one iota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in set three, I want to talk about
dosing thresholds for efficacy because in
[SPEAKER_00]: serious and chronic patients, this is
something they're constantly struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many patients fall into like the
overall bucket of immune disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
lupus, Hashimoto, Epstein-Barr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are so many of these people
when you put them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of them are using cannabis
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cannabis seems to help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: More cannabis helps some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But heroic doses are hard to determine and
may not give increasingly better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though somebody is really
sick, more cannabis may or may not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, though maybe it is because of
their tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question for you is, what is the
efficacy threshold point between these
[SPEAKER_00]: serious imbalances and knowing what is the
maximum they should take that makes sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't want patients wasting
money on too many cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference between 50 milligrams
of whole plant CBD and 200 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant CBD really can make a
difference in certain patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, I also have to just say like,
just little disclaimer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a medical professional or
doctorate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a research scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: My right, like all of my expertise is just
on like molecular pharmacology of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will speak to what I personally
believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: About efficacy and dosing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that I think in general,
what you're looking for for every person
[SPEAKER_01]: is what's called the therapeutic minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the amount of cannabinoids that
you need to take in so that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic effect, but not any more than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you start taking in more than
what would be the therapeutic minimum,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start getting negative effects
like tolerance or withdrawal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like off target effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of like, what is that
therapeutic minimum?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is where unfortunately,
it's again, with what we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about earlier between you and I,
it's dependent a lot by the person and
[SPEAKER_01]: what therapeutic indication they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's so complicated because
there is no one stop fill out like form
[SPEAKER_01]: for saying you are this tall, you weigh
this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this much is the amount that I
mean, you know that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that we've actually
been struggling with in terms of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding like, medical validity to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that's a that's a big
barrier, I think, in my mind is that some
[SPEAKER_01]: people can't wrap their brains around the
fact that we can't actually tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: dose is beneficial, like, largely,
that responsibility is going on to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer or the patient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, more and more, like what you were
talking about with citizen science,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're realizing that it's up to us to do
this experimentation to figure out what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people in the general public
feel like not capable of making that
[SPEAKER_01]: decision, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to explain something
that and this is it only works for people
[SPEAKER_01]: who can monitor their symptoms with a
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically called it's called a
titration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a titration means adding something
slowly until you reach like an
[SPEAKER_01]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the, I guess the layman's way
of explaining it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever you go to a doctor and I'm
talking mostly right now, mental health is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the easiest example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to a psychiatrist, they usually
start you on the lowest dose of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go back and you see them like
once a week for like a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they decide like, okay,
we have to increase it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you increase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see them once a week for a
couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, maybe you increase it,
maybe you stay the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they are doing is a titration,
which means that they're starting at the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest possible dose and then monitoring
the effects of that molecule as that on
[SPEAKER_01]: you specifically as a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in lieu of being able to do that with
cannabinoids, depending on your medical
[SPEAKER_01]: professional, which also if you have a
medical professional that you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest with, that would be the best case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take down the information and you
give them that information and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: give you what they think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in lieu of that, you could also do
that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep a journal or an Excel sheet or
any sort of, has to be written down
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you write everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You write down what you're using and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you give your symptoms that you're
trying to reduce a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: You quantify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's going to be subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that it's going to be biased,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're the one writing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more information than you would
have otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good way to look at something
with numbers sometimes and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you write everything down and
you see that's also the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide or determine whether or not you're
developing a tolerance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, for people who are just
getting to know themselves, for people
[SPEAKER_01]: like you and I who've been using cannabis
for years and years, you end up just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of with an inherent knowledge of yourself,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people who are just getting
started, I say start small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always great to start small and then
to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what you're looking at,
at improving, you could give it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of time because certain effects take
time to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different effects level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's acute effects of a molecule,
which is immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acute effects of THC would be the
high, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's more long-term effects,
like the down regulation of CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might take more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take a week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're writing everything down and
if you're being very intentional about
[SPEAKER_01]: your use, and I realize this sounds like
kind of a lot of work, but once you get in
[SPEAKER_01]: the habit of doing it, it really just kind
of becomes habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There also are apps out there that will
help you, like tracking apps and habit
[SPEAKER_01]: apps and things on the phone that I think
can be really, really useful in helping
[SPEAKER_01]: you to find out what is the dose that's
working and how is it working for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, unfortunately,
this type of self-evaluation is really
[SPEAKER_01]: useful for people who have symptoms that
are outward-facing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes much more complicated when you
talk about something like cancer and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't see your tumors or your METs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least in some of those cases,
we can look at analytics, but we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: more about cancer in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are saying is accurate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, you're calling for patients
to try trade-up, and then journal their
[SPEAKER_00]: results to get to know their cannabinoid
tone and their body and how that matches
[SPEAKER_00]: with their relief goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire is big fans of journaling and
titration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to discount this, but at the end,
that just means that the answer is trial
[SPEAKER_00]: and error, which is what these patients
are already doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, and it's the applied trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks that we don't have a better
answer for these folks because doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and error, that titration and
journaling, you're probably gonna hit over
[SPEAKER_00]: medication a couple times and have some
crappy, paranoid experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably gonna have to be patient
when you're feeling impatient because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're experiencing symptoms from
whatever's going on for you, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with those symptoms while you're
trying to figure out if you need 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50, or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 200 milligrams of CBD a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can take so much time, especially if
a patient has got, somebody who's got
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashimoto, Epstein-Barr, and RA,
plus migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a total mess of symptoms that you're
trying to work your way through,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we can do is suggest titration and
taking a journal and talking with other
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But golly, that's a disappointing,
that's the best I can offer folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's honestly one of the things that I
would be, that is most interesting to me
[SPEAKER_01]: is formulations and understanding how
specific formulations come into play with
[SPEAKER_01]: this because I think it's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that in terms of
titration, the other option is to go
[SPEAKER_01]: outside in, as I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option that's not, so titration
is slowly increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's increasing until you reach
equilibrium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The opposite of that would be outside in,
which is taking the smallest dose and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing what you feel, and taking the
largest dose you're comfortable with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing how you feel, and then working
your way in from that, if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wow, taking that biggest dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds sketch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that's not, that's why I
don't recommend it, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just putting it out there as the
alternative option of the, in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in some ways, in some forms of
engineering, that's a fast way of finding
[SPEAKER_01]: the optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe I would recommend that for all
the cannabinoids except for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that it's a good one for CBD
or CBG, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so then let's talk about,
for cancer, and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be a similar answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, taking tinctures for symptoms,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's say, you know, primarily,
probably THC, but certainly there are
[SPEAKER_00]: applications for CBG and CBD, but let's
just say generally 10 to 20 milligrams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day for THC spread out over the day is a
very common dosage for folks who are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer treatment, just to help with the
side effects, you know, so they can get
[SPEAKER_00]: back their appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel some muscle relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just feel better in this body that
they are inhabiting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, 10 to 20 a day, that's
pretty typical versus the large doses of
[SPEAKER_00]: full extract cannabis oil, also known as
RSO, for cancer patients who are going for
[SPEAKER_00]: a cure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are going to a cure,
that 10 to 20 milligrams a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on where they are in
the cycle, will be 300 to 750 milligrams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, which is like, like a whole hell of a
lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is that, you know,
the go-to protocol has been 60 milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis oil over 90 days, and that
usually takes a big thwack at the cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and either the person will decide to do
another round, or it's solved,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the patient doesn't want to do it
anymore, either because they're PSA
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers haven't gone down, for example,
or they just can't handle that much THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lifestyle choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all of that is to set up this
question, which is, you know, is it even
[SPEAKER_00]: known what the efficacy is against big
monsters like cancer for THC, or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: simply, you know, how it's been done in
the past of let's throw THC at it and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it sticks, and it just hasn't been
updated with appropriate science yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the cannabinoids show anti-tumor,
anti-tumorgenic properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's been established, but the way
that we test this in the lab has a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with, usually it's either a cell
culture or animal model, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have all the human information
out there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what you're describing, all the
people with the protocol and using really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really high doses of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, is there science behind it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I know, or can we say, like,
what dose, what threshold are the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-tumor properties going to have
effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is also why I think people lean
towards more, because in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, like, if you're going to err on the
side, if you want anti-tumor properties
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're trying to err on the side of
getting those, then in theory,
[SPEAKER_01]: more or a higher dose would be better than
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a patient tell me that she was going
to go big or go home, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's all like, if I'm not going to do
chemo, I'm going to take all the THC that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pack into my body, because that's
where all my chips are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is unrelated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not unrelated from the
endocannabinoid system, but it's unrelated
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one thing of interest whenever
cancer comes up that I mentioned is
[SPEAKER_01]: fasting and the effect of ketosis,
which ketosis is when your body runs out
[SPEAKER_01]: of sugar and begins burning ketones for
energy instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're burning fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system is a fat
signaling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's involved in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big shift that occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is related to endocannabinoid
system, not necessarily related to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but there's a lot of evidence
out there that fasting is very beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of its, like, anti-tumor
properties, like anti-metastatic
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just, it's beneficial in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, like, this isn't the topic that
we're on whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that I thought was
worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's kind of on topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, let me tie it in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many of the patients who are on
high THC dosage, full extract cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: for cancer, you know, it's very common
that they get sleepy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just nap all day long and their
caregiver needs to arouse them to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat and to go to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges with patients is
to make sure they keep their weight up
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're spending so much time
sleeping and they get over the munchies
[SPEAKER_00]: part of cannabis really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so generally, patients lose weight in
the last, you know, say four to five weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of using a full extract cannabis oil for
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wouldn't that be interesting if it is
the decreased calorie intake, which causes
[SPEAKER_00]: the boost to the immune system,
which is playing a big role in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that it's synergistic,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I also, like, we have to mention
that, like, obviously getting proper
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition and, like, not losing a
significant amount of weight.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to not lose weight,
but it tends to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, there's, I mean, in terms of,
like, so cancer is the overactive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not a cancer expert, like,
whatsoever also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, but just in general, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cancer is what happens when there's
a mutation in your cells and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: over, they overactively reproduce and
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they are evading the immune,
like normally, normally, if our immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system was to be functioning authentically
or correctly, then the immune system would
[SPEAKER_01]: identify those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have mutations in our cells all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of us, like probably
right now has at least one cell in our
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least one cell in our body
that's doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, our bodies aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a system in place that,
like, identifies those errors and fixes
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cancer occurs where somehow the cancer
cells are evading that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that, and the
endocannabinoid system is integrally
[SPEAKER_01]: linked to immune function and to energy,
you know, energy homeostasis or energy
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cancer cells take up a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're replicating very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's, there's all the anti-tumor
properties of the cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's all the endocannabinoid
system interaction with the immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's really complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could not imagine what I would feel
like if I was, if I was diagnosed with
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't, I can't speak for sure what I
would definitely do in that scenario,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that when that happens and
when you get that diagnosis, your life
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I could be saying something
now that I believe I would do and I maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is my belief currently that if I
were to be diagnosed with cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would use cannabis and fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would also be open to
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would be open to it,
but I think it would not be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back and I'm going to bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I heard you used a subtle change in
your intonation when you used the word
[SPEAKER_00]: normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in your next sentence,
all the places that you would have used
[SPEAKER_00]: normally, you swapped out that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you not choose to use the word
normally to describe a function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, yeah, that's funny,
Shango, that you picked up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that, I don't like the word
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I dislike that word almost in every
context or way that you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: in any way that you could use that word to
describe human functionality, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's just kind of where that
came from is that I even do, I slip up all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used the word normally and then I think
about it and I'm like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the most correct way to say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that normal and using the word normal
implies, it implies that we have an
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of human diversity and
functionality that we just don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my personal opinion that I don't
like using the word normal to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: anything having to do with humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it assumes that there is an
established standard that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you hit that on the head with that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slipped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe there's a normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I heard, you know how you can hear
someone's mind thinking as they build
[SPEAKER_00]: their sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard you play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, there's something going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's finish up this episode with a
follow up question from part one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: did a few weeks back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talked a lot about tolerance
breaks during part one of this
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid mechanics series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number one question I got from
folks was about taking a tolerance break
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabinoids that are not THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you said something really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about how often you do THC
tolerance breaks and how they're good for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also said that you don't take
tolerance breaks from CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what everybody was asking me
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, ask her why she doesn't take
them for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't she need to, you know,
doesn't Miyabi need to take a break from
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, CBD because they may be getting
a tolerance from CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the same questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how about THC a and how about CBG
then because patients are all taking these
[SPEAKER_00]: various non THC cannabinoids and they all
expect that they need to take a break from
[SPEAKER_00]: them just like they would THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by your comment that you don't take
one from CBD left everyone in a quandary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you flesh that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized that I actually misspoke
because I use full spectrum products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't actually technically take
breaks from THC either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even there's even trace amounts in
your CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's small amounts and then I use
how I smoke hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be small amounts of
Delta 8 in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, that's it's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's well under it's going to be
well under one percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't take breaks from the
cannabinoids, I guess, in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the main way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of like THC and like larger,
like relatively larger doses of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently am taking like a one to one
CBG CBD extract every morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like it has small amounts of THC
present and a bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whatever else is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting because like,
do I need to take a tolerance break from
[SPEAKER_01]: these?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so what is a tolerance break?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the what is the point of a
tolerance break for people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in general, the added benefit of a
tolerance break, there's a couple added
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits like the first added benefit of a
tolerance break is going to be to decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you are going to be able
to get a larger therapeutic effect from
[SPEAKER_01]: less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the that's the number one reason
why people want to take tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use to from my experience with CBD
and the trace amounts of THC and now CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm experiencing with, I don't
experience a tolerance effect because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using them at relatively low doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just means that like I'm not taking
more every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking the same amount every single
day and I'm still getting the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not experiencing tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that reason, like in number one,
like there is not really a need for a
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance break in that one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of like, that's the first reason
to have a tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second reason is kind of like a lesser
reason to have a tolerance break would be
[SPEAKER_01]: just to like judge your perspective of
like whether or not something is working
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, whether or not it's having a
negative effect on your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have taken breaks for for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually one of the main reasons
why I take regular THC breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the reason why I stopped drinking a
couple of years ago just to like read just
[SPEAKER_01]: to check in, right, to check in and being
like, how is this affecting my life?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is this affecting my health?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me personally, the giant added
therapeutic benefit that I get from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CBD, now CBG and trace amounts
of THC plus plus whatever else is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that we're talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the terpenes and the flavonoids and,
you know, bioactive fatty acids and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those benefits that I receive that
increase my quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it far to me, it is far
outweighing any negative effect that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: having on my health, of which I don't see
any negative effect on my health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I'm determining for
myself, although I have seen doctors that
[SPEAKER_01]: say that I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring us back to the sharp edge
point on the question, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, you know,
we've been talking about so far in this
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, like THC and how you do your
tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically, the question is,
are tolerance breaks beneficial for CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG and THCA?
[SPEAKER_00]: They work the same way, yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they're acting on different
receptors, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I think that that's like the
main thing to point out is that all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these rare cannabinoids that have
different pharmacologies, when you take
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance breaks from them, you'll be
affecting different receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be a similar thing, though,
where you're like resensitizing your your
[SPEAKER_01]: body to the molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I haven't really seen a lot of
people developing, unless they're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not like the most knowledgeable
person on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from other people
what they think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, developing a tolerance,
it seems like at least THC develops a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty rapid tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's easy for the CB1 receptors to
be downregulated and then for you to get
[SPEAKER_01]: less of that intoxicating effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe with the other rare
cannabinoids, and maybe I also haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: looked hard enough, because to be fair,
like, there's not a lot of information out
[SPEAKER_01]: there on the other rare cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very interested to hear from
people if they develop tolerance to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other rares and like what that looks like
and what it would look like for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: take tolerance breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common background of this is,
since this whole set three is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is focused on dosing thresholds for
efficacy in chronic and serious illness,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are generally folks that have got
some combination of serious things like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, MS in RA, Lupus in RA,
you know, Lupus Hashimoto Epstein-Barr RA,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people who have got serious
dysfunctions in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these folks describe this experience
of going, bouncing from solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: solution because their body adapts to the
solutions quickly and their suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is incredibly common for me to
hear from these, these, these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these high difficulty patients that,
yeah, I did, you know, CBD worked for five
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and then it stopped working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I moved on to CBG and CBG helped
decrease the inflammation for a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it stopped working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they moved on to mushrooms and
then that worked for a while and that
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, so then I went back
around to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, CBD was now working again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so many of these patients,
they hop from method to method to method
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to, I mean, and, and they're even
switching from drugs that have different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods of action, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even always the method of
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as if they need to keep, um,
goosing their immune system with different
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to refresh in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's these folks that are looking
for any way to refresh their body's
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to these natural plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you said, you know,
you know, inaccurately that you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: break from, from CBD, people were all over
this because they're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do, should we not be taking our
breaks from CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the answer is actually,
yeah, they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it also depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who have really high
inflammatory and chronic disorders,
[SPEAKER_01]: like this is, again, I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a medical professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a nutritionist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just my opinion of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's not just the
cannabinoids that I use to manage my
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic disorders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have altered pretty much every other
aspect of my life that you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could, I shape my entire life
around my chronic mental health,
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain, and chronic GI issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try and maintain the lowest possible,
like systemic inflammation levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we talked about inflammation in
the last one, I think inflammation is at
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart of a lot of these problems,
specifically immune system problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say as just as advice,
in my opinion, is that you have to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: way to potentiate the cannabinoids,
you have to find a way to make them more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of ways you can do
that, right, like by modifying your diet,
[SPEAKER_01]: modifying your fasting, or like your
eating window, I take, I take cold showers
[SPEAKER_01]: and do breathing exercises, right,
like people who've heard of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like stretching,
yoga, mental health work, like cardio,
[SPEAKER_01]: like low grade cardio, strength training,
like working out, like there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all of these other options that
you could do that potentiate, they
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the efficacy of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that for a number of reasons,
those things are extremely difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they feel like this all, I mean,
when I say all of them out loud,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, oh, my God, I can't believe I
do all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really like about one at a time
and certain things will work for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: people more, more than others,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't tell you what has worked for
me or like has any of the have any of
[SPEAKER_01]: those one things work for me or is it the
combination that of all of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that are somehow working together?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a really good point is to
bring us back to the holistic nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I, while I know that the,
the, the inflammation patients that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I, I've worked with would,
would howl at the idea that, that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: weight training, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they, they lift things because
most of them feel so broken and weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body doesn't really know, I mean,
for this application, the body doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know the difference between a one
pound weight and a 20 pound weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it knows is that it's, it's being put
into a stress and release of the muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is going through the,
the body actions that, that respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is healing and efficacy in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I like the fact that you
recognized the mental impossibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: that for these patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet just find something heavier than
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just, or just nothing, just body
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with what, you know, start with what
is good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm, I have hypermobility issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I injure myself really, really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't lift like, I mean, now that I've
been lifting for a while, I've been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase like my weights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's, it's, it's all about
what you're comfortable with and what
[SPEAKER_01]: actually brings things to, to your life
and that are, that are manageable to you
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's like the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like what you said about a one
pound weight, I mean, you do a one pound
[SPEAKER_01]: weight for six months, it'll turn into a
five pound weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do that for another six months,
it'll turn into a 10 pound weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get to 20, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Miyabi, thank you so much for
joining me again on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed our first interview for part one
so much that I was glad that you were open
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a part two in endocannabinoid
mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people love it, you know, to be able
to hear this level of scientific detail
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, from a scientist who is
able to put it in layman terms,
[SPEAKER_00]: human terms, is a real joy for most of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you so much for sharing your
expertise and good cheer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I really, I really enjoy your
questions and your listeners must be,
[SPEAKER_01]: they must be a pretty sharp bunch,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't, I mean, in terms of like the
lay, in terms of layman type stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questions are not layman questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I'm pretty stoked with the
Shaping Fire audience too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, people come here when they want to
get serious and I'm grateful they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you, Miyabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have missed part one of
endocannabinoid mechanics with Dr. Miyabi
[SPEAKER_00]: Shields, you can go back and enjoy Shaping
Fire episode number 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fabulous and you should definitely
check it out if you just started with this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn more from
Miyabi, I strongly suggest that you follow
[SPEAKER_00]: their social media, which is just
absolutely filled with rich content and
[SPEAKER_00]: how I found out about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more reliable platform for that right
now seems to be Instagram and their
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is at Miyabi PHD and that's
M-I-Y-A-B-E-P-H-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Instagram seems to be the best place to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, the secret is that the
TikTok material is actually more fun for
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment and the TikTok keeps deleting
Miyabi's account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, it is also at Miyabi PHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow both the Instagram account and
the TikTok account to stay up on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, festive cannabinopathic learning
with Miyabi.
