[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who don't know,
I'll start with Jeff on the far side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Lowenfels is a, you know,
45 plus year gardening author out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of us in this room know him from
his Teaming with Microbes, Teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi, and Teaming with Nutrients series
of books, which is like essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Grail trilogy for people who love
this kind of stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he has also got a new book coming
out in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: All about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to check out parts of it as
it went to the publisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very much an introduction to auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I see Jeff as an
evangelist for auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to his right is my other good
friend, Seth Crawford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you may know him as a
co-founder with his brother Eric of Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD Seeds near Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're focused on heavy duty,
non-GMO, heavy analytical breeding there
[SPEAKER_00]: at their laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the goal of developing particular
chemovars that can target particular
[SPEAKER_00]: symptom issues for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have figured out the CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on their way to the varins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much to the joy and chagrin of cannabis
farmers throughout the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds continually get outstripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as many as they produce,
everyone just then goes and buys those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with people vote with their
wallets, people are voting for Oregon CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, gentlemen, for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have a sip of water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then off we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people may understand that autos
finish faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean the best application
for autos are readily apparent to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to hear you both,
starting with you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will autos influence cannabis growing
and horticulture going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me give two different answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book, as you indicated, is really an
introductory book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say it's a book for your sister
and your brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a book for your Uncle Bob and Aunt
Sally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a book for a professional grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm convinced that autoflour cannabis is
going to change the general population's
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude about cannabis, because it's the
next tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a lifetime, I'm 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: This only happened to me once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a lifetime, a new plant is
introduced to the general horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening public.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time it happened, it was the snap
pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took over the pea world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every gardener grows snap peas a
couple of times during their career and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to happen,
I think, to these autoflours, because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their quality has risen so high as a
result of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the first answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second answer is, this is a plant
which you can grow on a deck, which you
[SPEAKER_02]: can grow outside in a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in a perennial bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in a pot in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's something that is accessible
to all growers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just people who have big farms or
a big greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they don't have a photo
period, it means that people who live in
[SPEAKER_02]: northern climates like Alaska,
where on September 21st, your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: finally gets the darkness that it needs to
set flower, you also get a frost that
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, for those who do
professionally grow, here's a plant which
[SPEAKER_02]: you can use to interspace between your
plants as they veg, the same thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants as they flower, you just put
them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care what the light is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give them 20, 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to flower based on their
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can use your spare space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a dream for the entire
horticultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seth, I know you're coming from a
little different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff and I share that we're very
interested in home growers and patient
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your customers and the people you are
talking to, I mean, I know you're a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: patient guy, so I'm not saying you're not
into patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your customers are very demanding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are you seeing as far as the
advantages for auto flowers for folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing at a scaled level at acreage
size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I would say, since this is going
to be on the internet forever,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is for posterity, go back and take a
look if you're very interested about
[SPEAKER_01]: geeking out on some of the historical
background on ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the technical term for auto
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis is Latin for derived from
ruderal, which is rubble, from the rubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are plants that can grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow where it freezes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow through frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow in very, very crazy
situations and actually finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick at industrial scale is really
being able to get them in the ground at
[SPEAKER_01]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that's a direct seeding or
transplanting before the plant goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through stress, there's some underlying
genetic mechanisms that lead the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: go directly into flower when it senses a
stressful situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to step back for a second,
because of that posterity sake,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look for that geek out moment at
Ernie Smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie Smalls is a Canadian researcher
who's been working on cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_01]: issues for the last 45 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is the person that was responsible
for coming up for the industrial hemp 0.3
[SPEAKER_01]: THC rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back and look at his earlier
writings, it was based on taking a leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: off at the top of the plant rather than
testing the top eight inches of flower at
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, that's going to be incorporated
into the USDA rules as they move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: with the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2018, he wrote a seminal paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that this is going to go down as
one of those testaments to auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paper is about highlighting the fact
that these day-neutral auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants represent really the peak in human
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a lot of other crops, the reasons
and rationales that we have for expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: the total productivity of each individual
crop on a per-acre basis has come down to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeders, geneticists, et cetera,
over long periods of time being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the plants more compact, make them
more uniform, and take wild types of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that tend to have seeds in varying
places on the plant and consolidate them
[SPEAKER_01]: into a usable machine harvestable,
really energy-dense organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been true for many of the other
crops that have been domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie Smalls goes so far as to say that
that is the most profound thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen in over 13,000 years of human
agriculture is this move towards,
[SPEAKER_01]: he calls them semi-dwarf or dwarf
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the title of the paper is Dwarf
Germplasm, and essentially it's about how
[SPEAKER_01]: to get tremendously large yields both for
food crops, if you're growing for seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully in places where they're not
growing for senesemia or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also for cannabinoid production in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about being able to maximize
the space, minimize the inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really allow both farmers and people
who benefit from these compounds to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more access to them and to benefit from
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And auto flowering plants are tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to revisit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe we ought to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these plants, if you're not familiar
with auto flowers, two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, they'll start to flower in
18 days up to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just flower, period, which is
pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing about them is
that you can overdo it with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant that grew quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were discovered in about 1900,
1903.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientists found them in the Volga River
area in Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: He described it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had low THC or no THC, and so they
basically forgot about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the 70s, people started to
say, hmm, maybe we could breed these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the breeding happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2003, a guy was able to
successfully commercialize one called
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowrider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the ultimate heirloom kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not a land race, really,
I don't think, anymore, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: heirloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can breed these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They flower in 18 days, third week.
[SPEAKER_02]: By nine weeks, they're finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: You harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, the breeding potential and
opportunities on these things are just
[SPEAKER_02]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the opportunity to be able to improve
on this plant, like we have, in theory,
[SPEAKER_02]: improved on some of our agricultural
plants, is absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I love about them is
that if you have got a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, but you don't really want to
supplement with light for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually do two cycles of auto
flowers without light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experimenting with that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest thing I ran into was
trying to keep them warm, because auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers don't particularly like to start
off their life with cold feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is you can start something
early spring and have it finish 4th of
[SPEAKER_00]: July and then put seeds in that same
no-till environment, let those pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're done by October 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've run two cycles and you don't
have to pull any tarp, which we all love
[SPEAKER_00]: to avoid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I wanted to hit on was
how appropriate these are for patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: for people with lower mobility,
because like Jeff mentioned, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: very compact plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These pretty much top out at around three,
three and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, you don't have to do
the reaching, and they're not hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the patient can stand up and look all
around them for mold instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with some of these nine-footers where
they're just impossible to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're beautiful, and I love them,
and I want to toke them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all caged and difficult to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that folks who are
living in an apartment, who are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a tent, can grow four of these together
with no sweat, and you don't even need to
[SPEAKER_00]: scrog them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're a patient, they're so
easy to use and always going to flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular time frame and be ready to go
that it really opens up the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not leave the impression that
these are little teeny baby flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're little teeny plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are some, I've seen colas
that are 80 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll have 10 of these colas on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are not the lowrider that you
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are a totally new plant ready for
prime time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to add on to that, so yes,
you can make them flower in general for
[SPEAKER_01]: field production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at about 77 days from the
time that the seed emerges in a starter
[SPEAKER_01]: plug, transplanted into the field within
the week, 77 days from that time of
[SPEAKER_01]: emergence until we harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Jeff is saying is absolutely
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see with regular photoperiod
plants is the stem and stock weight
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts for about 27.5% of the total
biomass of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these day-neutral plants,
you're looking at roughly 19%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an order of, talking about a
significant percentage of increased
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the one thing that I will say,
and it's a little bit of a brain bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: is try growing one of these in a 100
gallon smart pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice for patients or
someone who's just trying to experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: with one of these plants in a three gallon
container to have it on their deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very useful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stay small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to flip out if you hit
them with a porch light in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the night when you go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put one in a much bigger
container, you're going to notice that the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering system is genetically determined
based on stress and stress particularly to
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually grow five,
six, seven, eight, nine foot tall auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plants if they have enough root
space and they're not restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually, when we think about
cannabis, one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers always go back to is the
amazing plasticity of that plant and its
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to respond to the environment that
it's placed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowering plants, these day-neutrals
are, to me, it's the epitome of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to pull together something Jeff
just said and something you just said and
[SPEAKER_00]: take it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeff loves to talk about how these
scrappy little plants from Russia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put them in rocky, crappy soil and
they still very much thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have spoken to me before,
just like you just did to all of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's the stress of the roots hitting
the bottom of the pot that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never heard you give this example
before of these large 100 gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes me very interested in growing
an eight foot auto flower just to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they grow in soil then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you go right into the
ground, but there's no eventual bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has got to be something going on
scientifically that's positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the trigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: In part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things, there are many,
many different soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Willamette Valley, we're blessed
with a number of things, including we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get into this as we talk about farming at
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have in certain locations 38 feet
of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's properly prepared,
you can end up with very large plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had plants that were averaging
a pound and a half per plant planted very
[SPEAKER_01]: densely in the field just north of
Corvallis last summer for one of our R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to proper soil
preparation and the ability for those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots to just go out and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the book, I stress that from the
perspective of an amateur growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: things, they don't really like to be
repotted all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always tell people to grow them in
the original container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out with three gallon containers
because I thought the plants were cute and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something they call it now
super auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really the same thing,
but different soil structure and different
[SPEAKER_02]: soil amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm telling people five gallons is
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ubiquitous hardware bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seven gallons is even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put the seed right in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even start them in a,
because I think if they are stressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the worst thing you can have is
something that flowers when it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh no, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not cheap seeds,
although you can grow your own seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they become cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's disappointing when they're five
inches tall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually did that for my first time
and I can admit to making that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first tray last year, I still like my
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a root riot plugs,
which I like because when I find when I
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate right into soil, it's a lot more
difficult to keep the seed in a moist
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the soil dries out really fast,
whereas those root riots, while they are
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll put the seed in there,
let it pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I've got firmly established
cotyledon leaves, then I go ahead and I
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in before the roots are coming out
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do make some cute little plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I saw a little plant growing in a
thimble with a, you know, it had a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful little head on it about that
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a sexy little thing,
you know, it was just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of thing you put on Instagram and go,
hey, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody goes, whoa, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a tray of these, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a tray of these and I let them sit
too long in the tray before I,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're right, you said,
you know, that same week, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let them sit to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a tray of very expensive,
beautiful eight inch auto flowers and each
[SPEAKER_00]: one had this gorgeous big nug on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the yield per weight was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield per $15 seed was not,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm growing my own and still paying $15
a gram, which is like not a win,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they made awesome gifts to people
because you give somebody a small plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with this fully mature bud and you're
like, here you go, snip it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: like let it dry for a couple of days and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and actually, you know, I know we're
getting out of order here, but keeping in
[SPEAKER_02]: my idea that this is the next tomato,
I'm convinced that in the next future few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, you're going to be able to walk
into, you know, Whole Foods or wherever at
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas time and they're going to have a
little shelf and it's going to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 30 little auto flower plants
sitting there that look like little
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas trees that are decorated,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at Easter time, you know,
you're going to have plants with that
[SPEAKER_02]: little green plastic crap, you know,
around the base of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so much fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just cannot, you can, I'm peeing in my
pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to bring the conversation back
to medical, which obviously I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing this conversation back to you
because those are the people I work with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to keep going with you,
Jeff, and then we'll jump back to Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of medical, Jeff, I'd like you
to speak a bit to the ease of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard you talk about how you can
actually do too much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Seth, would you pick up,
since you are analytically breeding these
[SPEAKER_00]: to help with particular ailments,
I'd like to hear from you how the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: of auto flowers can be so tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can they be targeted because they're
so quick to cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but Jeff, let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, these are unbelievable
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just, you know, the only thing I
can compare it to is a marigold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I read a garden column in the
newspaper up at Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, marigolds are the one plant
I say, you know, you got to plant
[SPEAKER_02]: something or you're not a real gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you plant a marigold and you can have
your kid do it with you because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: only seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stick the seed in the ground,
it's like a sunflower seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain seeds, you just put them
in the ground and you walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't do anything and they grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow the way they're supposed to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens with these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put too much fertilizer in the
soil, if you put any fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't put any fertilizer the first time
you grow it because you may not need it
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to watch these plants
very carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow so quickly that, you know,
that when the white fly or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: decides to hit it, all of a sudden it's
gone through the stage where the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the right kind of juice is,
wait a minute, what happened to my plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the insect moves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these things don't need a lot of
care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you got to keep an eye out for mildew
and the kinds of things that you normally
[SPEAKER_02]: do, but they grow so quickly that if you
push them too much, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I do to mine to start,
when I buy a seed from somebody I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what, you know, whether it's going to
be any good, I put the mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: on it and that is all I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, I've never had to fertilize
any of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who grow indoors,
especially in tents, you don't really have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time to screw them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fantastic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had never heard your example,
Jeff, about the plant growing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of life that appealed to any
particular pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first round I did, I've got no mold
issues, no pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I live on Vashon Island,
we don't have that much pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always get mold, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that their life cycle is so
short, a lot of that stuff doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: time to take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been bred to get rid of the
mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know the people that grow with new
breed seeds, that's what they were looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for, mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get rid of that mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of being able to use these plants
for different medical conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always defer to Dr. Ethan Russo,
who is somewhere out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to speak to exactly what
type of compounds are going to help for
[SPEAKER_01]: particular ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we know is that all of these different
compounds are very useful in trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out exactly how to triangulate and
make use of those compounds and get them
[SPEAKER_01]: into plants in a way that's useful for
patients and for people across the world
[SPEAKER_01]: is really our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at different plants from a
breeding perspective, what we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do is we need photo period
plants for very particular locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need plants that are going to flower
early but are still photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need auto flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can deploy these plants in
basically, once you've developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular chemo bar, you can deploy them
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what makes these
different compounds available to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having CBD varieties, having CBG
varieties, CBC rich plants, more
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly now working on CBDV,
CBGV, and CBCV, along with other minor
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that we don't even know how to
quantify and don't have reference
[SPEAKER_01]: standards for.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just from a patient perspective,
being able to grow it at home and take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of your own family or take care of
yourself through the joy of actually
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something emancipatory about being
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody feels that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to make sure that those
compounds are available at scale at a
[SPEAKER_01]: price that individuals can actually afford
to treat themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants make that possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: One good example of that is being able to
use the plasticity of auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for a particular ecological niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people here are probably familiar
with how much grass seed the Willamette
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Willamette Valley is home to 95% of
the world's grass seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to grow grass seed in the
Willamette Valley for better or for worse
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the climate that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't normally get rain in the
Willamette Valley through the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: July up until the middle of August.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a month of, generally speaking,
very, very dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows a competitive advantage of
grass seed farmers who have good
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation and great soil to be able to
grow this particular crop, cut it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: field dry it, it sits in the field for
five to seven days, and then it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: combined and picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other place in the world has that
steady climate that allows for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, even though most people like
food rather than lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one else is able to really do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually do the same thing and use
this ecological advantage paired with a
[SPEAKER_01]: technological and horticultural advantage
by using these auto flowering plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant thousands of acres of very rare and
useful compounds that are present in these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants after specific breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow them out and dry them in a way that
doesn't require a huge drying
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure that you would have to have
for other crops or in other locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a huge step forward in terms
of being able to make these compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: available, make them an everyday thing so
that you can literally walk into any
[SPEAKER_01]: supermarket and find something that is
useful in targeting a particular malady.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to figure out exactly what
those compounds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two follow up questions for you,
Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, I hear from a lot of
folks when I, I've become kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: evangelist for auto flowers because I'm so
into them, but people come up to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, we don't want auto flowers
because we can't breed with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not for everybody and I want my
nine foot plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you already dispelled the short plants
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know they were taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like that you just said that there
are particular nature environments where
[SPEAKER_00]: you want the photo period, some that are
photo period but finish early,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not heard that analysis before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you go a little more in depth in
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we still need the other two
categories?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's nice to have diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we need them to breed with because
the land race strains are photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, we need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good example is when we're, this is
something that a lot of us living in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a black market, it was difficult to be
able to get information about the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: people produce in other areas of the
country or other areas of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great example is Kentucky and Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kentucky and Tennessee have incredibly
wet July, August and September's and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the very end of September and
then through October they have perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like what Oregon is like in
late August, early September before the
[SPEAKER_01]: rains hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as most of us know, here we need to
make sure that our plants are out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, taken care of, harvested,
dried, properly handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not done by the middle of
September, you're really pushing yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really chancing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those areas, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to actually get your plants out
at the end of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that case, a long season,
a full season photo period sensitive plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is really the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you, if you have a,
if you have an auto flowering plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain areas, you can plant your auto
flowers in early May, go back and replant
[SPEAKER_01]: in mid July and end up getting two crops
and basically double the productivity of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you have available to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, unless you live in Alaska where you
like to have six plants, three of which
[SPEAKER_02]: are allowed to be in flower, you know,
so I always tell people, don't treat this
[SPEAKER_02]: like broccoli, you know, where you plant
it all at once, you stagger it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean you wait for the crop to
harvest, you know, every two weeks or
[SPEAKER_02]: every week you put in a couple of more
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the regulator comes to your
house, you go, no, I only got three in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, you know, forget the fact that I
got 50 pounds of drying weed over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but they really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you say, again, sort of
emphasizes the idea that boy, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that a home gardener would,
you know, people grow heirloom tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Mary, Mary, next door neighbor,
she's famous because she's got the Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: summer spring and, and George next door is
famous because his are plum tomatoes that
[SPEAKER_02]: make the best sauce, you know,
and they give them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's the same thing that's
going to happen with these auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, look at the colors on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the landscape capabilities on this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not, they're going to be
landscape plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be a plant that everybody
accepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get rid of that stigma,
but it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the plant that's going to
carry us over the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm convinced and help the big plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like what you said too about
neighbors sharing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if, if we all have got plant
limits, we're limited by our variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just like tomatoes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you grow tomatoes at home,
you're still going to end up buying
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like commercial tomato growers
are all hosed because we're all growing at
[SPEAKER_00]: home tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the ones at the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the seeds so you can grow them
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but this is another great idea
because neighbors can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow different varieties and trade and it
creates increased community and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to try more wheat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a win as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year in the, at the Alaska state
fair, they actually, in Kenai,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a cannabis entry thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm convinced every, every state fair
in the country is going to have a auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flower cannabis contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it's just, this is the
best thing that ever happened to our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry because it's going to get mom and
pop and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get mom and dad and uncle
Bob and Aunt Sally who normally would be
[SPEAKER_02]: against it into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we really need so we can
get the taxes out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that they are a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: From a breeding perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we make feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can come to me with a good
argument as to what is actually contained
[SPEAKER_01]: in the male genome that's useful and how
you can access and figure out what those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits are, I'm open to having my mind
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what science is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that we operate is that we
make feminized seed and we use females
[SPEAKER_01]: because it allows us to know what the
chemo type is, to know what the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles are, to know what the potency is,
the flower structure, and then be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how that's inherited from
generation to generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowering plants are a different
animal in the sense that when you plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that seed, that clock is ticking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go, oh, hey, that's a great
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just re-veget and get some cuttings
off of it and use it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example of this, last year I was
working through, had about 20 different
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG-rich plants trying to figure out what
the average ratio of CBG to THC was to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify which plants we could use or at
least what the frequency was for
[SPEAKER_01]: developing really, really high-ratio
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the individuals from that
population, we sent the results into a
[SPEAKER_01]: third-party lab after we tried to screen
them in-house, and they came back and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, whoa, 50% of your total cannabinoid
profile was a compound that we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a cannabinoid from its
molecular weight, but we don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: reference standards to be able to identify
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Pixis in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a very good lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have more cannabinoids available to
them than most labs in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and very good equipment, very well-trained
personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person I was interacting with
said, can you send me another sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm tearing my hair out saying that
was the only plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you go back and grow hundreds of
those plants out, and you never find that
[SPEAKER_01]: same plant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a structured breeding program,
when you're trying to isolate these
[SPEAKER_01]: individual compounds and turn them into
useful field-ready or home-grower-ready
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, it poses a significant challenge
because you only have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have literal professionals now working
at our company who are trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: other ways of making this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a significant technological
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways around it, but it takes a
ton of space, a ton of time, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation to really be able to isolate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a different animal when it comes
to the breeding standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's from a professional
perspective, from a real amateur
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take two auto-flowering plants and
breed them together, you can breed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine weeks, holy crow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, I think I'll name
this after my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the big guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea that you can get somebody's
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've got to be careful when I talk
about genetics in this conference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little side joke here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get somebody's great genetics,
and you say, gee, I wonder if,
[SPEAKER_02]: as an amateur, can I fool around?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fool around with this stuff a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you're not as exact as these guys,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fool around with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do it all winter long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under 20 hours of light, you can do it
all night long.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fun, fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a professional grower,
you've got to adjust yourself a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But boy, if you are a professional grower
and you're growing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: get into these auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can improve the ability to get
more medicine out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really important point,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up the historical reference
back to the lowrider varieties from 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a shitty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just made me sick to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene profile was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure was not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could see the promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see the promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it took was small-time breeders
who were working under either medical
[SPEAKER_01]: programs or in their garage,
surreptitiously, to improve those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until 2010 that I finally
consumed something that changed my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: about auto-flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had taken one of DJ Short's
blueberry varieties, Mircein dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a number of different minor terpenes
that end up making it a very calm
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-anxiety experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a beautiful piece of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they finally instilled that into an
auto-flowering plant that made the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and the flavor just as good or better than
a lot of the other commercially available
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The early ones were interesting,
but they weren't any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there's a listserv called
autoflowering.net, which we kid about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw me off because I got on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, gee, I'm writing this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they threw me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I finally, thanks to Shango,
got back on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ted Hesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they first started, and you would
be on Grass City or one of those other
[SPEAKER_02]: forums, and you say, oh, I'm growing
auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made fun of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you were drummed out of the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody started the autonet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go back the way, people were
just sort of struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And around 2008, 2009, somewhere right in
that area, they hit the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they started laughing at other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pictures, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on Instagram just yesterday,
I saw one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had one of these movies where it
went from seed to harvest in two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crow, fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you folks, get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to love these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to buy feminized seeds for my
own home growing and to help patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because being able to take males out of
the mix, if you're not breeding them,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, there are still lots of
auto-flower seeds that are being sold
[SPEAKER_00]: regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just want the flowers and
you don't want to play with the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Jeff is suggesting, get yourself some
fantastic, modern, feminized seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephistogenetics or somebody who's got a
good reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all very plug and play,
just like Jeff is describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to enjoy that extra
horticultural experience of making
[SPEAKER_00]: something that did not exist in the world
until you did it, find yourself a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: auto-flower reg seeds and pop a couple of
them that you think sound interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really easy to collect male
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a branch and put it in a bag and
you shake it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a bag of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you walk to the other side or maybe
your friend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put some of that pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you paint it onto one branch of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're done, next year
you're going to have like 40 or 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you get to name it,
which can be the most fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to wait till next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things grow indoors really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Anchorage, we're really excited about
the opportunity to grow these things
[SPEAKER_02]: because we get a photo period the same
time we get the frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is going to just change our
whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So auto-flowers, as you just heard from
talking about the lowrider, old Keemabar,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people nowadays still consider
them cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But professionals are like, man,
this is just something on the side that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to matter to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you meet Seth and you walk acre
upon acre of these beautiful plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air is filled with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, I want to lay up my tent and
just live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to hear from you both
are commercial applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, let's talk about yield
and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's one thing that it's all
incredibly easy and we can grow them in
[SPEAKER_00]: tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are thinking about
scale for commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, am I going to get enough flour
for my effort for home growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like you both to speak to that
option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here in Oregon, I would start with
new breed seeds, frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first ones to get their
license to be able to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are growing for commercial
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time I spoke to them,
they said, yeah, selling the seeds at the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary is just a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are lots of commercial growers
that are using these things for a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the ones we've already discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing indoors on racks,
if you get the right size plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: double racks, triple racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the whole ceiling,
all the way up to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: The space on these things make it so that
you can interspace them in between
[SPEAKER_02]: existing plants, which is really a useful
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already got the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already got the light if you're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to interspace a little
small plant that's not going to detract
[SPEAKER_02]: from the bigger plants that you're trying
to grow there is a double your ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: get more income as a result of doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that regard, it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the idea that you can
get something in seven, nine, if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go longer, 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from a commercial perspective,
if the yield is good and the power is
[SPEAKER_02]: good, if that's the terpene spectrum,
you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to grow anything but?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really highly encourage you to try
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really quite something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to contact people like New Breeze
Seeds and get names of other commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all share information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm glad you reminded me of that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you answer, I want to plug with the
correct URL, autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Jeff's story was spot on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the people who were laughed off
of other forums for using autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they decided to create their own
where they could be misfit toys together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we've lost
in our scene, I think, as people have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten more money focused, is everybody's
got IP now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants to hide and protect
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, outside of just not
wanting to go to jail, people were really
[SPEAKER_00]: open to sharing within the community,
sharing best practices, swapping seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this kind of stuff, which you're
seeing less on the commercial side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're still seeing on this group at
autoflower.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are all trying to learn from
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sharing best practices because
they haven't mattered for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really excites me to see some of
the leaders in that particular community
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what things are going to be like
in three or four years when autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: just falls off people's lips so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people will be the new
generation of superstars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love an underdog story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have some of the best bud porn I
have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the photos are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seth, going back to you, specifically,
the people that you are sowing seed to are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at acreage size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to give people pitches
about your seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for the sake of this
conversation, what does that pitch sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like when they're all like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to plant a whole field of
these what are essentially still probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be smaller plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of the company again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we don't advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe you like five emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't handle the advertising right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, we don't pitch it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come to us and say, hey,
I really want to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say, no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us three years to figure out how
to get the plants in the field without
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering in trays and actually getting a
good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're moving on to large scale
field trials for different density of
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've stepped back, and we're actually
putting it into the hands of much more
[SPEAKER_01]: competent farmers who've been farming
other crops for their entire lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's such a technical question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different kinds of plants,
roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: One.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of different varieties
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it's not about cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours are chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at plants as having very
particular chemical compounds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: replicable generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it comes down to trying to
figure out how you, in the same way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're describing maximizing space in a
small area inside, this is how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize the productivity on a per acre
basis over thousands of acres?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really comes down to what we've
seen with successful farmers is either
[SPEAKER_01]: direct seeding, which is rot with all
kinds of problems that most of you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably don't care about, but it all
comes down to the depth of the planting of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about literally
millimeters will make or break success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other side of it is the
density of planting for both weed
[SPEAKER_01]: suppression and to minimize lateral
branching and force the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically just turn into one solid flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what we're looking at this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would say for 2020,
yeah, definitely, we'll be ready for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy auto flowering seeds, both type 3
CBD-rich plants and type 4 pure CBD lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the other advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means clearly the short cycle is great
for scaled agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I visited your farm, you were
mentioning some other things like the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants are uniform, so they're
really easy to repeat, cut on a sled,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut on a sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the traditional farming
advantages of this plant versus the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one, and again, it's going to
depend on your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain areas, you can't cut the plant
down and let it dry in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people have had questions
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team did some amazing experiments this
last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long hours in the field, very hot
conditions, harvesting about 15 acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was about 38,000 plants in
early August, cutting them down,
[SPEAKER_01]: laying them down in the field to basically
cook at 100 degrees during the day and
[SPEAKER_01]: then grind them up and put them into totes
just to see how much CBD would be lost and
[SPEAKER_01]: what the terpene loss was going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was about, you're going
to lose about two-thirds of your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they vaporize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still enough to be able to get
some efficacy from entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the type of terpenes that
you're working with and their volatility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heavier sesquiterpenes tend to stick
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The really volatile monoterpenes are
always going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moral of the story on that was
that CBD content did not change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no statistical difference
between plants that were cut down and
[SPEAKER_01]: dried in the field versus plants that were
cut down and hung up in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's a great thing if you
happen to have a very dry late July,
[SPEAKER_01]: early August.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a rainy period,
that may not necessarily be the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really about, like any farming or
any cannabis production, it's about being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use the plasticity of the plant to
adapt to your own local ecosystem and
[SPEAKER_01]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seth, I'm going to give you a
particular question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to sniggle it off topic,
but it's very important for where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to ask you is,
you have particular experience in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dangers of pollen contamination,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since both feminized and regular auto
seeds exist, I think this would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: moment for you to make your pitch for not
running males outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love you to share the story about your
valley just to make everybody more aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dangers of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a pollinated crop and you're
growing outside, you're going to lose 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: of your total cannabinoids and 50% of your
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed is a tremendous energy sapping
creation that ends up taking the power
[SPEAKER_01]: away from your plants and reducing not
only the profitability, but the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of cannabinoids that you can
harvest outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Oregon, at this point we're trying
to launch a nonprofit organization that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of creating buffer zones between
farms so that we don't have issues of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Oregon Cannabis Pinning
Association, ocpa.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only thing I'll advertise today,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really just kind of in a,
we're trying to raise awareness this year
[SPEAKER_01]: and then actually move into a more formal
pinning system for 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pollen outdoors is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of people who are
either growing regular male female seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: or trying to create seed outdoors just
because you can produce so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tremendously productive way to make
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've had to basically go to a lot of
small time breeders who are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man, this is the big rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that I can make a
bunch of seed this year and then sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not knowing that in doing so, not only are
they not going to get a successful crop
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's other people who are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have a contaminated crop
yourself with no purity that you won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to sell if you're a moral or ethical
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also going to destroy all of
your surrounding neighbors' ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow a crop and have something
that's valuable at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really comes down, it's a touchy
subject for a lot of people, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely, in terms of being able to
create an environment that we all can
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to produce cannabis in and an
environment that our kids can potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to produce cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is one of those really,
really lucky spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have great breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good land.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really need to make sure that we
can protect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pollen travels a long ways,
long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that these pollen exclusion
zones, which I've been calling them,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have an actual official name for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pollen exclusion zone, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been calling it to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time that Seth posted about
this on their Instagram, I was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thread was mostly people saying,
you will not tell me what to do with my
[SPEAKER_00]: property, damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsanto, you want to control the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get where people are coming from,
because I don't like to be told what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is, it's an economic and
horticultural opportunity for right where
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of us live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing is that,
just like Napa Valley, they are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: world class wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain things that the
community has all agreed to do and not do
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't screw up the wineries
and their ability to grow grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it brings so much economic power
to the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's what I see for these
beautiful valleys throughout Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've already got hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a burgeoning industry that is light
years ahead of many of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the world that are going to try
to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a lead, even though I
don't want anybody to tell me what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with my property either, I really hope
that those people would keep open minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the reasons for not growing
pollinating cannabis plants outdoors make
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of sense for the Oregon community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is lost on a lot of
people, because they haven't let their
[SPEAKER_00]: ears be open to the argument yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people think it's about control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with this is that it's not
about trying to prevent people from making
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage people to go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've said before, it's emancipatory
not only to grow it, but to breed it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's part of what makes us human.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all could probably agree that people
have a right to fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a fire on your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool until it jumps your fence and
burns down your neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, that's your liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone in Oregon has a right to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have a right to exclude
other people from being able to engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful economic activity that not only
is helping themselves, but helping other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't the general motto?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fun ends when the other guy's
displeasure begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you do not have a right to plant
seeds outside, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a right to do it,
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to impact your neighbor,
you don't have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, for folks who are thinking about
doing three, four plants in your backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to bring in a male,
that's way different than we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing acres of regular seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're next door to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to take, because of that,
and we don't want to stop anybody from
[SPEAKER_01]: having that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be able to protect our interests,
we had to make sure that our greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: are sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only make seed in places that we're
comfortable making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once it comes out, we still have
to test it just to make sure that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: what we think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to let you know that Seth practices
what he preaches, it is really crazy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into their breeding warehouses or
greenhouses because they are they suck you
[SPEAKER_00]: in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that none of the pollen escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open it, they've got all the air
being pulled into a filter so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: open the door and you're like,
and then you're sucked in so that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is kept inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He had straight hair before he went in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I want to hit,
because we're wrapping up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I want to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a little bit of the breeding
analytics stuff and talk specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: about the smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most everybody in here probably
enjoys the taste and the experience of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've smoked the stuff that you grow
for extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the stuff that you grow for
extraction, like let's tear up these
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take them home and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, god damn, this is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is really good flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's hit on just real quickly the
fact that it may be convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be great for the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be good for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be extractable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good smoke too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with you, Jeff, because I know
that you love autoflower.net and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give your plug for autoflower taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'm a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I vaporize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I vaporize flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't combusted in maybe three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wonderful website incidentally
called FC Combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can guess what the FC stands for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these autoflowers, they taste just
like regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers on it, if you're into
numbers, I think it's a fool's game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't get stoned because your
number is only 6% THC, then take another
[SPEAKER_02]: hit, for god's sakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea that you got to buy a 30 to get
stoned is just so stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oils are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do it with other people,
a lot of times, my friends up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Anchorage, they go, man, these things grow
so fast they don't have time to rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, there's nothing bad tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the guy was very stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are just like regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would defy you to tell the
difference between vaporizing an
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower and vaporizing a regular photo
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no difference whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 65% to 70% of them are mere scene
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're seeing, it was fun to walk
through and take a look at the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: that were entered for the competition this
year and see the different terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and watch the evolution of what
growers and breeders are targeting at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go through and count how many are mere
scene dominant this year compared to years
[SPEAKER_01]: past versus terpenalene dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your fuel flavor, your diesel flavor,
terpenalene, beta-cariophyllene,
[SPEAKER_01]: alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that now emerge in
autoflowering plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit more difficult with
autoflowering plants just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that we were talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they definitely pack all of the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be perfectly honest, the potency as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of our type four high CBG varieties
that we've developed, the individual plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that has far and away had the highest
overall CBG percentage was an
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came in at almost 16% CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was over 17% CBGA before decarbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely possible to create
absolutely terpene-rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid-heavy, and diverse chemotypes
with these day-neutral plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that you're heavy in the
analytics, and you test everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do their numbers come out comparable to
photosensitive plants as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: On average, they tend to be a little bit
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also depends on the way that you
treat them in the light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they also have a little bit more
CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can change any of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: From an amateur grower, it seems to me
that there's always CBD in my autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure there is in my bigger
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBC, there is a little bit more CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least there tends to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually depends on the varieties
that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is definitely present in
autoflowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dispel another rumor about taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you spend a lot of time
breeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say, OK, so this is a
cookie's autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, that means that's cookies
crossed with a ruteralis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say that rutarute
plants taste like crap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have to say about people
saying that there's all this ruteralis
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes coming along for the ride?
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that used to be a valid
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things to consider as well
is normally what you're trying to do in a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program is look at the F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take two parents that are very
divergent, cross them, and then do either
[SPEAKER_01]: an open pollination or a targeted selfing
in the F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have F2 plants that exhibit
every possible combination or permutation
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where the most diversity is
expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a plant breeder, that's where
you should be looking for amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a specific terpene profile
that you're trying to target, you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: overlook that F1 cross, because that's
actually where you would identify the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that have the most similar profiles
to whatever it is that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I won't say very easily,
but you could take a GG4 and cross it to
[SPEAKER_01]: an autoflowering plant and then do your
initial selection in that F1, inbreed it
[SPEAKER_01]: one more time, and you can lock those
terpene profiles in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It obviously takes more time for
stabilization of traits and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But terpenes and making them taste good,
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're running out of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that you want to hear more
from both of these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for Jeff Lowenfels, you can find at
least one episode with him on the Shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire podcast, if you go to shapingfire
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have several of Jeff's
presentations at various conferences on my
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel at Ford slash Shango
Lowes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth has been on my show to talk about
both the new age CBD autoflowers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, and then again with a really
insightful interview on the nexus of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and hemp in the new economics of CBD from
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, don't forget about
Jeff's book coming out in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order it on Amazon today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can already pre-order it on Amazon
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you gentlemen for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.
Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
