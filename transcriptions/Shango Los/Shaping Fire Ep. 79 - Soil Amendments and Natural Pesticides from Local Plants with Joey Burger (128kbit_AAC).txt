[SPEAKER_01]: I love natural farming, and if you're
here, I bet you do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about all of my life is purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start my day with purchased toothpaste,
shave cream, and razor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on a computer I bought,
on internet I subscribe to, and listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: music I pay a monthly fee to have access
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lunch was bought mostly at the grocery,
and I put my dishes in a dishwasher with
[SPEAKER_01]: soap someone else made.
[SPEAKER_01]: My car, my home, this microphone I'm
talking into, nearly everything in my life
[SPEAKER_01]: is paid for, even the organic and holistic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my relationship with the plants is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually spend very little on
cultivation, and yet my plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer I cultivate, and the more I
learn, the easier it is to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: the less money I spend, and the less pest
pressure and problems I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the beauty of natural farming is
the more I slow down and learn about soil
[SPEAKER_01]: life and natural systems, the more I am
rewarded with good cannabis and good food
[SPEAKER_01]: for nearly no money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of natural farming, my
relationship with my plants is the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthiest relationship in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe for you too.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I'm
your host, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today my guest is Joey Berger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey is a universally respected
permaculture and natural farming educator
[SPEAKER_01]: and consultant in Humboldt, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an epic resume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey was certified in permaculture design
in 1998 and was certified to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started working in the cannabis
industry at age 12 and grew his first solo
[SPEAKER_01]: garden at age 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1996, Joey founded the seminal cannabis
supply store Trim Scene Solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald Triangle's source for
harvesting, processing, and extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that undersells Joey's
importance in the California medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: export markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey essentially provided the supplies to
the heart of the West Coast cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: producers exporting to the East.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey founded and served as president of
the Humboldt Growers Association in 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt's first medical cannabis growers
association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also a founding board member of the
Emerald Growers Association in 2011,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then went on to become the CGA,
the California Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Berger licensed his Mendocino farm,
the Mendo Hideout, in 2011 under Mendo's
[SPEAKER_01]: 931 program to grow legal medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same farm was raided just three years
later in 2014 after ordinance was repealed
[SPEAKER_01]: from 99 plants back down to 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: He founded the Casual Crop Exchange,
Humboldt's longest running medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farmers market in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that was shut down, he founded
the Casual Sundays Education Series to
[SPEAKER_01]: share regenerative practices with the
local community.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, Joey Berger received the highly
respected Dragonfly Earth Medicine Pure
[SPEAKER_01]: certification for his farm in Mendocino,
and he now inspects and certifies farms
[SPEAKER_01]: for dragonfly in the southern Humboldt
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joey Berger is presently permaculture
educator at Heartwood Mountain Sanctuary
[SPEAKER_01]: and a judge for Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we chat a bit about
assessing your property and common
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative improvements Joey sees on
cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the second set, we focus solely on
producing cultivation nutrients from wild
[SPEAKER_01]: plants already growing on your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third set is all about using
plants already on your farm for natural
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and pest discouragements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know a lot of what you do and
where you pretty much start all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations is assessing the property
that we're talking about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, your craft and like all
of our craft is growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very specific to the particular bio
region that we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the specific,
you know, plants and waterways and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bio region of our our actual
parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'd like you to do is let's start
by going through the kinds of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at when you first arrive at a
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like help us see through your eyes the
factors that are present on a property so
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, everybody who's listening
can use those same eyes either looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: their property that they own or in the
case of people who live in more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: suburban area, how they can look at like,
you know, their local parks and such for
[SPEAKER_01]: where they might be wild crafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us have your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, usually this starts with a phone
call long before I come out to anyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone contacts me, wants to have me,
you know, look at their property,
[SPEAKER_00]: do some permaculture design work or just
look at it through, you know, through my
[SPEAKER_00]: years of cannabis and permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over that phone call, we usually talk
about, you know, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your context?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a recreational cannabis farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a traditional market cannabis
farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a business?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you're actually looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear me talk about context
a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you want your lifestyle to
be like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you a workaholic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a place where you can
just raise your family and grow food?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we'll talk on the phone way
beforehand coming out to the farm you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, what are the natural resources you
have around there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just get a little bit of a
picture before I ever set foot on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to look at maps, send me some
topos, send me some aerial photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me your site plans from your
licensing so that when I go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: finally get some boots on the ground,
I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what neighborhood are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might know some of your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might know just from the area that
you're in, what are some of the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're out near the coast in Honeydew
or Petrolia, I'm here in southern Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're going to have horsetail on
your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this time of year,
you're going to have bracken fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have an idea based on,
you know, where you're at, what your
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you north face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you south face?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of conditions I can expect to
see once I get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we get onto that property,
believe me, I'm looking for plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: drive out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for, you know, history of
fires that have come through the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we down in a valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we up high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I seeing, you know, what are the soils
looking like as I'm driving out to your
[SPEAKER_00]: property to get an idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we down in Lake County and there's
serpentine rock or are we up in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt where there's redwood trees,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get onto the property, meet with the
clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the first things we like to
identify are these different sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your exposure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we on a south facing property that
gets a lot of sun, gets really good
[SPEAKER_00]: southern and western exposure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we on a north facing property that
gets very little light?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our elevation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the water on this property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the fire threats coming from on
this property?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of Humboldt County is very
mountainous and fire tends to travel up
[SPEAKER_00]: hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually pretty easy to identify
where are the fire threats going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: from on a property?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're in your house,
where's that fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: What direction is that fire going to be
coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the ingresses and egresses from
that property and will you be able to exit
[SPEAKER_00]: it if there is a fire coming your way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these other sectors are the wind
sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where are your winds blowing in
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, winds can be very damaging to
soils and to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really dry out soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it a lot harder for your plant
to just be healthy and do its natural
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identifying these sectors, we use a lot
of, we use some skills in permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: called zoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some principles that we use
where we can lay a farm out or a property
[SPEAKER_00]: out in zones, zones one through five,
with zone one being the zones that you
[SPEAKER_00]: visit the most every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be the areas right
outside your front door where you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want your little veggie garden for the
house and your little bit of herbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: your chicken coop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And zone five is going to be the very far
reaches of your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a wood lot or it might be an
area that you go just to gather,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gather some leaf mold out of the
forest a few times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at a property and we'll look
at, you know, what are the, what does your
[SPEAKER_00]: day to day look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put your garden that
you're going to be visiting every day on
[SPEAKER_00]: the far end of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put that close to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use some of these permaculture
design principles and they really help
[SPEAKER_00]: with that process and, and really just
identifying those sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the threats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the assets?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we capture the energy that's
hitting your farm and cycle it as many
[SPEAKER_00]: times before it leaves your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: That energy could be the sunshine hitting
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning we want to have as many levels of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have tall trees that are
capturing that sun at a tall height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have medium sized plants and
ground covers that we're capturing that
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine at every height before it leaves
the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to capture it with solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to capture it with a passive solar
design on our home so it can heat them
[SPEAKER_00]: during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to capture the rainwater as it's
falling and hitting the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cycle that through our property
as many times before it leaves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to run it through swales that are
going to spread the water out and sink it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground and our hoogle beds are
going to capture it and hold that water
[SPEAKER_00]: like banks and those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cycle that water through as
many plants before it leaves our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute it leaves your farm,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we identify all that energy
that's hitting your property and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: most use of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things we say in
permaculture is what's the biggest change
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make for the smallest effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really go out to these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to identify what are some of the
few biggest issues you're dealing with and
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can just fix those couple little
things, they could have a huge impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: your life or on the health of your farm or
on the quality of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes out here, those little
things, they're big things, they're little
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but oftentimes it's powdery mildew
or it's certain types of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big aphid issue the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leafhoppers was a big issue I saw the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's really about the farmer's
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we walking into?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your goals that you're trying to
accomplish?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we use these design principles
and your available resources to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the farmer's head for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see how... And actually,
I got to admit, I'm kind of surprised at
[SPEAKER_01]: how systemic the approach is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can almost feel the permaculture design
course that these ideas are from because
[SPEAKER_01]: so often when people come to the property,
they're focused more on how the property
[SPEAKER_01]: feels to them and the energetics of the
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to listen to you break it down into
the types of zones, I'm imagining more
[SPEAKER_01]: overlaid different types of maps of what's
happening at different levels of the
[SPEAKER_01]: property and how you can improve each one
of those different categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into the farmer's head for a
moment, when you go to these properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are... Let's just pick three.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are three of the common, let's say
either misconceptions or things that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers miss that can be most beneficial
to them that you see that are very common?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they're common to you,
chances are a lot of folks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening will get value from them as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, let's start with winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see people making these huge burn piles
and just burning everything, burning their
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks, burning their plant waste,
burning their tree trimmings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in fire country here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the largest fire in California
history, about four miles from my house
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a major drought right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have an even worse fire
year this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all need to be doing fire prevention
work over the winter, creating these
[SPEAKER_00]: defensible spaces, they call them,
clearing out around our buildings,
[SPEAKER_00]: clearing on the downhill sides of all our
buildings, all our entrances and exits to
[SPEAKER_00]: the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people clearing these fire
ladders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the lower dead branches on
trees, clearing out the dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we just burn those, those are
valuable resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are resources on your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we burn them, we're releasing CO2
into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adding to the hole in the ozone
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many things that we could do
with our cannabis stocks, with our plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: with our ganja waste, with our tree
thinnings, with these small firs that we
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to thin out here in our oak
woodlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we stockpile and process these
wastes, we turn them into resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about your cannabis waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your ganja stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be chipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be returned to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used as mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry, dry leaf as well can be just mulched
compost right back into the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: fed to your worms, put into a hugelkultur
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are valuable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever want to see anybody burning
their ganja stocks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one breaks my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love sitting around the campfire in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not burn our cannabis waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are nutrients that we took from the
soil, from our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to return them to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we harvest something and remove
it from our property, that's fertility we
[SPEAKER_00]: just removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to start thinking about how do
we return that back to the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as our forest thinnings,
a lot of those young firs can be processed
[SPEAKER_00]: and used as poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use those as junk pole fencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple wooden fences that we can
build out of those four to eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter straight poles, dug fir poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your thinnings out of the woods can be
chipped, used to build soil, used in your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, used as mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to talk about ramiel woodchip.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the branches from the smaller
deciduous trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to harvest these in the
wintertime and in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the trees, your deciduous trees
that lose their leaves in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your madrones and your maples.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the deciduous trees
around our parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use the branches that are
under three inches in diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller thinner branches that have
some bend to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are high in lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lignin is what makes branches flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these branches get older,
they get high in tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tannins are what's in hardwood,
makes the wood hard, makes it hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you chip these smaller ramiel
wood, these smaller branches, we use our
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit tree thinnings and we use these
smaller branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make a woodchip from this ramiel
wood, it's a very low carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio woodchip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means it's going to break down
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your normal hardwood woodchip high in
tannins takes a long time to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bury it, it's going to take a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ramiel woodchip, because it's smaller
pieces, it's high in the lignin,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes love to break this stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use this as essentially a top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use it as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, mix it into the top one
inch layer of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it gets some contact with the
soil, the microbes move into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: start breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to absorb and lock up a
bunch of nitrogen like your normal
[SPEAKER_00]: woodchip if you were to mulch with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ramiel woodchip is something we should
all be making all winter long,
[SPEAKER_00]: building fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good use for that wood waste is
biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all be making biochar all winter
long and using all these wood resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Big Pet Piva Mine is seeing
people burning their fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: burning their wood resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's please put an end to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big one I see, we've got snakes
out here and we have fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all do a lot of weed whipping out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grass grows up real tall in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful and green and then it dies
and you're left with this waist high grass
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a real fire threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really hides a lot of the snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got rattlesnakes around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a client last month whose father got
bit last year by rattlesnakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to put in a little plea here
to not weed whip down to the ground all
[SPEAKER_00]: around your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk to you right now about
something we call beetle banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beetles are some of the unsung heroes
of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beetles go in and they break down manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredible decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go in and they break down your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break down the compost and break down
the manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they like to hang out is in the
tall grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in there and hide in the tall,
shady grass during the daytime to hide
[SPEAKER_00]: from birds and to hide from other
predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we weed whip down to the bare
soil, all around our gardens and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: leave one little patch of grass standing,
we have just taken out a lot of habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to find a balance between
making our properties fire safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that dead grass down where it's
important and leaving as much of these
[SPEAKER_00]: undisturbed areas as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing a lot of this in my garden
this year is leaving big strips on unweed
[SPEAKER_00]: whipped right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means just native grasses and
bunch grasses that are three, four feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a shady habitat for these bugs
and snakes and all kinds of insects to
[SPEAKER_00]: hide out during the day during the hot
part of the day when they're easy prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you want to have a diverse
garden, diversity is strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity is health.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go into your garden, you should
see every bug, every insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means an aphid and a spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's a healthy, healthy balance
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's predators there keeping
them in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I walk into a farm and I don't see any
bugs, I get worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people have been spraying or
there's just not enough diversity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing there that anybody wants
to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to that's going to lead
to pest pressures and pathogen pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when people when people weed
whip their entire property, it's it
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes reminds me and is kind of akin
to lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand why people have gotten
more aggressive around about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: weed whipping their properties simply
because they don't want their properties
[SPEAKER_01]: to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, OK, I want to have there
be less fuel around my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by all means, you know, around your
house, you want to make sure that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you you've got things cleared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that you necessarily
need to clear every square foot of of your
[SPEAKER_01]: entire parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's there's there are
gradations here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's important to
understand that it's not all or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying leave the whole hillside
untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying leave a four foot wide by 20
foot long strip of native grass in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of your garden or on the edge of
your garden or on the uphill side where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to be a fire threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see you're saying more like make
islands, make islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beetles will travel 100 feet in
every direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make these islands around your garden
and put a water source there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little pond there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got drip emitters, put a saucer
under a few of those throughout your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a lot more wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a lot more snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be eating your rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when we get rodent damage
here, they're looking for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chewing the base of your stems and
extracting moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that when I leave out more
water around my garden, they leave my cash
[SPEAKER_00]: crops alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's what's another thing that you
you see commonly for this third one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something common that you see that
that you know, it's kind of a universal
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that folks do wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the pest pressures we get
are just because of let's talk poor air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow and monocropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we've got an issue here
in Humboldt County for the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, where they charge them for their
square footage of their pathways in
[SPEAKER_00]: between their cultivation areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really encourages the farmers to
pack everything in as densely as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leads to a lack of airflow and
increase in pest and and fungus pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm specifically talking about powder
mildew has just gotten worse and worse and
[SPEAKER_00]: worse here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, when you don't have good airflow
and you're not taking the time to go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean out the insides of your plants
and the bottoms of your plants and certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you've really got to clean them
out because they're just too leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, powdery mildew and and a lot of that
just has to do with a lot of times people
[SPEAKER_00]: are in poor greenhouses without adequate
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being in the in the correct structure
or being in the in the correct outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people just kind of stack the
deck against themselves when you go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse that doesn't have adequate
airflow and you've got a monocrop in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got a strain that isn't used to
these conditions and you're growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: near the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're just creating a perfect
storm for pathogens to move right in and
[SPEAKER_00]: just run rampant all over your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to the to the best of your ability,
you know, spread out your plants just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, across the entire property,
whether they're your ornamentals or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're your cash crop or whether or not
it's your food garden, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't don't be shy about maximizing your
space by spreading out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give everybody a room to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's segue a little bit over to
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talked a lot about the path
of water and the importance of of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, capturing and sequestering water
several episodes back when we talked with
[SPEAKER_01]: Nicholas from Green Source Gardens,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we talked with him a lot about,
you know, what to do in the off season to
[SPEAKER_01]: prepare your property for for the
following summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and one of the interesting things
that you just said to me was you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you know, obviously we need to
sequester as much water as we can on our
[SPEAKER_01]: property as it flows through the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I forget exactly the word you
used, but you suggested that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle it back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I really thought that
water, you know, essentially travels one
[SPEAKER_01]: direction through the property,
usually uphill downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to try to grab and cause as
much of that water to sit down as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: along its one way path.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but however you built your sentence,
it kind of suggested to me that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing some way to to circle the water
back onto your property a second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just kind of fish in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what what what are these
techniques that you might be talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can not only just capture the
water as it goes by, but maybe bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly it's more about capturing
it and using it as many times as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: before it would leave the property or go
somewhere like underground or we could we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't use this easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in permaculture, one of the
principles is designed from patterns to
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and permaculture's whole philosophy is
around the philosophy that nature knows
[SPEAKER_00]: best and that when we mimic these patterns
that we see in nature, we can build
[SPEAKER_00]: resilient systems that are going to stand
the test of time and function without our
[SPEAKER_00]: input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water flows downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big pattern in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is why you don't want to
put your water storage at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the water storage at the top of
your hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you want all your water
catchment at the top of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like swales, things like
hoogles, you know, a swale is essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: a long ditch on contour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs level across the landscape,
perfectly level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is going to hit that hit that in the
rainy season, hit your hill or just come
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing off a road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to flow into that swale,
which is essentially just a ditch and get
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't hit that swale, it's just
coursing down your property, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going into a ditch, probably picking up
speed, taking a lot of topsoil with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing it right down into your creek as
quick as it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do is capture that
water and slow it down so that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to sink into our into our into our water
table and recharge our stores for our
[SPEAKER_00]: wells, our groundwater stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hits that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want to have overflows at the
ends of those so that it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: overflow in and run downhill into the next
swale system or into the next set of
[SPEAKER_00]: hoogle beds that are on contour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing this, we can really slow this
water down and we can capture it as many
[SPEAKER_00]: times before it leaves the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have diverse plantings on all
those swales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, we want to stack functions
and get as many uses out of each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these swales or plantings as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, we put, you know, ideally when
we went out there, we identified here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sector that we want to generate some
privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbors drive by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dirt road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to build that swale so it
catches the water coming off coming off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to plant our privacy fence
along there and our shade fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's also heavy winds coming
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do an intense planting
that's going to break up the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to stack as many
functions as we can into that one
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to just use trees that
are just going to be blocking the wind and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to also do fruit trees so we
can get another yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can stack another function out of these
out of these these elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just going to grow a fruit
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow a vine growing up that
fruit tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fruit tree is also serving purpose as
a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just every element that we place,
we want to try to stack as many functions
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible, because this is once again
mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something I came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens when you go and walk
in in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see trees with vines growing up them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a trellis in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, how many times can we capture
that water and cycle it, cycle it,
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle it before it just sinks down into
our into our groundwater systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know that with your
expertise in permaculture design,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could actually do an entire show easily
on how to design a property, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you before you buy it or when you buy
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the nature of the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to be talking more
during the second and the third sets about
[SPEAKER_01]: wild crafting nutrition and discouraging
pests with your local plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the important thing for me
for this first section was to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of pull from you the like I
was saying earlier, your your eyes and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seeing the property and pull out
some general things that just about
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that there's a lot of
folks like me who are hearing these these
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture ideas and going, you know,
damn, I wish I would have known this
[SPEAKER_01]: before I set up everything I already have
set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because, you know, very, very it's
it's so much easier to design and build a
[SPEAKER_01]: parcel before you've moved all your crap
onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before we go to commercial,
I'd like to have you speak to this idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I don't know, either the challenges or
even the hopelessness that a farmer may
[SPEAKER_01]: have with, gosh, I've already moved on to
my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be designed an entirely
different way now that they've done some
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture education and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, gosh, they feel frustrated because,
you know, they have to plant with the
[SPEAKER_01]: property that they have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not at all how they would have
designed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're you know, when you're
talking with farmers who are feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: challenged with where they're at today
versus where they want to go, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff do you say to them to give them
heart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, certainly the last few years
around here have been really disheartening
[SPEAKER_00]: for people as they've transitioned into
the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just taken such a financial
and emotional toll and not just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, but on the whole community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, these farmers having
their farm and their homestead was a dream
[SPEAKER_00]: come true for a lot of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them work for decades to get this
and build this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and these last couple of years of
regulation have just taken the wind out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their sails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a job and a burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot more work than it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get to come out to folks
property and teach them a few new skills
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few new ways to look at their
property differently and look at their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and recognize that there are all
these resources readily available to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you, you know, once you get
somebody a little more excited about their
[SPEAKER_00]: property and, you know, the light returns
to their eyes, the little sparkle comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back and they start realizing,
oh, my God, you know, I'm spending all
[SPEAKER_00]: this money on this fertilizer and all this
money on this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, learning a few of these a
few of these techniques could really put
[SPEAKER_00]: some dollars back in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it just gets people looking at
their property with a whole new set of
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes and a whole new, you know,
a whole new enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, I'm really just happy
to see people in the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing regenerative practices,
knowing that this needs to be part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always been known for the best
cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we can prove that we're using
the cleanest and most respectful to the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet cultivation practices possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like people in this community's
product, as much as it's always been on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top shelf, are really going above and
beyond in developing these regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just really happy to see see this
Renaissance that we're witnessing right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dig a little let's let's dig one
more question into the psychological part,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a lot of folks, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, legalization has been a drag for
most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for for many of us, you know,
we're it's been a family tradition and the
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultural connections we're losing as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, there is the idea that,
OK, they are, you know, we are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: more regenerative minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are learning these new techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are learning ways that we can use local
plants and save money on inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, my gosh, it takes a lot of work to
do that from where I'm at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming that that you've got,
you know, some kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared philosophy to tell farmers about
of, you know, some some version of baby
[SPEAKER_01]: steps and small things, you know,
start with small things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you do when they feel
overwhelmed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there there is something about
regenerative that is becoming stronger in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market that people want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't really get people over
the fact that, yeah, if I do all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: other new work to make my farm more
regenerative, I can save more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, you know, marketing advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and I'm sure that there are others
like me who feel frustrated about,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I already have to take care of the
garden and the property as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make all these changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could do that as a full time job for
the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you, you know, how do you encourage
balance and to take these additional steps
[SPEAKER_01]: for farmers who, like we've already
established, are feeling pretty beat up
[SPEAKER_01]: right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I absolutely discourage people from
trying to bite off more than they can
[SPEAKER_00]: chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, compliance alone on a farm is a
full time job for a lot of these folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, farming was their full
time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they have to be the lawyer and the
consultant and the water expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go on to these licensed farms and I
teach people these practices and I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them, let's start small this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's talk about converting 10 or 15
percent of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build one hoogle and dump out one
row of these smart pots, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, yeah, building a hoogle is a lot
more work than getting a smart pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it up with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also you're going to build this
thing one time and you're building
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility that's going to, you know,
if we build it correctly, that could last
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 20 to 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grandkids could be pulling potatoes
out of that same bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ain't going to happen with your
smart pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just encourage people take it slow
because it's hard to teach an old dog new
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all did this up here for,
you know, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had really good success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But scaling up, going from a quarter acre
to an acre or going from a half acre to
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three, like a lot of people here
have done, has been a difficult process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the problems we had before,
we have them on a much larger scale now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just encourage people,
let's start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to prove it to themselves that
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want them to actually follow
the protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some traditional ways to make
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some protocols to follow that
that will, you know, give you a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see people half-assing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say, oh, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go back to the old ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it does take some effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy as just throwing some
plant in a bucket with some water,
[SPEAKER_00]: as everybody thinks it almost is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple more important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope people will learn some of the
basics of some of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: modalities before they just go all Wild
West and yeah, do something bad for their
[SPEAKER_00]: property or just waste a lot of time and
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go back to the old ways.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wasting of the time seems to be the
hardest, hardest resource to preserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so when we come back after the
commercial break, we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically about wild crafting,
uh, nutritive plants for your property so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can save money on your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guest today is regenerative
cannabis consultant, Joey Burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended cocoa substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U S at 900
[SPEAKER_01]: propagules per gram of two fungal species
selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volcani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a bio-stimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: by using the discount code shaping fire,
one word, no caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco, endomycorrhizal, inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an auto flowering cannabis
enthusiast, this event's for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Announcing the 2021 Auto Flower Cup,
August 6th, 7th, and 8th in Lillooup,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, just outside of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Presented by Camp Ruderalis, this
gathering has something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Auto Flower Cup competition,
of course, but it's so much more than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a Stunden glass hookah lounge,
a pop-up magical butter chocolate shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and waterfront marketplace with an array
of vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be an old-school auto flower
seed swap joint rolling competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cooking demos, solvent-less
squishing demos, and late-night
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary screenings of both dosed and
fantastic fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food will be lit too, including Chef
Sebastian Carossi's award-winning classics
[SPEAKER_01]: like elk chili, Kobe beef kimchi dogs,
oyster po' boys, and razor clam chowder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the campfire chili and oyster
chowder cook-off, wild oyster harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom foraging, and s'mores around the
campfires each night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each day there, Dan Jimmy of Mandalorian
will teach about auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there will be presentations on closet
cultivation and hunting for psilocybin
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The competition is open to everyone,
commercial and home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a category for photo period
plants too, so check out
[SPEAKER_01]: TheAutoFlowerCup2021.com for those
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, there will be plenty of cannabis
around, but due to state law, it won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: supplied by the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will be easy public toking,
which is why this is a strictly over 21
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can camp, rent a cabin, or stay at a
local Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glamping and RV packages are available
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to say that Shaping Fire is a
sponsor of the event, and I'll be there
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to connecting with other
auto flower fans like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get all the details at
TheAutoFlowerCup2021.com and follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram at TheAutoFlowerCup2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see you in August at Auto Flower
Cup when we bring the auto flower family
[SPEAKER_01]: together to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no doubt that auto flowering
cannabis plants have finally come into
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Night Owl Seeds works tirelessly,
bringing you auto flower genetics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable, thriving, and with extraordinary
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night Owl Seeds is an industry leader
because of the focus work of their
[SPEAKER_01]: founder, Daz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz is passionate about the cannabis plant
and pushing what auto flowers can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cultivators know that these efforts
show through in his seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Night Owl Seeds really are
extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a look at the thousands of
photos by fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proof is there and obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are complex and rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a fan of Mephisto genetics like
I am, you'll likely also love Night Owl
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night Owl founder Daz worked with Mitch
Mephisto to build the Mephisto brand for
[SPEAKER_01]: years, including breeding Mephisto's
much-loved Sour Stomper and Cosmic Queen
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing both Night Owl and Mephisto
this year because I want the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Night Owl Seeds knows how to cultivate
community too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz puts out great stickers, exclusive
packaging for limited runs, and desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really draws you in if you love
creative branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night Owl even has the Secret Owl Society
Text Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just text the word Night Owl, one word,
to 760-670-3130 for early announcements
[SPEAKER_01]: and exclusive opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you can see lots of photos and
find out about upcoming drops by following
[SPEAKER_01]: the Night Owl Seeds Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Daz.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-A-Z.NightOwl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your packs of Night Owl Seeds
at several distributors, including DC Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Exchange, Insane Seeds, and Hembrah
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Night Owl Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference because we're
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest this week is regenerative
cannabis consultant, Joey Burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the break, we were talking a lot
about how to look at your own property,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly just get folks' mental eyes into
the idea of seeing their entire property
[SPEAKER_01]: as this living, functioning, dancing
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's from our relationship with it
that we create the safety of home and the
[SPEAKER_01]: food that we eat, and hopefully the cash
crops that we offer to others so that our
[SPEAKER_01]: family can survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so often, we then buy inputs from off
the property that could be easily replaced
[SPEAKER_01]: with inputs which might actually be plants
that are causing us problems on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property, which we could actually turn
into healthy inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you talk us through the kinds
of plants that you're looking for and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to see the plants on your property that
could be used for as as nutritive inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: that could replace other stuff that we're
buying and bringing to the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bounce back one second to
something you said when we came back from
[SPEAKER_00]: the break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You introduced me and you called me
regenerative cannabis consultant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That title helps helps let people know
that I am open for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk to people for a minute
about these titles we give ourselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can get wrapped up in them and how
we can feel insecure about sharing the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I good enough to be called a
regenerative cannabis consultant and share
[SPEAKER_00]: this knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: We call ourselves a cannabis grower or a
permaculture designer or whatever these
[SPEAKER_00]: different terms are that identifies as
this singular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want people to think of themselves
as the activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a regenerative cannabis
consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an activist for regenerative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an activist for permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: An activist for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of ourselves as the
activist, we are now working for a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: power, much bigger than ourselves,
a cause much bigger than our own than the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of the activist,
you know, pass me the bullhorn,
[SPEAKER_00]: pass me that sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not taking shit from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe passionately in what I'm doing,
and I'm going to yell it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountaintops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you all will join me in thinking
of yourselves as activists for this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: activists for this planet, activists for
these regenerative practices, and not get
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped up in the, I'm a pot grower,
I'm a cannabis farmer, I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculturist, whatever it is,
you're activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see the passion in this community
and the way we've all had to fight every
[SPEAKER_00]: step of the way to get this plant and this
industry to where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fight's not over yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think of yourself as the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of yourself as the activist for all
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just want to send a lot of
love out there to everyone who's just been
[SPEAKER_00]: caring in this torch for a long time and
going to jail and fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's far from over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to put that in everyone's
head that y'all are activists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I respect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect so many of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so well said, Joey, you know,
and hearing you say it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really changes how people ground
themselves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they ground themselves as, excuse me,
as a cultivator or whatever, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: grounding themselves in how they make
money versus as an activist, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, we're identifying our,
identifying ourselves as we are defenders
[SPEAKER_01]: and growers of natural systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, you know, more amorphous than
what I sell, but it's probably way
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier overall and a much better way to
identify oneself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activists don't have time for haters or
trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we believe in this mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much bigger than us and we make no
excuses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are these plants that are on our
property that we can use in very simple
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to feed our plants and replace some
of the stuff that we normally buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I practice a few different
types of cultivation in my toolbox,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Korean natural farming techniques and
some JDOM techniques, which is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came onto a new farm here last year,
new property, and I came here in March and
[SPEAKER_00]: we start looking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that are starting to
grow early in the year like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in March and April here,
some of the first things to start vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: are the blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people here consider the
blackberry invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on just about every piece of
property in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pokey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scratchy, but it's incredible habitat
for birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides delicious berries and it's an
incredible fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fast growing green shoots in the
springtime are full of growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're full of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the very first ferments I make
in the springtime is that blackberry
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the next plants to come along are
going to be your nettles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stinging nettle and your dead nettle
seem to show up in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a big horsetail harvest over
the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to pop up in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horsetail is high in silica and good for
building cellular wall strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for treating powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make a pesticide with it that's
also good for powdery mildew prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we've got the St. John's
wort blooming which I also use to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really looking at, you know,
what's available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting in touch with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have in abundance?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have a little bit of
something, don't harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go into these areas, I want to make
sure it doesn't look like I was even in
[SPEAKER_00]: there harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never harvest more than 25% of
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm taking some materials out of the
woods like leaf mold or some leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, I bring something back into the
woods to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wood chips or some straw or some soil
or some compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to encourage people to just
go out to the woods and just start
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting and extracting these resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do it in a way that's actually
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked before about the permaculture
principle of stacking functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't just go and cut these plants
willy-nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I've got a bed in my garden
that's overgrown with blackberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, those are the blackberries I'm going
to use to make this ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a class here on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about 40 people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a little natural farming class on
our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made this blackberry ferment and I
took them over to where the blackberries
[SPEAKER_00]: were all growing into the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you walk by them, they'd reach out
and they scratch you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the branches that we made
the ferment out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stacked our functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just clearing those and cutting
them and throwing them somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: we made a ferment out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you want to avoid any
poisonous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to use blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a poison oak, better you feed that
to your goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, there are plants
all around you that you can harvest on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of the roads, in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just constantly amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just, you know, at some point
get present to where I'm standing outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and just start looking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most folks, it sounds like the first
place they should start is by making an
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go walk their property at the beginning of
April or even a little earlier if where
[SPEAKER_01]: you live the snow recedes sooner than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then make an inventory and start by
researching those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of the plants that we think
of as invasives, like the blackberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of the things that are just like,
you know, a challenging plant that takes
[SPEAKER_01]: over like the horsetail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever the plant is where you
live that is spreading so much at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the season, it is trying to
express, you know, abundant life energy
[SPEAKER_01]: for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the parts of the plant that
we use for our various concoctions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, you know, you gave us examples
based on where you live, but it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like no matter where the person lives in
the country, first things first is to make
[SPEAKER_01]: a list of all the plants that you've got
too much of in the spring so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: strategize how to turn those into
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to get to know your plant
allies in your biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would recommend people get a book on
edibles, foraging wild edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of these plants we think of
as weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds are edible certain times of the
year, or in how you prepare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also recommend people get a
book on harvesting wild medicinals,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of these same plants have
incredible medicinal and healing effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The St. John's wort we harvested over the
weekend, I use it for pesticide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also harvesting it to make
tinctures out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, get to know the plants in your
biome, in your community, in your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not have that much diversity on
your property, but I bet within a five
[SPEAKER_00]: mile radius, there are lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get out there and introduce yourself
and get to know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once we've identified these
plants that are on our property in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance, and we have, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we have identified them, and we have,
you know, we know what we want from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: these nutrients are kind of like locked in
there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there are both aerated
techniques to coax these nutrients out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are also unaerated techniques
that can coax these out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a matter of fact, the first time I
ever heard about natural farming was from
[SPEAKER_01]: a buddy of mine on the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over to his house and he had these
five, five gallon buckets, and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: all, you know, they all had subtle bubbles
covering them as they were there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hot sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just looked like sludgy to my
inexperienced eyes, you know, here 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all like, you know, like,
dude, your bubbler's broken, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, he's like, no, man,
I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just like moved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until a couple of years
later that I realized that not everything
[SPEAKER_01]: needs a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to tell you, you know,
in my head, they generally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you walk us through the different
ways in which to bring the nutrition out
[SPEAKER_01]: of these plants so that we can use them?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I prefer I tend to use anaerobic
ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your non aerated ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the microbes that are on the
leaf mold in the forest to break down my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to extract the nutrients to make
them plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do this by going into the forest
into the deep, you know, untouched areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go near the base of these big trees
often here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oaks or madrones or dug for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I peel back that top layer of leaf,
the undecomposed leaf from just the last
[SPEAKER_00]: season or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get down into that little lower
layer of leaf that's starting to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down as it as it turns into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see these white
strands of mycelium looks like spider webs
[SPEAKER_00]: racing through that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are these are large networks of
bacteria, microbes that are breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are predators that eat the
decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the soil food web is a whole
there's a whole food set.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole there's a whole food chain
taking place under that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we harness the power of these
microbes and gather them from the forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are billions of workers,
you know, and one gram of that leaf mold
[SPEAKER_00]: there between two and 10 billion microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can harness their power and we can put
them to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I when I harvest these from the
forest from my from my farm here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know these are these are microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes that are strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already thriving here at my
elevation and my exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are you know, these are the good
ones when you buy one when you buy a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of mycorrhizae from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if any of those strands are
going to survive here, but we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones we collect locally are already
they're already putting in the work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the strong microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use those microbes to break
down my plant material, meaning I put them
[SPEAKER_00]: put my plant material in a bucket with
some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw a handful of that leaf mold in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those microbes go to work over
the next couple of weeks, breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chop the plant material up into two to
four inch pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives some more entry entry
points for the microbes to go in and start
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down that plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we culture these teas, these
anaerobic teas, you know, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: aerating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not heating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microbes are surviving and thriving
at that ambient temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make them, we make a compost tea
and we aerate it and we heat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we might be building a lot of
biology, but the minute that that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature changes or those micro the
bubble stops, that biology starts starts
[SPEAKER_00]: dying off quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so compost teas are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great, but it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a you have to have to be applied at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These anaerobic, anaerobic ferments just
take a lot of the guesswork out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you dilute them at least 30 to
one, it's hard to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of broke my brain,
Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always been a big fan of aerated
teas because in my head they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh yeah, we're super charging them with
the oxygen and you know, that's so
[SPEAKER_01]: abundant of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put it on and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we take them from the bubbler
and they're not being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this highly oxygenated environment and
they're in the soil, suddenly we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these oxygenated microbes that are
in a much less oxygen environment of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just tripped on a fight that I
remember participating or watching about
[SPEAKER_01]: five years back online about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it just, I think I'm just
understanding the nature of the fight now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, so who are the guys who are,
who are these microbes that are in these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these anaerobic, you know, fermentations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will they survive more effectively than
the aerated ones once they've been applied
[SPEAKER_01]: to the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these are the tough guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the tough guys from up on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been surviving up here for eons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they weren't made in a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always think about the,
you know, use the plants that are on your
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we always, you know, through,
through natural farming, through KNF,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always talking about collecting and
incubating IMO, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the gold standard for natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming is, is collecting and incubating
more of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we know that they know how to
do the work where you live, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, I apparently am not,
have not been using the same strategy in
[SPEAKER_01]: my compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of aerated compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to say that I'm going to
stop using them, but now you've made a
[SPEAKER_01]: case for anaerobic teas, which is really
hard to argue with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it's, it's so much
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, something else we do to get the best
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I dilute that ferment into my
dilution tank, I diluted it 30 to one or
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 to one, depending on what my input is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will aerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will aerate between one to eight hours
and that will activate a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're getting the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it usually just depends on what's my
feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do I have time to aerate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I just trying to get this watered in
and bounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with eight hours of aeration,
are you suggesting that the eight hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration is not enough to degrade the
anaerobic microbes, but it also excites
[SPEAKER_01]: the aerobic microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you've got a blend of aerobic
and anaerobic, or are you saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: adding some of the oxygen actually excites
the anaerobics too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is it's going to excite
those anaerobics and bring them to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, um, so we were taking these five
gallon buckets and we're cutting our
[SPEAKER_01]: material down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we're going to add, you,
you said a handful of this forest duff
[SPEAKER_01]: material that's rich with mycelium and has
been breaking down stuff for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, since the product that we're going to
be using out of this is the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the water component, you know,
how much of it is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much of the five gallon bucket
would you fill up with, um, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: this found plant material, these,
these new shoots, these new greens,
[SPEAKER_01]: these new tops of plants and trees and how
much, you know, leaving room for water to
[SPEAKER_01]: what degree, like, do we want to fill it
all the way up with the plants or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or is that too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With, with your regular type of plant
material, I'd fill it at least halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: with plant material, full the rest of the
container up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certain plants, if I know they're
going to break down and turn into mush,
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill the container all the way up with
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first, one of the first liquid
fertilizers I make in the early spring is
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grass that I mow in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a lawn mower with a, with a bag and
I do it early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grass is all wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's covered in the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bag that up and throw it in a 50 gallon
drum, fill that thing all the way up with
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, throw it, fill it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add about a one gallon pot worth of this
leaf mold that I collected in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the first week, that grass
will be floating a little bit on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will stir it a little bit over the
first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually after about a week, it's all wet
and mushy and started to disintegrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if, yeah, if you've make a ferment
and everything's still floating,
[SPEAKER_00]: just give, just give it some good stirs
that first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're making these out of dry
materials, like we make, we get,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go to the ocean, we gather mussels
shells or oyster shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll crush those up for calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using dry powders or dry manures
to make these, you're going to want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10 parts water to one part of that dry
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got a five gallon bucket,
I'm only filling it up about a half
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm filling the rest with water
and I'm stirring that input over the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week or two, just to make sure all the dry
material is getting wet at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if this process takes, you know,
a week or so, it sounds like your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your grass experiment at the beginning of
the season, you actually even let sit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer than a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're letting this stuff sit
un-aerated for a week, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: manure example, um, but, but generally
plants too, the, it starts doing its magic
[SPEAKER_01]: and you start to see the little bubbles on
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know that like the magic is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I normally think that I don't want to
put that on my plants because the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: smells rank often, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, sometimes you'll get a plant
like a lemon balm, like it particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: smells better than most, but a lot of this
stuff does not smell like pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking a plant that is,
you know, naturally bitter in many cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you're letting it degrade and to
the point that it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving off, um, gases and then you smell
and you're like, hell no, I'm not putting
[SPEAKER_01]: this on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like I, you know,
that is, that sounds like it's an old myth
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've got in my head and I need to let
that go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, these are anaerobic ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is certainly a lot of people's
criticism of them is, ew, they're gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get them on your hands and your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no beating around that
bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most of these ferments take at least
10 to 14 days for grass or purse lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, things like, you know, those oyster
shells or, um, things like mistletoe might
[SPEAKER_00]: take three months or more to break down,
but yeah, they are stinky the whole way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I want you to think back,
think back through your ancestors to how
[SPEAKER_00]: we farmed for thousands of years,
you know, humans were largely using our
[SPEAKER_00]: own manure for, for farming practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and not that long ago in,
in, in Southeast Asia and China,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were, there was a thriving human
newer market and, and black market around
[SPEAKER_00]: manure because it was such a valuable
source in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it night water and they would
actually build a, along the rural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: back roads in China, manure, human manure
was such a valuable resource that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would build these beautiful outhouses on
the side of the road and they would paint
[SPEAKER_00]: them and decorate them elaborately to try
to get visit, uh, travelers to stop at
[SPEAKER_00]: their fancy outhouse to meet, to leave a
deposit that you could use in your fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how valuable human manure was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have, as humans, we have
completely removed ourselves from the
[SPEAKER_00]: loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to, we want, we always talk about
just closing the loop, get back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: loop guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take, you know, we take our human waste
and we put it in our clean drinking water
[SPEAKER_00]: and we turn it into a waste resource that,
you know, this world spends billions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars trying to clean and, and treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I would highly encourage everyone
to get the book called the human newer
[SPEAKER_00]: handbook and really start thinking about
how we deal with our waste streams and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we can work these waste streams back into
our, our systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, human manure composted for two
years is, is perfectly safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put my hands right in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who won an Emerald cup
with some human newer grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not want people to know that,
but it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I make, uh, I use my own urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've made a urine ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, basically you want to throw a couple
inches of leaf mold in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket and then fill that thing up over a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it took me about two weeks to fill
up a five gallon bucket and you let that
[SPEAKER_00]: sit for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you can dilute that at a
hundred to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very potent, high nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have talked about closing the
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a hundred to one that, that,
you know, you don't even have to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go half a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to last you many,
many seasons and potentially your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors too, if they're going to touch
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more than enough urine ferment to
go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's compare that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's, let's talk with the aerated
teas, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, um, even though you mostly use
on aerated teas, uh, because they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are easy and quick to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly people who are using
aerated, um, uh, compost teas and other
[SPEAKER_01]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to the example where,
you know, a farmer's got their farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have done their spring inventory of
plants and they're cutting off the green
[SPEAKER_01]: bits and they are putting those in five
gallon buckets or larger and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to let them, uh, sit for, you know,
one week to six months, uh, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, there's a, there's
probably a place on that same farm for
[SPEAKER_01]: aerated teas as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I use to decide which plant
materials I want to aerate and which ones
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I want to, not aerate?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, that's going to be up to
your context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've basically completely
eliminated compost teas, uh, aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas from any farming I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that's such heresy, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I'm hearing you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you've got to look at
where did these things come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was pushing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, around here was certainly the
grow stores pushing them as a safer
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative to your salts, but they
really, you know, they wanted to sell you
[SPEAKER_00]: these big expensive multi-thousand dollar
brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every farm I go to visit,
I see one collecting dust on the next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, farmers are only going to do
things if they're easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make farming accessible for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I really like about
natural farming, Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: and JDOM is it, it takes away the,
uh, it just makes it very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the creator of, of Korean
natural farming, um, Dr. Han Kyu,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Dr. Cho Han Kyu, he wanted to give the
power back to the farmer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical companies, the fertilizer
companies, they want, they want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: think you have to go to the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be well-educated to understand
soil science, to understand what your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, our ancestors farmed for,
you know, thousands of years without any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if, if we can just mimic, mimic how
nature farms, you ever see a compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: getting aerated in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, where would you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I don't see where it's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, in my context, these anaerobic
teas just, they make a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're stinky and gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my hands literally stink right now
because I applied some this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the life, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stinky hand life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stinky hand life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, with these different, um,
with these different inputs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot, there's a big range in how
long they will sit in the bucket,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, you've got some of these that
you said, you know, you just, just go a
[SPEAKER_01]: week and then there's some that have got
like, you know, tougher skins and they
[SPEAKER_01]: take more time to pull out like the,
um, like the horse tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for more like, like solid things,
like the, um, like the oyster shells and
[SPEAKER_01]: such, you know, you were saying six
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how does a person know how long they
should let this anaerobic tea sit before
[SPEAKER_01]: it's reached maximum quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and is there, is there ever a too
long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, let me, uh, let me make
it clear by saying these anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: ferments that I'm describing right now are
what we call JDOM liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage everyone to get the
JDOM, uh, ultra low cost organic
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, written by the son of,
of master Cho created Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: His son, Young Sang Cho, uh, wanted to
make it so Korean natural farming could be
[SPEAKER_00]: done on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, and that's how he was able to
simplify everything using this leaf mold
[SPEAKER_00]: and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so some of the, some of the things I
love about making these ferments is they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get better with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have, and you never have to
empty the container out or clean it unlike
[SPEAKER_00]: a compost tea brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's ever climbed in a compost
tea brewer knows that nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing when we're done with
this interview, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw that thing in the, put that thing on
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, uh, I lost my train of
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about, Oh, I asked you how
long do we let these, how do we know how
[SPEAKER_01]: long to let these anaerobic ferments sit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally that liquid will get dark and
I'm, and I've got ferments that are a year
[SPEAKER_00]: old right now that are black.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blackberry one I made, that liquid is
dark and they just get better with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker they get, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, soft plants like the purse lane,
the grass, even the horse tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all ready to use in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I use up all that material,
all that liquid, I never empty out the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fill it back up with more horse
tail, another handful of leaf mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: some water, throw the lid on it,
leave it in the sun right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never clean out that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things I love about
these JDOM liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so yeah, you know, you're going to
want to wait until the liquid gets really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gets dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft, soft stuff, usually two weeks,
you know, harder stuff up to three to
[SPEAKER_00]: three to six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the manures they say six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there, is there such thing as a,
as a book that suggests, um, how long to
[SPEAKER_01]: let these things sit or is it really
simply the darkness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that seems too simple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it seems like there has to be more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the big concern is that you're going
to burn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these, you always dilute them at
least 20 to 30 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what the concern is,
you know, maybe it wasn't as powerful as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you hoped it would have been,
but you're not going to burn anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the biggest concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would recommend everybody do a test
first, water, one little area,
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar, one little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start with 10% of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't hit me up later saying you
killed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up later and say you killed 10% of
your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's talk more about, um,
uh, indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, you know, for most natural
farming systems, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your local microbes that you were
suggesting earlier, like we know they can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they can handle the seasonal
dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they know how to do the work
here locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, for most of us, collecting
IMO using the Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: technique is the way that, that,
you know, is probably most popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's one of the reasons why I tell
people to use your local, uh, plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're already populated on the
outside with your local microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, do you have any other suggestions
for, for either, uh, collecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, IMO to bring it to your property or
ways to incubate them like we do in the
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO stages of Korean natural farming to,
you know, give the indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms the best step up we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Korean natural farming,
yes, you've got this IMO, indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganism process, uh, about four
different steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two IMO, eight or nine,
but the most common are five steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the first being putting cooked grains,
cooked rice in, in a cedar box or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboo basket out in the forest where
these microbes are present and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow on that rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to capture those microbes
over about a week's time, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a tricky process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably had eight or nine failures
before I started getting some good
[SPEAKER_00]: captures at my old farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a lot of wildlife and I had
issues with animals getting into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: get to eat the rice, uh, rain,
getting it rained on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally had a good capture when I put,
uh, I filled a wheelbarrow full of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold and all this basically brought the
forest to my back porch or my cabin and
[SPEAKER_00]: put the wheelbarrow right on the back
porch where I knew the animals wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put my collection box right in that
pile of leaf mold and was able to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good collection right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's, once you've got that
collection of those indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms on that rice, you mix it
equal weights, brown sugar, and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: holds it in stasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can store it long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your IMO2 collection that's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next, the next steps three
through nine are growing that on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on, um, on different types of medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use rolled oats or crimped oats and
bran and, uh, and wood chips, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% oats, 25% bran and about 50% wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make a solution using that IMO
for, you know, some gallons of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: some different inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, um, um, uh, humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, uh, we use, um, brown rice
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a little sea water, which is high
in minerals, has 93 minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you wet this, you wet those,
you wet that medium down and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: basically grow these microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll inoculate it and grow it into a
big pile over a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can double the size of that
pile by mixing it with, uh, soil from your
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take six, seven, eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO four pile and IMO five pile going
right now at different farms I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Korean natural farming, they say
that IMO process is 80% of Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most important thing to have
this biologically rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that once you get to that IMO four
process, you would basically put a light
[SPEAKER_00]: dusting of it on your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much you need to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking a quarter inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking to 16 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a light dusting is enough to
put this, you know, super powerful workers
[SPEAKER_00]: into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have biologically rich soil,
microbial rich soil, we're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use less fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There've actually run tests where they
found that these biologically rich soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you over fertilize them, that your
yields will actually go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might find that once your soil is
biologically rich, you can feed way less
[SPEAKER_00]: than you used to as well as a water less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, the creator of
JDOM, Master Cho's son, wanted to make
[SPEAKER_00]: this into an easier process that could be
done on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an input we call JMS,
JDOM microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of capturing these microbes on
some rice over a week, we can grow them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bucket of water, the microbes on a
handful of leaf mold, and we grow them on
[SPEAKER_00]: some smushed up mashed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a handful of boiled potatoes,
we mush them up into this water with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of our leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over, it can happen in two days in
really hot conditions or over a week in
[SPEAKER_00]: cold conditions, you're going to get
microbial growth in this, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to see this,
it's going to start making very tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the microbes and it's going to
turn into a foam on the top of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top of that bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that foam is at its most vigorous
peak, that's when you've got the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, you've got about a 12-hour window
to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can either dilute it and soil
drench with it or foliar feed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can jump back into that IMO
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for long-term storage, you can use
that JMS solution as the input solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: make your IMO3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could take your bran and your oats
and your wood chips, and instead of making
[SPEAKER_00]: that liquid solution with the IMO2 and all
those other inputs, you can just use your
[SPEAKER_00]: JMS to inoculate that pile and kind of
skip ahead of that IMO1 and 2 process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through this, during the second set,
we've essentially found two different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to supercharge the property without
spending money on the store bought stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one hand, we want to gather the plants
that we know already succeed on our farm
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point of being a pest, these
plants, and then also doing what we can to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture and incubate our local organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the next set, we're going to
talk about keeping things away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about pest
discouragement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really sounds like taking these two
inputs, the plants that we find on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property and the microbes we find on the
property, all we're trying to do is to
[SPEAKER_01]: care take the living things that are
property and that we find the most
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial and incubate them and help them
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes it sound a lot more
simple than most people think about
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it comes back to mimicking these
systems that we see in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes in the soil, deep layers of
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just the patterns that we've
already seen existing and thriving and why
[SPEAKER_00]: would we try to do anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I get into natural farming,
the more I find that the core of natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming is unlearning what I've already
been taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to say, I want to bounce
back to the liquid fertilizers real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that people think of their
plant as having three different stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Korean natural farming and JDOM,
we talk about the plant having three
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about its vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the high vegetative growing early
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at its transition phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when it's starting to flower or
starting to fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your flowering and
fruiting stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when it's budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fully budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got these three stages and then we
want to make these foods from plants
[SPEAKER_00]: during these stages to feed at those
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stick with that cannabis plant
because I know that's what a lot of your
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make our high nitrogen vegetative teas
for our cannabis from our vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll access plants or if you've got some
males you want to kill or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants where you need to clean out
the inside of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked before about good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cut out those inner shoots,
those little branches, those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use those green leafy shoots to make
our high nitrogen vegetative teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when that plant's going into bud and
you've got those tiny little buds on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that plant and the bottom of
those branches, clean out those little
[SPEAKER_00]: buds once again improving that airflow,
getting the plant to focus its energy on
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds that are getting hit by the sun
and going to get big and produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got a ferment that you can make
into your transition tea and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed this during transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow some auto flowers here so I always
make sure I harvest a few of those early
[SPEAKER_00]: in the year so that I'll have some
transition teas before my full terms are
[SPEAKER_00]: going into that transition time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually here in Humboldt that's around
third week of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around July 20th we'll start feeding those
transition teas and then you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower tea out of some ripe bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, I'll use some of my auto
flowers if I've got a messed up plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: two or something that doesn't look right,
I'll make my ferment out of that ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: terpy bud and feed that during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, we make these flower ferments
out of plants that are high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be your pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be your zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know those giant zucchinis you're
always sneaking in your friend's car when
[SPEAKER_00]: they come over to your house?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just giving away your fertility,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be feeding that to your ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing those plants, figuring out what
nutrients they're high in, what are their
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral makeups, and making those plants
into ferments and feeding them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at the correct time in its life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for that, Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and take our second short
break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant, Joey Burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry, and today many
cannabis cultivators are moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and chemicals to beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials, sticky cards, and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature to defend your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you manage acres of canopy or have
a simple grow tent in your home,
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert is ready to help answer your
questions and help you transition away
[SPEAKER_01]: from chemical sprays towards clean and
natural solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1967, Copert has assisted growers in

[SPEAKER_01]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to home growers, patients,
and commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb and Specta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspector and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_01]: new and interesting ways that you'll love
as a toker and a grower, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: offering you some surprises that will
delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew here on Vashon Island,
and everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family-owned in providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_01]: high-yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_01]: sifts and back-crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.

is one that delights just about
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's palate, especially when
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show Cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: II, which has a great THC high,
but looks so much like a fern that some
[SPEAKER_01]: folks can't even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_01]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes

extraordinary freak show plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaving Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is regenerative cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant, Joey Burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, during the last set, we were talking
about how to capture nutrition and
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes on our property,
incubate them, make them even more of
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, and then use them as
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, causing our plants to thrive and
saving a whole bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take that same approach and talk
about pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the sake of this conversation,
we're going to use the word pesticide for
[SPEAKER_01]: both things that may kill pests and
probably more what we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about, things that discourage pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Joey, let's start us out with the
kinds of plants we're looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the kinds of plants that we're
looking for when we're trying to wildcraft
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to guess that we're going
to be looking for whatever our local
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter and caustic plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good place to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best place to start is walking around
your yard and looking at what plants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have pests on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually going to be your aromatic
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually going to be plants that are
high in essential oils and have thick
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a rosemary or a lavender,
oregano, these different types of herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great book on JDOM pesticides,
Making Natural Pesticides, called 100
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants for Making Pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've identified over 21 of those plants
just growing on this one piece of property
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making pesticides out of many of
those, combining them and making them on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are good for soft body
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are also good for fighting
fungal diseases like powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: These JDOM herbal solutions, as they're
called, are also beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as a beneficial foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to wear protective gear
when you spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be sprayed multiple times per day
on a cool, cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray them in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you realize there are plants all
around you that can repel pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's another great tool to have in your
toolbox, but it's not the silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to just spray your way
out of all your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk again about diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go back to that word
diversity in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a monocrop, you've got
sitting ducks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, it's part of the natural system
for a plant to attract bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they help spread their seeds
and how they propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs will either carry the seed or the
bugs will attract birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come in and eat the bug and eat
the seed and they'll spread it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working against nature when we're
trying to keep pests away from our cash
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough order, as everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we mimic the systems we see in
nature, which means diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't walk in the forest and see one
plant planted in plastic grow bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see hundreds of plants growing
together, supporting each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing side by side, network of roots,
communicating with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing nutrients, warning each other of
pests or other pressures coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They communicate through these mycelium
networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've had some incredible shows
talking about this, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really enjoyed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is a diverse planting in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many different types of plants,
trees, perennials, annuals, vines,
[SPEAKER_00]: berries, as much diversity as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seven layers of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your low growing ground covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your low herbs, medium herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got big fruit trees, little fruit
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seven right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these different tools there
that are going to bring in diversity into
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants are going to be food
sources for predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants we call banker plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be food for the predator
that come in and eat your pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you release the predator bugs in your
garden because you've got an outbreak and
[SPEAKER_00]: you notice them for a day or two and then
they all disappear, well, they ate your
[SPEAKER_00]: pests and there's no other food source and
they left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can plant these other banker
plants around your garden, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have food sources for these plants,
for these predators to stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that goes hand in hand
with that are trap plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants that your pests are more
attracted to than your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to plant these around the edge of
our garden or at least eight to 10 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to draw the aphids and draw
the mites and draw the cucumber beetles
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go out in the morning and you're
doing your pest scouting, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: check all those trap plants as well as the
cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to monitor those levels and
you're going to decide where that
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold is of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cucumber beetle, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 cucumber beetles, on my Blue Hubbard
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I'm going to spray that squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spray the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis doesn't have any cucumber beetles
on it, but I'm going to spray that trap
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Hubbard squash is a great plant that
I really like to encourage people to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works as a great ground covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing a lot of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that trap plant for the cucumber
beetles and any kind of squash bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make an amazing high phosphorus
ferment out of that big old squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it to your ganja as well as feed it
to your family all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pesticides, they need to be part of
a balanced program that includes diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings of bankers, trap plants,
other pollinators, just diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a diverse system,
if one part of it fails, there's somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else there to pick up the slack and keep
it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity is strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably one of the most pleasant
solutions anybody's ever given a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all love plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all bringing home plants all the
time, probably more room than we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing we hate is pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying, hey, the solution to that
man is more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any excuse to bring home more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hit on something you said
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that we don't want to spray these
while they're sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there more to it than just we don't
want the water on the plants to burn
[SPEAKER_01]: because they act like little magnifiers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there something about the sprays
from these high oil plants that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about using as pest
discouragement?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is also not to be sprayed during a
sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with the efficacy of these
being sprayed during high humid
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Korea, at the JDOM farm, they wake up
between 430 and 530 in the morning to
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feed and to spray these pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, the plant is covered in that
solution, that pesticide as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible before it evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means your pests are coated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a better chance you're going to
have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes back to me saying, you know,
when I teach people these techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they don't follow them, they're not
going to have as good a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get some growers to wake up
between 430 and 530 in the morning to go
[SPEAKER_00]: spray their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: An outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're here in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not humid at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time it's humid here is at 430 to
530 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really care about your garden
and beating them back with these natural
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, you're going to get your butt
up early and get out there and spray
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got a cloudy day, get out there
and spray five times because you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little heat wave here a couple
weeks ago and I had a little aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three hot days up in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over 100 in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a little aphid outbreak and I
got to test out some of my pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted some Instagram videos about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the pests are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a bunch of different
tools in that toolbox, you've got a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of getting a handle on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helpful to understand that the reason
that we don't want to spray it in the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: is because the water, the solution
evaporates so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also interesting because,
you know, we've all just lived through a
[SPEAKER_01]: year of COVID stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, many of us have been
using those hand sanitizers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, you know, it's essentially
just alcohol, which is killing the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, and then a sauce that slows down
how fast it dries because we want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay moist on the hands because that means
it's active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, it sounds like we want these,
you know, we want the spray to stay as
[SPEAKER_01]: effective on the plant for as long as
possible before that it goes ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: goes ahead and evaporates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you double down on it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you said, eh, you know, on a cloudy
day, you might be able to apply it five
[SPEAKER_01]: times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you said that earlier,
I'm like, why would I want to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean this stuff doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was approaching it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm imagining you're going to
say no, it gives you if you can supply it
[SPEAKER_01]: five or six times a day, you're spraying
it, letting it evaporate, and it leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: some helpful residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you spray again, and now it's pushing
the bugs back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's essentially like you're just
hitting the bugs once verse hitting it
[SPEAKER_01]: five or six or times times a day,
and then you get the oil buildup on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know, a cloudy day gives you a lot
of opportunity to, you know, trick out
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant with all these defense
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I also mentioned earlier,
these are also beneficial foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually feeding your plant
beneficials at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spraying them five times in one day
would only be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any plants, or maybe like a
variety of plants that we don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems to be like from the last
set, you're all like, yeah, whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: got on your property, except for probably
poison oak, you know, go ahead and and do
[SPEAKER_01]: an anaerobic ferment of that stuff and put
it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as it's the new season green stuff
that's filled with growing hormones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to be dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now here in the on during third set,
you're all like, hey, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these these plants, the the
rosemary, the the, you know, oregano,
[SPEAKER_01]: garlic, things like that, put those on it
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're essentially just saying take all
your plants and put it on your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to suit them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like it might be overly
simplified, but it really does seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: our point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's somewhat simplifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I do a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't do anything willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm messing with a new plant that's
unproven to me, I test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test it on one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it I feed one plant a few times with
it before I feed anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can there's plenty of
plants that are well known in our in our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community as being beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would seek those out first before
you start, you know, messing with any
[SPEAKER_00]: unknowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my idea in approaching it like
that was just simply people who don't live
[SPEAKER_01]: on the West Coast like you and I do,
and they've got different plants than we
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it would be, you know,
do an inventory for your farm and then
[SPEAKER_01]: look them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't happen to have any plants
that are, you know, historically used as
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, well, then maybe maybe you
want to plant it, though I find it like
[SPEAKER_01]: mind boggling that anyone would have to
plant horsetail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's because I lived on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so horsetail has always been
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm on the east side of southern
Humboldt, a little farther from the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have a lot of it growing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty far inland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it growing on one dam of a gray
water pond that we have where it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: stays wet all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have it in one site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I want to encourage people get
familiar with the plants in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of what we're talking
about here is very much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not everybody has access to the to the to
land to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are in the cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are in third world
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we take a lot of this for
granted that we have that we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a little pointer on how to
make pesticide out of something that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much everybody in any third world
country will be able to get and have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can make these herbal
solutions, these pesticides out of
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have access to cigarette
butts, you can make this pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking every third world country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this this this tobacco thing is
infiltrated every corner of the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make it out of collecting those
cigarette butts, boiling them for five
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and dilute that solution 30 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a pesticide that you can use,
make anywhere in the world practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was that was my very first
introduction to anything natural in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, you know, I lived in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad had a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a little garden plot in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember my dad, I saw him pin into
a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, the hell, dad, you know,
and and and and he's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that tobacco I've been soaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I remember he bought tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the hell are you buying
tobacco for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And ends up that he was he used this
tobacco so added with the urine and then
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in a sprayer bottle and sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I, you know, I thought it was like
some kind of bizarre sorcery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't until you mention it now that
I'm like, oh, my God, all about all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way back when I was a kid, my dad was
rocking this stuff, you know, as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a total novice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but but he was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are second generation natural farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so once we've identified these
plants, we're essentially going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them the same anaerobic treatment that we
talked about in the last set.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially is that the same way
that we're going to know these?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make to make this pesticide
what we call the JDOM herbal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stupid easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to basically fill up a big
pot or you can make this in your crock
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're filling up a big pot filled
at least halfway up with plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill the rest up with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water's at least above the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go all the way to the top
because I don't want to let it boil over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you put a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to help keep all the
essential oils in it while it's while it's
[SPEAKER_00]: decocting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to bring it to a boil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's boiling, you're going
to turn it down to a simmer and let it
[SPEAKER_00]: simmer for at least five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this is done, you're going to
leave that lid on the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help it from evaporating
and it's going to keep it from from those
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be more potent if you cook it with
the with the lid on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when it's when it's ready to jar
up, you're basically going to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to use plastic plastic heat
proof bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fill them up while the
while the decoction is still hot off the
[SPEAKER_00]: stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the cap on it and turn that bottle on
its side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to help sterilize the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll know if you had a failure in
your sterilization because over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: few days, that bottle will that plastic
bottle will inflate like when you leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic water bottle in the car and it
heats up and it inflates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there was some problem with the
sterilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That batch went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those microbes are killing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw that one out and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this stuff survives, if your bottle
didn't inflate, you've got a potent jadam
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal solution there that you can dilute
30 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use it up within one to two
days of opening that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I tend to make it in smaller
containers that I know I'll use up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four ounces will make a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's your jadam herbal
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make these out of single herbs,
but lately I've been starting to combine
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made one that was pennyroyal mint,
rosemary, and oregano.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just made one that was wormwood,
St. John's wort, and the oleander.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the oleander is a plant that is
used in landscaping all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably planted all over your
nearest town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's toxic to people and animals,
but it makes a great pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the leaves, the stems,
the branches, just wear gloves because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to get that liquid on any cuts
into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very toxic, but it'll mess those
pests up bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go into that bottling step a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that I'm using rosemary and I
have broken up the rosemary and I put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in my pot and I'm leaving like an inch of
a lip so I don't boil over and I'm putting
[SPEAKER_01]: the lid on so that I'm keeping as many of
the essential turps and oils inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still probably making my house
smell hella good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when I'm done, I'm guessing that
if I want the jar, in my example,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm picturing using mason jars versus the
plastic bottles that you used in your
[SPEAKER_01]: example, but I'm assuming that I would
want to filter it to get out the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: bits and then pour it into the mason jar
while it's still hot and then put on the
[SPEAKER_01]: two piece lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it cools, it will create a vacuum
and it will suck in my loose lid so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's airtight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that that might make it
shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how I do mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I draw them up in glass jars because I
don't want to buy plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if it goes bad, that lid's gonna
pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll store for up to a year at room
temp, cool, dark room temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also keep them in the fridge,
but I just store mine at room temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using up pesticide I made last
summer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, so now that the hot stuff
is in the mason jar and it cools down and
[SPEAKER_01]: we hear that magic little dink.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the other room and we're like,
hell yeah, we win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that sound when we're cannon
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that to get to this point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we open it and we break the seal,
I believe you said that we should use it
[SPEAKER_01]: within like a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that because all of the subtlety is
oxidizing and changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the microbes are eating
themselves, that they start attacking each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's the microbes in
the outer environment that are attacking
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they teach us in JDOM is
that you've got two days to use it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I know that on my farm,
I'm usually spraying in two gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one garden, I'm spraying usually
two gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one I'm spraying two gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to make it in eight ounce
bottles or 16 ounce bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight ounce is gonna do my two
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'll open a 16 ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm gonna use the other half the next
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight ounces in the two gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like it's a lot more of a
ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we spraying these at?
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 to one is the dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray them more concentrated if
you use a foam gun like you'd use to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: your car with that has a little reservoir
to hold the soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using some kind of wetting agent
and a gun like that, you can spray them at
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to one dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these herbal solutions work better
with a wetting agent whether that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a dish soap, an ounce per
gallon of dish soap, or JDOM has a wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agent that you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little more time consumptive
input to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let's go ahead and talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy mindfully rooted down San Diego,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a bottle of JWS, JDOM Wetting
Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was grateful for it because getting
anything cool like this is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really only know one use for a
wetting agent, essentially a surfactant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which as far as I understand, I've only
ever used surfactants which are often
[SPEAKER_01]: soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have got a pest issue, I will spray
whatever solution I'm using for that mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with a little bit of soap which helps it
stick to the leaf as far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you talk a little bit about
JDOM Wetting Solution and maybe some other
[SPEAKER_01]: uses for it other than the obvious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we add a wetting agent to that
pesticide, it really helps it to stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It coats the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get caught up in these bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just really coats the plant leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives a lot more efficacy to that
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're doing 30 to one with these
pesticides, how much of the JWS do we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to add in there too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably an ounce a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they call for about an ounce a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're probably calling that JWS
because it's their own product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's traditionally the JDOM input,
we call it JDOM Wetting Agent at JWA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the JWA on its own is a very powerful
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest you try using that as a
standalone pesticide because I bet you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be surprised at the results you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend using it on its own,
but also mixing it with any JDOM herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions or other pesticides as a wetting
agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's entirely possible that he wrote JWA
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm just saying it JWS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put that on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's making these inputs and providing
them for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we understand what plants we want to
source from our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that we're going to boil
them instead of just letting them sit
[SPEAKER_01]: outside in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that we can bottle them up
to use them ourselves and to give them as
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all great as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides sprays, what other things can we
do to discourage pests on the property?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you said earlier we don't
want to use the weed whacker as much
[SPEAKER_01]: because it discourages beetles,
which are our allies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there things that we can do on our
property to discourage pests that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: physical like that that are not sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to bounce back really quick
to the pesticides and just mention one
[SPEAKER_00]: more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to make these pesticides
that's even easier and it works for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most aromatic of these herbs because
sometimes when you boil them, you'll lose
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the aromatic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants like lavender and even the
rosemary, they recommend put that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon bucket, cut it up,
fill it with water, cover it with the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: No leaf mold like when we're making the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water and plant material and let that
sit for two to four weeks and then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: your herbal solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a cold extract and same
thing diluted at 30 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are even easier ways to make
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little more time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention that before we
moved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm mentioning things before we
moved on, my buddy, Johnny, mindfully
[SPEAKER_01]: rooted, it does say JWA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one who added the S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to throw Johnny under the
bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So easy is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to the other question,
which was, are there any physical things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can do to discourage pests on the
property other than just spraying these
[SPEAKER_01]: discouragements?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things we can do that are
just going to improve plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a healthy plant,
it's not attracting pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that plant gets sick, it starts
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exuding these sugars that are going to
attract pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you've got healthy plants,
they're not sending a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come break me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the end of my life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked earlier about the wind breaks
and identifying wind sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in some windy areas up here with
a lot of these licensed cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made a lot of these farmers move
their grows away from the creeks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: riparian areas and the wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet areas along the streams, which meant a
lot of people had to get moved up onto
[SPEAKER_00]: ridge tops where there was no water,
no streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this put a lot of people in some
really windy conditions that they were not
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a plant that's just
being wind whipped all day, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not doing its normal functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a healthy plant and it is going
to be crying out for being put out of its
[SPEAKER_00]: misery, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I really encourage
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is let's how do we cut down on the wind in
your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good airflow is very different than your
grows on a ridge and it being pounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, high winds, it's bad for
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drying out your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people in plastic grow bags
and these fabric pots, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil temperatures reach up into the
hundred and forties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no biology living in your soil at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is just trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would do better around
here with a little shade in their gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: with some tree cover in their gardens or
even growing under some shade cloth to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these temperatures down a little bit
because once your plants in those temps,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I was up enjoying a tour up at
Lady Sativa over near Benbow and they find
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves on the top of a mountain ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a lot about slowing down
water leaving the property because,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, they're at the top of a
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all of their water wants to run
downhill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind is just like ruthless up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, the views are great,
but the farming can be challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes back to your context.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up on top of a windy ridge,
maybe throwing a bunch of greenhouses up
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the best move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe that you're going to lose
your covers every winter, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the best move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's make structures that are
site appropriate and cultivation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: site appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, in the site appropriate part,
and anybody who's interested in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a video I did about this on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things they do get is a lot
of hella hot sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they actually built this garden
that was all heavy rocks that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling out of the other parts of the
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made like this, you know,
more than a semicircle, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 280 degrees of a full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so during the day, they were these
these these rocks were getting really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where they were growing
their longest term sativas, so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: could, you know, kind of use it as a heat
sink, probably not a heat sink,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a heat gathering device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that these these particular sativa
plants were not being able to grow longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a really a novel use
of, you know, building your growing space
[SPEAKER_01]: for your unique parcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that comes back to that permaculture
principle of capture and store energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Rio, the owner of Lady Sativa
Farm, I've spent a lot of time up there
[SPEAKER_00]: actually did their dragonfly Earth
medicine certification for their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Rio is a longtime permaculture
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, to hear that he's got design in
there where he's capturing that heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sun that's hitting his property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just hitting the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's capturing it in those rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can release that heat at night and
on the cold days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is just, you know,
capturing a resource that's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Rio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really great tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of people just want
to show you the flowers and we're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: ooh, you know, weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I totally felt like I got a an
education in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sequestration, just hanging out with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a he's a good teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let's hit on variety before we
wrap this party up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we were talking about
the wildcrafting nutrition, you kept on
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing home the the variety of the
nutrition and the variety of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be pulling from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we want to use the
diversity on our farm to help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this also the case when it comes to
discouraging pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming we want to put as many
different types of fragrant oils on our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants as possible because there's that
many different pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the JDOM herbal solutions,
it's recommended to alternate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've seen with these pests,
you've got one product and you spray it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a round or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to hold the pests off,
but by round three, they've built up
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this here in the Emerald
Triangle for decades where spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: built up resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had the russet mites come
along and now you've got aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bugs know how to evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been around a lot just as long as
us, if not longer, and have survived
[SPEAKER_00]: through some pretty gnarly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's all about having as much
diversity on that farm as possible and to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them with as many different tools as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to make sure I always have at
least three different JDOM herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions made at all times that I can
alternate on a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spraying one in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spraying a different one in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next morning, I'm spraying that
third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm making sure that at least one of
those is also good for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, diversity, changing it up,
having lots of plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you walked in my garden right now,
you'd see a lot of areas where I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: letting all the weeds go to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm letting all the thistles go to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of stuff that most people
would have just weed whipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm letting it all go to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got tons of pollinators just
naturally doing their processes in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not dealing with any unbalanced
outbreaks because everything is just
[SPEAKER_00]: well-balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is really beautiful to see
all of these flowers that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: invasives or pests or just annoying to
people when you look at them as weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you get over that emotionally,
it's really nice to see all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even dandelions are totally beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they totally need better PR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's end the show with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that I originally
started following you, Joey, and really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed your teaching online is that I
really think that you get the heart of all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This working within the system in ways
that are beneficial to the system and to
[SPEAKER_01]: all the life forms that live in the
biological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to at least think that unless a
parcel is particularly destroyed from
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial presence or something,
I like the idea that wherever the farmer's
[SPEAKER_01]: parcel is, their unique holistic biome,
the wholeness of their biome has
[SPEAKER_01]: everything growing in it that could bring
their property back into balance and
[SPEAKER_01]: dissuade the pests from the plants that
they don't want them on to allow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on plants that they do want them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd just like to hear you speak to
that, to the idea of the wholeness of a
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer's biome to as much of that as that
you agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really just comes back to
mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we mimic what we see in nature,
we tap into that divine intelligence that
[SPEAKER_00]: has just been present for eons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we work against that,
we're swimming upstream, we're paddling
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to make your garden easier,
if you want to harness the powers of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, you've got to build these systems
that mimic those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just hope that people would
take as much interest in these other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, these other allies as we do in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that this cannabis would be
the gateway drug into getting people to
[SPEAKER_00]: care more about their food, and what
they're putting in their bodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and natural farming, permaculture,
JDOM, KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all tools that can help us get
closer to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's just been really exciting
to see this regenerative farming movement
[SPEAKER_00]: and the excitement in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me to see these old timers that
have grown the way the grow store told
[SPEAKER_00]: them for a long time to embrace this stuff
and say, oh man, this is how we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew in the 70s before there was a grow
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would gather up leaves out of the woods
and throw it, mix it into our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those old hippies knew about that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we start growing cannabis,
that the microbes came from my land and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that fed it came from my land
and the bugs that protected it came from
[SPEAKER_00]: my land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you want to talk about an
Appalachian and a product that is unique
[SPEAKER_00]: to its origination, to its source.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing more unique than that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody else that can reproduce
that product that's unique to your biome,
[SPEAKER_00]: to your property, to your farm,
to your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to encourage people to keep
exploring that relationship to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to nature, to all these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are our own little planet, our own
little universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're discovering that these microbes
are in between the spaces, in between our
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between our DNA molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are actually more made up of
microbes than we are of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as we have to take care of and
treat those microbes in the soil and feed
[SPEAKER_00]: them healthy things and not poisons,
we have to think of our bodies the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way and put healthy things into our
bodies, substances and food, nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: dense foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when these microbes are happy,
we're happy, our soil's happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these microbes are unhappy because
we're feeding them crap, we're feeding our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil crap, we're feeding our bodies crap,
our mood turns to crap, our health
[SPEAKER_00]: deteriorates, the pests and the diseases
and the parasites move in and they break
[SPEAKER_00]: it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sooner we realize we are the
same as nature, we are the same as the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and we're all one and we can start
respecting our bodies, respecting this
[SPEAKER_00]: earth equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can get in tune with nature and
be a lot happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be happier and healthier and
hopefully leave something behind for our
[SPEAKER_00]: children, grandchildren and seven
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a beautiful place for them to
live and carry this on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hear, hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Joey, thank you so much for sharing
your heart and your passion and your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clearly had my mind blown a few times
today and I've gotten new paths that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take and I'm sure that I am not
the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to chatting with you
again when I'm down your way next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to follow more and hear
more from Joey Berger, the best way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that's easy, is you can go on
Instagram and follow Joey at
[SPEAKER_01]: TheHumbledLocal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, it is a especially
good Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does he share with you pictures
of plants, which we all love, but he's
[SPEAKER_01]: very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: as teaching through his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like being a part of a slow
burn class or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I very much like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Joey at TheHumbledLocal on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second thing is the books that Joey
mentioned, the Judom books, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: links to those books on the Shaping Fire
website on the page for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get easy links for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to plug episode Shaping Fire
episode 63 with Suzanne the Bug Lady that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did entirely about trap and banker
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were intrigued by the trap and
banker plants ideas that Joey was
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching, you can hear a whole hour and 20
minutes of that from Suzanne.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also if you're in the California
area or if you are open to a road trip or
[SPEAKER_01]: a flight, I really encourage you to attend
one of Joey's classes that he hosts there
[SPEAKER_01]: at Heartwood Hub, the property that he was
talking about in most of his examples
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a permaculture demonstration property
that he lives on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also doing classes there again
now that COVID is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first of their classes was last
weekend was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those things and more you can
find links to on the shapingfire.com
