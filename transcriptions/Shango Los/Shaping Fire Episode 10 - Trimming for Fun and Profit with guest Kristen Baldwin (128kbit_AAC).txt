[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming is a constant companion of the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the earliest days of commercial
cannabis, growers have been trimming their
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis flowers to increase their bag
appeal and clean up the flavor profile
[SPEAKER_03]: from being overly green tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming styles change depending on where
you live and what your final use of the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing for sure though, trimming is
very time intensive and it's hard on your
[SPEAKER_03]: hands and usually your back and butt too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is true though that it is a necessary
step in producing fine cannabis and both
[SPEAKER_03]: home growers and commercial growers need
to get the job done one way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to the Shaping Fire
podcast and I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guest today is Kristin Baldwin,
Director of Operations of Green Mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a mobile trimming company that
sends out teams of between one and 15 or
[SPEAKER_03]: so people to trim home grows and large
scale commercial grows too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we'll talk about the different
styles of trimming, their favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: scissors to use, and get a better
understanding of their business plan and
[SPEAKER_03]: how they make money in this area that many
in cannabis consider a difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, Kristin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Shango, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So glad you could make the time to join
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the cannabis market is
exploding, of course, as licensees and
[SPEAKER_03]: patients and even just everyday citizens
are beginning to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the kinds of clients that you
find calling you for trimming services?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see clients all the way from large
scale commercial growers who have several
[SPEAKER_02]: locations in which we trim with teams of,
you know, 15 to 20 trimmers several days a
[SPEAKER_02]: week to personal growers in their homes
who have just a few plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really it's a huge range.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably, you know, it probably feels
like two different departments because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the demands of your big commercial
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The expediency and the regularity and how
after once the contract is set up,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of plug and play versus your,
you know, your personal trimming services
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, you might just be at
somebody's house for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you kind of have to create that
relationship anew with that person way
[SPEAKER_03]: differently than the commercial clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, to that effect,
we make sure that the people we send to
[SPEAKER_02]: our personal grow clients are our
supervisors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're our best trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're our fastest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they're in a position to sort of
educate in the home as the client wants us
[SPEAKER_02]: to, or doesn't want us to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may want to sit with the trimmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to them how involved in the
process they are and how closely they work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine that there's a lot more
customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's probably really weird too,
to be in some people's homes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, that's awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awfully intimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're growing, maybe sometimes
they're a little sketchy about having
[SPEAKER_03]: people in their homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then heck, you know, if they're
patients, some patients are, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're living in some rough situations
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine that's a very colorful
environment for your team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we find is that it's really
just great people who generally are either
[SPEAKER_02]: caregivers for them, for their own needs
or caregivers for a friend or family or
[SPEAKER_02]: group of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, they're genuine, kind
individuals who just really need a
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, especially with the older
folks, it's just that they're not able to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with some folks it's that
they're new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks are just not able to physically
take care of the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's sometimes that we go do
harvesting and gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can move clones around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, you know, a fit to your need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if, if, if you were in my state,
I think I would just call because my time
[SPEAKER_03]: is better spent, you know, recording a
podcast or calling an advertiser instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of spending my time trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that, you know,
it makes, I would expect that you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people who certainly can,
but it's just not how they prefer to spend
[SPEAKER_03]: their time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and also, I mean, that's even true in
the commercial spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they couldn't hire and
manage that staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that they prefer not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that they have enough on their hands
just managing growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a completely different skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just because you know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean you know how to manicure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and interestingly, we find some of
the best trimmers come from industries
[SPEAKER_02]: like cosmetology school graduates,
for example, make excellent marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmers as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, they're the fastest that
we've seen and the most deft with the
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller, smaller work, which, you know,
some of it can be quite meticulous.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you charge by weight or time?
[SPEAKER_02]: We charge per person per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on the size of the team that we
send you and the number of supervisors
[SPEAKER_02]: versus trimmers, that calculates an hourly
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't charge any administrative fees or
anything weird on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, on a daily basis,
that gets observed by the grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether that's a personal grower or a huge
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see the same tablet that says,
this is how long we were here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how much it costs you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try and keep it as, you know,
transparent and without much room for
[SPEAKER_02]: error.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that doing it by weight,
it just kind of lends it to a,
[SPEAKER_02]: to a lot of variance and, and ways that
things can go askew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, and then you have to change
the price for dry or wet and how dry is
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that'd be a lot of malarkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure that I'm not the only one
listening to you who's curious about a
[SPEAKER_03]: ballpark figure for what this would cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also figure that you probably got a
wide range of pricing from like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, your bulk commercial clients to
somebody, you know, who's a personal
[SPEAKER_03]: grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say that somebody has just got,
you know, your simple legal six person
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and they've got, you know,
very, you know, moderately sized plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say everything's like a medium,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would I expect it to cost to have
one or two of your people come and trim
[SPEAKER_03]: out my, my six plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that it would really be
just a few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be a day of work for one
or two people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if it's six really,
really productive plants, like a big,
[SPEAKER_02]: big fat indica versus a sativa that's
going to have a lot fewer smaller buds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are further apart, that would make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many hours it would take,
but generally we wouldn't book more than a
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our personal grow clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really seen it go over more
than two days unless the objective is for
[SPEAKER_02]: us to come and cut the plants down on one
day and do the harvesting and defanning
[SPEAKER_02]: and then let it dry and come back and do
the trimming on another day, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quite often how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be two days, but it might only
be four to six hours of work on each day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to, and for me to think, okay,
my, my six plants go from being cut and
[SPEAKER_03]: hung, which I would do to being,
you know, nice and in jars done for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like in, you know, I'd be like,
yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a lot of variety in
trimming styles, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, if you're, if you're
trimming for bag appeal, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot tighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, where I live in,
uh, out here on Vashon Island,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, people leave their flowers
really shaggy because they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at all those trichomes on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'd rather have those on my
flower than, you know, in the trim,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, which, you know, you normally go
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what sort of client intake do you
perform to make sure that your team is
[SPEAKER_03]: providing trimming that matches the
client's expectations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so every time we get a new client,
there's an intake they go through that
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of talks about, do you trim your
stuff wet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you trim dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or is this just us prepping a large
amount of cannabis to go into a trim
[SPEAKER_02]: machine, which is one job, you know,
that we do for really, really big clients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is this, are you going to make,
uh, some sort of extract out of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you extracting in some way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you making hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's the end game sort
of can dictate the trim in some cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the way down to, I want a
loose, leafy trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe for something like a caviar roll
where you want to take all your excess
[SPEAKER_02]: Keith and reroll those buds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, the leaves are something for it to
stick to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have some clients who are
absolutely, you know, because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: medical clients are on a such a tight
budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make sure there's not even
any little tiny crow's feet or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: left on the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's extra STEM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's a lot of time what the client
is looking for, you know, the end user.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the kind of intermediary, our big deal
is you, we will do it exactly how you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why we have the supervisors there who can
interface directly with the client and get
[SPEAKER_02]: really specific information on what the
team is supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also over time, you know,
because a lot of places we go back over
[SPEAKER_02]: and over, um, they'll develop a rapport
and then it becomes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost fluid as a new member of the team
comes on to really get them up to speed on
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular style for that place
fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's dive in the, um, one aspect
of that a little more specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so let's say that you've got three
clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: One's going to make everything into bag
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one person is going to process it,
uh, you know, in a, in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a BHO tower or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third person is going to,
you know, just, just roll it up and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so how would you trim differently for
those three clients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for someone who's making, you know,
it's doing a BHO extract that may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: they may be wanting, uh, a very heavy trim
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be all they're using to make
their BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be then separating out the bud or
they may be doing what's called a nug run,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be that extraction using the
buds as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the point of
clarification there would obviously be are
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you know, is your main product goal
for the, for the hash going to be the trim
[SPEAKER_02]: or the trim plus the bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what do you, you know, which thing do
you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then if they really want the
everything together, the Phoenix tiers,
[SPEAKER_02]: then, um, then it would just be shucking,
essentially getting it off of the stem and
[SPEAKER_02]: ready for, you know, processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would probably happen wet and,
and you wouldn't do much more to it after
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for somebody who's going to,
you know, smoke the buds themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: then typically we would do something more
of a defan, uh, first in the harvest flip,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, and then trim it down dry
because you can get a much finer trim on a
[SPEAKER_02]: dry product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think, you know, it's,
it's a more time consuming manicure,
[SPEAKER_02]: but ultimately you're getting a lot more,
um, flavor than, than it's solely from the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're, you'll lose that kind of hay,
um, taste or smell a lot more quickly if
[SPEAKER_02]: you trim it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the first time I was involved
with a grow for a, a large CO2 run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the first time I had done
shucking, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, up to that point,
I had always just trimmed for personal
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but then, you know, I'm, I was
watching, I was being mentored and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: learning how to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and I saw these folks just like,
you know, shook it right off, off the
[SPEAKER_03]: branch and it drops into the bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no effing way, you know,
you're all like, you're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere in between, um, is, is that
disrespectful to the flower to,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh my God, this is going to be the easiest
trim ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're never really sure which thing
is true when you're doing that process,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you're working for somebody
else, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I mean, it's a big
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get, take somebody's hard work over
several weeks and, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: take it from that state to usable end
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the intermediary that
the trimmer performs in a lot of cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if it's not going through an
extraction process, you know, if,
[SPEAKER_02]: if, if the trimmer mangles the buds,
they mangle the buds and that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're squashed, they're squashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you can suddenly,
you know, replace them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no like little like bike tire
pump that you can stick back into it and
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like, oops, you know, once you've
squished it, it's, it's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think that that's why it's such
an intense process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, these guys are working in,
um, under extreme scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing to keep in mind
on the commercial level is that we'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: a team of 10 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have, you know, three or four
cameras on them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times, uh, everything has to be
meticulously weighed and accounted for
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the systems here that are
extremely rigorous in managing this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: market, both on the medical and retail
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's, it's a lot of
responsibility and we don't take that
[SPEAKER_02]: lightly, nor does anyone really in the
whole chain of process that's involved
[SPEAKER_02]: with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a commercial level and you have to
take it really seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take our first short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my guest today is Kristen Baldwin of
green mountain harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like podcasts like shaping fire,
chances are that you will like audio books
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much audio books are like podcasts
except with less stuttering, better
[SPEAKER_03]: production quality and more targeted
topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make audio books sound better than a
podcast and you know, maybe they are,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like podcasts too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to learn from people talking to me
while I'm doing something else like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, driving or cleaning my house or
making dinner or even being at work,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing audible.com has an offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell you about right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are offering a trial of their audio
book service for absolutely free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to shaping fire.com for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will get a free audio book
straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to it on your mobile
device, on your computer, or you can
[SPEAKER_03]: download it and listen to it, you know,
pretty much anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course they really want you
to subscribe to their service forever and
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy more and more audio books.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as cannabis users, you also know how
this goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is free.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad that, but it's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I listened recently to smooth
smoke signals by Martin Lee from project
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.org Martin's book is a classic of
cannabis advocacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He explains the history of cannabis in
America, uh, THC and CBD cannabis science
[SPEAKER_03]: and why cannabis policy in America has
gotten so jacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you consider yourself a
cannabis person, this book really is a
[SPEAKER_03]: must talking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all sound radical just cause we're
talking about weed, but if you learn the
[SPEAKER_03]: history and science of cannabis,
suddenly you become smart and trustworthy
[SPEAKER_03]: to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book was really incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no doubt that Martin Lee is
the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the book for free just for
doing the trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you don't want to listen to a
cannabis book, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's sci-fi and history, biography.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, you can even listen to a book about
card counting in blackjack, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first book is free.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do do a pretty good job making me
want to stay every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to shapingfire.com forward slash
audible to find out more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host Shango Los and our guest
this week is Kristen Baldwin, director of
[SPEAKER_03]: operations at green mountain harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the first set, we talked a lot about
kind of the idea of, of the trimming
[SPEAKER_03]: business and the kinds of people who hire
you and, and actually how damn necessary
[SPEAKER_03]: it is in the new legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's funny because, you know,
a lot of people have trimmed before and so
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people have got their preferred
method and their preferred scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm like totally curious,
you know, in online grower forms,
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems like everybody has their own
favorite scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself like small spring loaded scissors
with a curved tips, you know, so I can
[SPEAKER_03]: like get on in there in the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my growing mentor, he prefers tiny
scissors without a spring, but with really
[SPEAKER_03]: big hand openings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that, that your team,
like everybody likes their own style or is
[SPEAKER_03]: there a particular style that seems to
really come out as being, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: universally best by professionals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, I think in the early days of green
mountain harvest, so that was like six
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, they did experiment with
several different styles of shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've settled on and really we
provide all of the tools through a
[SPEAKER_02]: supervisor kit that they carry in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the hydro farm curved blade
shearer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we chose that one because for a few
reasons, one, it's super affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think it's a really good price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The curved blade, kind of like you said,
is really what we think creates the
[SPEAKER_02]: tightest trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it's the easiest on your wrist,
we find, because you're not curving your
[SPEAKER_02]: hand as often.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blade is curved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a straighter arm and allow
the curve of the blade and then the twist
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant rather than arcing your,
your wrist at a funny angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that, that makes me think
about OSHA standards and just general
[SPEAKER_03]: worker health.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're in this odd position
because your company has the state level,
[SPEAKER_03]: but obviously cannabis is still illegal
federally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what kind of best practices have
you put together for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: creating an environment that is,
you know, ergonomically healthy for your
[SPEAKER_03]: trimmers, even though they've spent their
entire day using their hands and probably
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting down, which is probably two of the
worst things that you could be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, you know, we really,
really made a point of keeping safety as a
[SPEAKER_02]: main priority for our team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to that effect, you know,
we at, when they are hired, they're given
[SPEAKER_02]: a set of exercises for their wrists and
their backs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a system in place where our
trimmers can sit or stand and they can go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless there's some really heavy space
constraints that would disallow somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: from being able to get up and,
and, and choose to sit or stand,
[SPEAKER_02]: we encourage people to really take both of
those options.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, surprisingly though
OSHA is a federal organization,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have been great working with me
directly over my years in this industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: regardless of the context and really,
you know, come and educated us and had
[SPEAKER_02]: open dialogue with, with the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're in a funny place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, our main goal is to create
an environment for our trimmers that's
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that also involves not just an
ergonomic situation, but some other things
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that effect, it, it, it,
we have some, some other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: masks, if there's any kind of mold or
mildew present, we use a food grade brown
[SPEAKER_02]: butcher paper on the tables so that each
environment is sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our, our trimmers all use a new set of
gloves after each break.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are able to have, you know,
left the building and come back in clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know, do you have a daily team
that's pretty much full time or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much all part timers who are on
call?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of our people are part time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are employees with us, which allows
them to be covered under our workman's
[SPEAKER_02]: comp, which is a huge key in this
industry, really trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put as many of those standards of,
of normal working conditions in place for
[SPEAKER_02]: people, even though again, we're in that
funny gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally the trimmers work between 25
and 35 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, December is certainly slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We joke that we think that the trimmers
get less work because the growers plan not
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to harvest right around Christmas
because why would they want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can plan for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I'm looking at our January
schedule and it's, it's totally insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone who didn't harvest in
December is harvesting in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also sort of lovingly call
October Hemptober here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: because all the big outdoor farms,
that's a big, big time for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can be really fun and exciting
little trips for the trimmers out to these
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool outdoor big, big, you know,
really, really nice farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the funny things about
outdoor, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, the idea of harvest I
mean, obviously there's lots of indoor in
[SPEAKER_03]: the country and, and there's certainly way
more harvesting taking place as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: around the calendar, but in volume,
you know, harvest suddenly you're needed
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have, you know, a seasonal spike
where you need to over hire just for
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest season and then you get back down
to a more basic crew for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: year?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, we actually don't follow
that kind of hiring practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're an employee with us,
you're an employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do our best to provide you hours
consistently, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for us, it really is a balance of,
of demanding excellence from our team so
[SPEAKER_02]: that the people that do stay with us are
the best ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then making sure that those
people can have work and, and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: delicate balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I do handle a lot of the
hiring and firing and all the stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do find that, you know, I do want to
be able to provide work for people
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately when I hire them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have to caution them that this is
a business where there are lulls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we give our, our employees the
opportunity to sort of create their own
[SPEAKER_02]: schedules in the sense that they're,
they have some, some big flexibility
[SPEAKER_02]: there, which to that effect, if they need
to have another part-time job to
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement this, we understand that that's
part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on that note, is it hard to find
skilled trimmers, you know, to fill all
[SPEAKER_03]: the ranks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because so many people say they've got
experience and then like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe they're too slow or distracted or
sloppy or drunk or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those things have happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's part of why we have
this supervisor in the field for each
[SPEAKER_02]: group of 12 trimmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows us to sort of, regardless of
what your resume says, really watch what
[SPEAKER_02]: you do in that first 30 day probation
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if, if we can't get you up to
speed in that first 30 days, then,
[SPEAKER_02]: then typically that'll be it for people
who just can't cut the mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and sometimes, you know, the other,
the other side of the equation is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: People find out that they really can't or
don't enjoy the repetitive nature of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so we do have people who will do
it for a couple of weeks and then say,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I don't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people that want to put their
headphones on and, you know, listen to an
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome podcast like this one and,
and, and trim some plants and be with some
[SPEAKER_02]: great people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other cool thing is that we can hire
people with some disabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty neat because,
you know, it's like, you have a walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, if you can get into the facility
and we'll make sure you can, then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: sit down and trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good for people who are
retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of folks that just trim with
us one or two days a week, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and have their own grows and,
and, and just love it and have been with
[SPEAKER_02]: us for years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other people who are, you know,
fast, young people directly from the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry in the last few years who just
are amazing and, and, and, and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, so, so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's the other side of the
workforce is people who've just been
[SPEAKER_02]: trained commercially in the last few
years, but we don't hire anyone directly
[SPEAKER_02]: who doesn't have some sort of trimming
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have any trimming experience,
then we have a trimmer training school
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of program you can, can choose to go
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've, I've met some folks who
are on the autistic spectrum and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing how appropriate trimming is for a
lot of the folks who have got the hyper
[SPEAKER_03]: focused ability and they can work for long
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just like, you know, you, you allow
them to wear their headphones and let them
[SPEAKER_03]: know what you need done and boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, damn, it was done fast
and efficiently and in good sheer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing the kinds of people,
you know, who are able to work in our
[SPEAKER_03]: industry who have not necessarily had the
opportunity before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can, can folks get high on the job?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's really strict regulations in
place around use anywhere within the
[SPEAKER_02]: within 500 feet of a commercial facility,
whether it's a grow or a store or an
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction facility, you can't use the
product or even bring personal product
[SPEAKER_02]: into that facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically when you go into a
dispensary, you're not supposed to even
[SPEAKER_02]: have any cannabis already on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And technically if they see that they have
to ask you to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and if one of our trimmers is
observed, using cannabis within 500 feet
[SPEAKER_02]: of a facility, we have to fire them that
day because they can lose their light,
[SPEAKER_02]: their badge, essentially to work in the
industry for just that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine that for a lot of trimmers,
that's a, that's a deal breaker right
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, listen, if I'm going to be trimming
30 hours a week, I want to be high for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, no good, no good for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, what you do at home is
your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time of day you do that is also your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you do when you leave the facility is
your business, but what you do while you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be at the facility, that's the
key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, on a 15 minute break where
you're not allowed to leave, you can go
[SPEAKER_02]: outside and stretch, but you know,
it's 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't leave the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that, you know, I feel like
there's ways that people could probably
[SPEAKER_02]: get around that if their dosage requires
like a morning use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could maybe supplement with an edible
or something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no one is suggesting that
especially for a medical patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't do what they need to do,
but you can't be using the product on the
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, true just across the
board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think that that's the one,
one of the big differences between,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what, what people think we do in
this industry and what we do is that there
[SPEAKER_02]: really isn't a lot of use in, in the
actual manifestation of the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of a completely separate thing
at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the more, the more commercial
and commodity based it becomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to continue in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when everybody was working in
medical and it was much less regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and loose, you know,
everybody would get high at the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, just about every business
meeting and, and because that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture was, you know,
I, I found that frustrating a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause even though I got to try some
amazing, you know, flowers and oils from
[SPEAKER_03]: that people would bring to the meetings at
the same time, so many of the folks would
[SPEAKER_03]: not remember the key points of the meeting
or what they, or what they committed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would have to send follow-up
emails to remind them what they agreed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though, even though I enjoy the
social aspects of it, I do see as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as cannabis businesses are getting more
serious, the less people who are doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sort of like, you know,
I guess the three martini lunch would be
[SPEAKER_02]: the closest equation, you know,
and, and even if you're in the beer
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, you're not testing beers at nine
AM every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like in any industry where
there's this quality to it, where there's
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of, you know, state of
alteration that's going to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, in this industry,
the reality is you're trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigate that weird gray area,
that weird federal state gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think this is one of the ways
that they've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other side of it is exactly
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professionally at 10 AM, you know,
would it be appropriate to pop a bottle of
[SPEAKER_02]: wine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on a special day, but probably not,
you know, probably not if you want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what people need to do to take care of
themselves medically again, is another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, but I would say recreational use in
a meeting is really bad, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could have 10 different people
who respond to that particular strain
[SPEAKER_02]: super differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be one that's really like,
makes you really focused, but it may not
[SPEAKER_02]: work that way for this whole group of
people that, you know, now you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: make decisions with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take another short break
and be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Kristen Baldwin of Green
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountain Harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Businesses everywhere are constantly
striving to reach out to people through
[SPEAKER_03]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know though, that trying to reach a
cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_03]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_03]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_03]: others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into a relationship with their
[SPEAKER_03]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will explain your service or product
and what sets it apart as desirable and
[SPEAKER_03]: help our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_03]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the podcast is young but growing
at an exceptionally fast rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you become an advertiser on the Shaping
Fire podcast now, you are going to pay a
[SPEAKER_03]: fraction of the cost we'll be asking for
in just a few months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet everyone listening both now and to
the back catalog of interviews later will
[SPEAKER_03]: hear about your company again and again
for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great deal for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay a small amount now because the show is
new, but take advantage of the huge
[SPEAKER_03]: listening audience we will have forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do yourself a solid and contact us today
for rates on podcast and newsletter
[SPEAKER_03]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Email hotspot at shapingfire.com to find
out more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Shango Losan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our guest this week is Kristin Baldwin,
Director of Operations at Green Mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before the break, we were talking about
a lot of the specifics on not only running
[SPEAKER_03]: a business but working the best possible
customer service with either the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial growers or with personal
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during the break, I was thinking about
it and it made me wonder about employee
[SPEAKER_03]: theft because in a big commercial
environment, maybe you can do something on
[SPEAKER_03]: the slide that the cameras don't see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in a real informal situation
in somebody's home, I can imagine being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to abscond with some there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your experience with employee
theft?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that much of an issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we really, really, really just
sort of impale with every ounce of our
[SPEAKER_02]: strength into our employees how dumb it
would be to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't typically have a lot of
problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, people try all kinds of
crazy things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was an incident in one of the
very first dispensaries that I worked in
[SPEAKER_02]: where the employee, he was on their trim
team and what he would do would be to put
[SPEAKER_02]: several gloves over his gloves and then he
would successively put a butt in each
[SPEAKER_02]: glove and stick it in his pocket as he was
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that he really
understood that his Adidas running pants
[SPEAKER_02]: were very much showing the outline of
these, what looked like golf balls in his
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I noticed this and I couldn't
figure out what was going on because he
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely didn't have golf balls in his
pocket when he came to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one of those situations where
I think it seemed like a good plan at the
[SPEAKER_02]: outset, but in execution, particularly
with the number of cameras that he was
[SPEAKER_02]: visible on, it just did not go well for
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can imagine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I find is there's so much
cannabis just around in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a really dumb play to steal
from work.
It's a dumb play.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got it in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would you then go and risk your job
to steal it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at the beginning, there was a whole
point of contention around, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you do with the little buds that
fall on the floor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, it's floor weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just kind of like in the early days,
that was just sort of going out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was floor weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even that in the long term had to be
accounted for and there had to be
[SPEAKER_02]: standards of operation put in place to
say, no, you have to actually take that
[SPEAKER_02]: back and weigh it and say, this is how
much we wasted and account for it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just sweep it up and stick it in
a jar and take it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's flip that dynamic around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of the trimmer stealing,
let's talk about arbitrage.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you get somebody who's got a
personal grow and in lieu of paying you
[SPEAKER_03]: for some or all of it, they want to give
you their trim for you to then resell to a
[SPEAKER_03]: BHO person or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A, is that legal?
[SPEAKER_03]: B, is that something that you ever come
across?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, that's not legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only intermediary we would be in that
process would be if we're brought in to
[SPEAKER_02]: trim and then they're separating those
things out and they send it with a
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed courier from their operation or
another to take that to an operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have the product at any point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nature of the difference in our
licensing doesn't allow us to have it,
[SPEAKER_02]: to move it, to grow it, to sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that requires a much different
license than what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an ancillary vendor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't play middleman on the deals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff is RFID tagged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially we don't own or move any
RFID tagged product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about licenses in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So up to this point, we've been talking
about either having a license to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis business or an individual person
having their badge, which allows them to
[SPEAKER_03]: work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have not come across actually,
I mean, you're the only one actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're the first trim company that I've
come across, which is why I was so curious
[SPEAKER_03]: to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been all over the country talking
to people at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that the days of trimming
businesses have now arrived and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be having a lot more competition
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you looking to other states to
license your intellectual property?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a franchise, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we all understand that franchising
isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you looking to expand the Green
Mountain Harvest name into other states?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have business opportunities now
available in any state where it's medical
[SPEAKER_02]: or retail or somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are available to create business
opportunities for, you know, people who
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do this there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the owner, Susan Joukowsky,
started this six years ago, she really saw
[SPEAKER_02]: a need for this industry and no one else
was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had to go to the state and say,
this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, wow, that's a really good
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hadn't even thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that hadn't even crossed
anybody's mind that this was a really
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable and necessary piece of the puzzle
to make all this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have lots of different services
available to that end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes just go and we'll train teams
of trimmers for people that already have
[SPEAKER_02]: an existing operation and want to have an
on-site team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've sent people to other states and
we'll send, you know, again, some of our
[SPEAKER_02]: supervisors and Susan, the owner,
will go and they stay for a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few days or a week or two and they get
everybody up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one option.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other option is to actually,
you know, become a partner, a Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Harvest partner and carry that
name into another state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, then, you know,
you get a huge amount of our intellectual
[SPEAKER_02]: property and our standard practices and
how we operate in that gray area
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully, which is kind of part of the
key for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's circle back to you mentioning Susan
going to the state to try to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: blessing for this kind of a business model
because that is a really important
[SPEAKER_03]: entrepreneurial point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are like, oh,
now that cannabis is legal, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to start a business and I don't have to be
an activist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that all entrepreneurs in
cannabis have to remain activists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not only to make sure that your
local government doesn't pass some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: moratorium that's going to suddenly tie
your hands, but what Susan did,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Susan had to come up not only
with the business idea, but then she had
[SPEAKER_03]: to lobby for it with regulators so that
there was a license allowance for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a, you know,
that's extra credit to Susan for stepping
[SPEAKER_03]: up and following that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a good lesson for
everybody that, you know, you might have a
[SPEAKER_03]: groundbreaking idea and you're going to
have to sell it to your regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it's all about being part of
the movement overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you may have a great idea and you
may be really scared about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of a gray market or a black
market with that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unless you stand up and unless you
become part of the movement and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what I'm doing and this is why
it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, you don't move us all
forward as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what she did was say,
not only do I want to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: provide a safe way to handle the product
for this particular point in its process,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also what does a business model look
like that really supports its employees as
[SPEAKER_02]: if this were any other industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have workman's comp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to make people employees and not
have them work as contract labor,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is so often what people are more apt
to do because it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the employer, but it provides the
employee no protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not an employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just they're not they have no
protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Susan really did say, I want to do
this, but I want to do this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does this look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And got amazing certifications put in in
place for our company that sort of say we
[SPEAKER_02]: are the most compliant and this is how
that looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that's why I was excited to come
and work with her after years of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: other things in the industry, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I think that it really helps the
industry as a whole when people like Susan
[SPEAKER_03]: provide that leadership, because then the
regulators can point and say, look,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a good actor who's doing it the
right way, who is doing the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: that cause us to feel more safe as
regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, hopefully,
eventually some of those regulations can
[SPEAKER_03]: be a little loosened so that they don't
cost as much for companies to comply.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, you know, we've got this
strange dance between entrepreneurs and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators of, you know, what can the
entrepreneurs get away with versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators wanting to, you know,
regulate and or ban everything because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're afraid of risk.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's and and that's why people have
to be really vocal and they have to get
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, even to the point of.
[SPEAKER_02]: For children who are using cannabis
patches in schools, that was a big,
[SPEAKER_02]: big hurdle that we had to overcome here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping people understand that this is a
medicine and that these kids are using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not getting high at school.
[SPEAKER_02]: A kid in a wheelchair who's can move their
arms solely because they've started using
[SPEAKER_02]: these patches isn't getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having a better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so even something as, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple as that takes a huge group of
people and a lot of effort and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people coming forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, what I would say to anyone
in those states that where it's still kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of gray is don't don't stay in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get out there and be vocal and and
get and get ready to sort of be part of
[SPEAKER_02]: something special because, you know,
the amazing other side of this is that
[SPEAKER_02]: after you've been in a state where it's
gone recreational and you've supported the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical market and you've seen you know
what's happened here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the outcomes with people getting
out of jail and all the cool stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens on the side with the medical
research and the kids getting better and
[SPEAKER_02]: the seizures going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's just it's worth coming out of
the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like Susan is going to
Pennsylvania, for example, where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to speak at a conference that's
all just for doctors who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just just getting the doctors on board is
crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's there's work to be
done in every state and and and and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: say is just be brave and go do it.
