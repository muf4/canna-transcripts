[SPEAKER_00]: So Daniel, thanks so much for taking a
little second to talk with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you and I started talking about
cannabis equity and I realized that I
[SPEAKER_00]: hardly know anything about cannabis equity
and I figure lots of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with normalization, so many people are
focused on the strains and the new
[SPEAKER_00]: products and the different states that are
legalizing that sometimes we forget that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis equity is happening and I figure
that this would be a good time for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you would explain it to me and other folks
what you're doing in San Jose and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole idea of cannabis equity even is.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis equity provides a real
mechanism for the small business owner,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue collar man so to speak,
to participate in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've seen in California, it's a big
money game.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a capitalist society and it's
aggressive and it's bringing out the most
[SPEAKER_01]: adept and the most skillful investors that
know how to do this because they've done
[SPEAKER_01]: it in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't compete with that and part of
what I've been saying is culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I'm kind of straying from
the fact, I'll get back to culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what equity is, it pretty much
provides a way for an equity applicant to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply and to have the resources made
available, but we're doing different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's public incubation versus private
funding in San Jose to be successful
[SPEAKER_01]: because being so business driven,
there's no friends in business and as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as politicians will tell us we're going to
make a change, we're going to do X,
[SPEAKER_01]: Y, and Z, many times they fall short and
it's exactly that in politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily in San Jose we're finding a way
to make all parties happy, but ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: without equity I am really, and we're
seeing this up north in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle, I'm really not confident about
moving forward in let's say Mountain View
[SPEAKER_01]: or Milpitas which just got canned 4-0 so
there's a ban there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Redwood City I believe is an open
jurisdiction, but as you may most likely
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's a lobbyist game and for me to
pay a lobbyist $10,000 a month to assert
[SPEAKER_01]: influence in a jurisdiction, at the end of
the day nothing's promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take one step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting so far is the goal or
the role of cannabis equity is to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a level playing field for people who
are competing with more corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this may be my misunderstanding,
right, but the people that are benefiting
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis equity are folks from
neighborhoods that were hardest hit by
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like the idea, is that if your
neighborhood's always been dumped on by
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement, now that normalization is
coming, they're trying to help those
[SPEAKER_00]: people get into the game so that they can
compete with more, you know, money in
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the idea and there's conversations
on a national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Booker I believe is looking to
incentivize states to create equitable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry because they're tying in
deschedulization of cannabis to racial
[SPEAKER_01]: justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that translates to equity because
people of color have traditionally been
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested at a higher rate than white
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's cool that this is being
recognized in the way that it is because
[SPEAKER_01]: people like me who have left cannabis
felonies, you know, previously looked down
[SPEAKER_01]: upon, I can now shine bright and be very
proud of who I am and actually articulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the experience that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, going back to the culture,
equity provides the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to say is it's such a
crucial piece because even though there's
[SPEAKER_01]: synopsis in Oakland and San Francisco and
Sacramento is pretty robust, I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: they have 70 permitted delivery services
and LA is figuring it out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a permitting issue,
but it really creates that real
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas many of us, including adept
businessmen are getting into this business
[SPEAKER_01]: and losing out for whatever reason,
it's a volatile industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, to make it kind of simple in
layman's terms, it provides the way for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to really make it in the industry without
having to pay the high fees, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get a break on that whole angle of
it as well, because it really curtailed
[SPEAKER_01]: the point of entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a high point of entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, SB 1294, the state of
California has recognized cannabis equity
[SPEAKER_01]: under a $10 million pool of money that's
looking to be injected to any local
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdiction that implements a cannabis
equity program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what do people do generally
to qualify as being, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that population that's being helped by
cannabis equity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it race based?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it neighborhood based?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, you know, how do they decide who
gets to benefit from cannabis equity?
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, because of the legal
landscape, we can't define it by race.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we define it by A, you meet one of the
three qualifying factors of having gone to
[SPEAKER_01]: a school in San Jose for a certain amount
of years, having a cannabis arrest or a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug arrest for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly lenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you get extra points if you have a
cannabis conviction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the third one is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have a cap on the income saying
that, you know, you can only make a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount of money but San Jose is a
particularly unique scenario in where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to make ends meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went from the 80% of the AMI,
the average income, the average income of
[SPEAKER_01]: the area, average, medium income,
I believe is what it is, to 200% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: AMI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because why should we, you know,
set aside those who have been doing okay
[SPEAKER_01]: for themselves because in reality,
it is hard to make it in a place like San
[SPEAKER_01]: Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those really are the only conditions
and again, the main one is having a record
[SPEAKER_01]: or having an arrest for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be something that isn't a
detrimental factor, which is what we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: with the hemp bill that just passed on a
federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a cannabis felony,
you can't register.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this next question,
I ask this with honor, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things that I've heard
people say against cannabis equity,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, is that it's hard to get in and the
pie is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why should someone who's had a
conviction or is in a more policed
[SPEAKER_00]: population, why should they get in and
potentially exclude someone else just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had the conviction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the idea that the pie is actually not
that small?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is cannabis equity more about cutting
off a piece of pie and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, this is just the right thing to
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis equity is about let's do the
right thing because how can you exclude
[SPEAKER_01]: those that participated in something that
was illegal and now it's legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that just doesn't make sense,
but it's a classic tactic in curtailing
[SPEAKER_01]: mom and kids and some mature and add to
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because truthfully, what corporate doesn't
have and what we have is as a predefined
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis prior to
legalization, prior to Prop 215,
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to Prop 264, excuse me, and we're in
a place right now, the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's a celebration of that free
spirit that I've always said tech doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have anything on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world I think will be magnetized
by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're celebrating it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're able to shift to the legal
landscape, we can help provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience of authentic cannabis culture,
which is what the world really wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want the big rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are for the concentrates and
all these other mass produced items.
[SPEAKER_01]: But truthfully, the number one tourism
destination is going to be California,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though places like Columbia are
popping up for cultivation and big kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting because I, being the chair
of the San Jose Cannabis Equity Group,
[SPEAKER_01]: have to, as an operator standpoint,
I have 20 years of my entire adult life in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given myself to it, so to speak,
and I am grateful to my family for having
[SPEAKER_01]: put up with me and my wife as well because
it's a full time thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's my responsibility to understand
it so that I can give my two cents to the
[SPEAKER_01]: equity program in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a combination mainly of Dr. Armolin's
experience because he's the one who
[SPEAKER_01]: drafted the equity proposal, but it's also
having your finger on the pulse of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry because a lot of times also what
we see is it's an emotionally based
[SPEAKER_01]: decision to where we want to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sexy or it's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're an investor or
the common guy to where we don't realize
[SPEAKER_01]: we might be setting ourselves up to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the last thing we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many people like me who are very
well capable of running our own ship and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go in a top end manner where we
speak cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We personify what the culture really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't money grabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally brings our guard down and
allows us to connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always felt from years ago that it's
going to cause this conscious shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading a cool book that defines
the history of the world by the evolution
[SPEAKER_01]: of the human conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis has, the prohibition of it
has also prohibited us from connecting in
[SPEAKER_01]: a way that when it's passed around freely,
we're going to see some cool shit happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who are watching this in newly
normalizing states, if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with you to learn more about how
you are leading folks and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in San Jose with Candice Equity,
if they want to learn more, how can they
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, on Instagram it's SJCEWG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way to connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southbaydeliverylines.gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to create robust
equity, cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually that does mean equity because it's
so money driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we add so much to the whole
culture aspect of it that without it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like what would surfing be if it
wasn't formed by surfers since the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of a global impact would it
really have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can say dude and what's up
around the world and it's cool or maybe it
[SPEAKER_01]: was frowned upon at the beginning,
but you see people like us, because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been around touching the plant,
there's this whole new experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully if we're successful,
we'll get to share with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for the work that you're
doing to build the model here on the west
[SPEAKER_00]: coast that it can be rolled out everywhere
and thanks for preaching the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Shaka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you.
