[SPEAKER_02]: For pretty much everybody in cannabis
except seed makers, male cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are a scourge.
[SPEAKER_02]: For breeders, male cannabis plants are a
joyful thing and essential to the
[SPEAKER_02]: advancement of cannabis genetics and the
creation of regular seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for nearly all hobby, medical,
and commercial growers, though,
[SPEAKER_02]: males are a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find a male in your garden too
late, he will pollinate your entire crop
[SPEAKER_02]: and decrease its potency and ease of
smoking because the flowers will all be
[SPEAKER_02]: full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminize seeds play an important role in
cannabis nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feminize means that just about every seed
will produce a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: For home growers, it means less room
wasted on plants that will eventually show
[SPEAKER_02]: that they are male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for commercial growers, it means less
risk of pollen in their fields.

[SPEAKER_02]: Today my guest is Caleb Inspekta from CSI
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb and his family have lived in
Humboldt County for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_02]: extraordinary Senesemia cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity Counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recreating them in
[SPEAKER_02]: new and interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to talk with him about
modern feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start by getting a little better
understanding of the terminology we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to use today because, you know,
when most people are talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of seeds we're going to talk about
today, a lot of people just use the words
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the more I study it,
and the more I listen to people who
[SPEAKER_02]: actually breed feminized seeds,
more of them use the term selfed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are talking about S1 seeds,
their first generation of fems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on your seed packets, they say S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you kind of get us all on the
same page by talking about the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: in terminology between feminized seeds and
selfed seeds and what that all means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically selfed only refers to S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a plant crossed to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds is generally, it
encompasses selfed as well, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: covers all the feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, you know, say for example,
you reverse one female and you cross it
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, X, Y, and Z female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all feminized, you know,
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't refer to the hybrids as selfed
or, you know, S1s obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only refer to the individual,
you know, plant that was selfed onto
[SPEAKER_00]: itself as selfed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I cross for a selfed seed
would be, for example, chem dog by chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog versus chem dog versus whatever else
you're going to cross it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So S1s or selfs are actually a subset of
this bigger tent that is feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to add to that,
feminized seeds got a bad rep early on
[SPEAKER_00]: because the selfed, while they might be
the closest, best example of a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, just crossing it to
itself, there's a lot of embryos breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anywhere from 40 to 60% of those
seeds, generally I just say 50%,
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be inbred and just kind of
throw away plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with the hybrids, you get the same
hybrid figure from a feminized hybrid as
[SPEAKER_00]: you do from a normal hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people kind of misconstrued
the whole self thing with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in general when that wasn't even a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to talk more about the early
days of feminized and the bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we leave S1s and selfed seeds,
when you self a seed or when you self a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, you're doing that to, you know,
one expression of one phenome of that
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will the seeds produced by selfing a plant
give you snapshots of all the phenos
[SPEAKER_02]: available in that line or will they all be
that exact phenome of the plant you're
[SPEAKER_02]: selfing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you will rarely get the exact plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically going to encompass all the
genetics contained in the DNA of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how stable that plant is,
it can be, you know, fairly tight to
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think they're going to get
an exact replica of the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get everything from the
absolute worst inbred genetic that that
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA contains, you know, in the recessive
traits to the absolute best, which
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes in S1s, you find stuff that's
way better than the mother plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: selfed in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what I'm gathering from that is,
you know, when you buy a pack of S1s,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really a pack for somebody who is
planning on, you know, digging,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, or looking for phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily, you know,
a stabilized pack that somebody would buy
[SPEAKER_02]: because they want, they want, they want to
know what they're going to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With S1s, you really don't know what
you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you're going to buy a pack of
seven or 10 seeds, you may have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, seven or 10 different
expressions of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then let's, let's jump back to the bad
reputation that feminized seeds have had
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so because I work so much with
patients, you know, I realized early on
[SPEAKER_02]: how useful feminized seeds can be for
patients because, you know, it's so sad to
[SPEAKER_02]: see a patient pop 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know, if you're going
to pop a hundred or more seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you are probably going to generally
see 50, 50 male and female, but at such a
[SPEAKER_02]: small number of 10, you could get any
ratio statistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and occasionally you'll,
you'll find a, you know, a pack or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 10 seeds and you'll get like six
or seven males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for, you know, for a breeder,
that would be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for, for a patient, they're like,
Oh my God, I, I, all my resources and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this soil and all this space I just used
for, you know, these six or seven males
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm going to call.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I realized that, Oh my God,
we could just get these people into
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds and all 10, we'll be
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm, I want this, but, but as I told
people, I was getting into this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, folks were like, Oh man,
feminized seeds like suck and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the vigor and they herm on me and all
this, all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, but then if you ask them,
if you like really kind of drill down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you find out that either a, they haven't
tried to feminize seed in years or B like
[SPEAKER_02]: they heard it from their bro, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, give us a little
context, if you will, about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, how feminized seeds have gotten
better, you know, since they started
[SPEAKER_02]: showing up in the scene and, and what your
thoughts are on today's fem seeds versus
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the stuff that were people were
originally popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people were really
focused on just the S ones early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had a lot of those recessive
inbred genetics coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you popped your fems,
you ended up with, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50% just weak inbred plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when folks started realizing,
well, wait, you need to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: make, you know, hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you, you get this, you know,
that, that vigor back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, the, the herm thing,
it, it's definitely valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unfortunately, you know,
in, in today's, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape, most of the popular stuff is a
result of no selection and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, hermaphrodite a plant onto
hermaphrodite a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you definitely, you know,
will get a certain percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites in feminized seeds,
but that also depends on, um, their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you know, in indoors,
it's, it's going to be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, outdoors, you know,
most of the times it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: non-existent, you know, unless you really,
really stress something out or the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that, you know, the fem,
fem seeds were based on were really prone
[SPEAKER_00]: to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the variable between indoor and
outdoor that causes the, the hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_02]: herming more indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I honestly, uh, you know, um,
I mean, indoors we're, we're putting such
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme stress on a plant, you know,
taking it out, out of its natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you know, exposing it to
this, that, the other, um, a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, light leaks, you know,
I mean, not everybody has just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, light tight rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something as simple as that,
you know, easy to, you know, stress
[SPEAKER_00]: something out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also think that, you know,
since so much of this reputation is built
[SPEAKER_02]: on forum posts, you know, when you're
indoors, you are stressing a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like an Olympian, you know,
it's a, it's healthy and thriving,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is under stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, even at its best, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the best run room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the majority of people are
not running, you know, like put together
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so just about everybody is taking
a plant that is already stressed and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then stressing it out more by,
you know, changing their inputs or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, their power goes out or
whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, so you've got that,
that added challenge indoors as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, honestly, uh, I,
I've always, I've always thought that the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are kind of the core to,
you know, whether a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors you're most people are generally
using small or pots, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallons, five gallons, whatever,
you know, compared to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors where you're using 20,
a hundred, 200 galloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you keep the roots happy,
you know, the whole plant is happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's true with everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, um, indoors, you know,
you got the small root balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to just, you know, tilt them one
way or the other to make them unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, too dry, too wet, too much
nutrient, too little nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anything like that, you know,
too cold, too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and on, but any of those
extremes, you know, are going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, change, change that plants,
uh, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it's going to express itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, you piss off, you piss off
that rhizosphere and suddenly it's sending
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different messages up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so the other thing too, you mentioned
is like, you know, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_02]: just looking to, well, all right,
I guess that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say a lot of people are
just looking to make money in seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's certainly true, but there's,
there's also people who are in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: who are just rookies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and they don't really have
maybe the space or the experience to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of sifts that you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we, we all see like the,
the way people put out seeds right now
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're like, okay, I got,
I got one male and I'm going to hit it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the 10 hot strains in my area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to rush that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, you know, that stuff,
you know, has not been sifted properly and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not even tested, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just running them out the door
while it's hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so to that degree, I think that
what you're saying probably applies to FEM
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, the same way it applies to reg
seeds where, Hey man, there's good FEMs on
[SPEAKER_02]: the market and there's, you know,
sketchy FEMs on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So know your fricking breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not only know your breeder,
but know your genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I mean, you can, you can give a
dozen different breeders the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: cut and they're going to be playing with
the same exact, you know, potential that
[SPEAKER_00]: same variability, that same, you know,
you know, possibility of oops,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that comes out of that cut's
going to be a hermaphrodite, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's where the bad
reputation comes from and really ruins
[SPEAKER_02]: your run.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you mentioned a little bit earlier
about how the, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the FEMs have got the same vigor as,
as a reg version of it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, I often hear people kind
of get confused who don't know a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: the breeding side because they get them
kind of confused with autos, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with, with autos, which I'm also a
fan of, you've, you get these,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you get whatever the,
let's take like a, an auto Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so people go, all right, well,
that's not really like Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a new Keemavar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Girl Scout cookies crossed with a
Ruderalis plant from Siberia, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you, you are definitely taking a
step away from the original phenotypical
[SPEAKER_02]: package of any particular Keemavar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I, you know, the way I understand
it, that is not the case with FEMs because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not, you know, you, you,
you will either get the, the full package
[SPEAKER_02]: of an S1 of that one plant, or if,
if you're going to hybridize it to another
[SPEAKER_02]: one, you're going to get, you know,
the essentially clean phenos of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of those two plants together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there isn't a third plant added to the
mix, like in autos, which is bringing in
[SPEAKER_02]: all these like kind of wild, rooty
genetics from Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so, so FEMs really should be just
like, you would expect the, the reg
[SPEAKER_02]: version to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let's, let's get to the heart of
that, you know, that query.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most people don't understand where
FEMs come from period, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's where a lot of the
confusion comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you kind of go through how
feminized seeds are made?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people, you know, you ask a lot
of people and they'll give you one of two
[SPEAKER_02]: answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll either say, oh, don't you like
dump colloidal silver on them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other folks, you know,
refer to Matt Riott's FEM spray,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so this is the part of it that I'm
least familiar with as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you kind of just talk about the
various ways of getting to FEMini seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically I've always used STS,
so silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what a lot of people don't
realize, this might be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent, but what a lot of people don't
realize is it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got buddies who have tried to
reverse, you know, 20, 30 plants and have
[SPEAKER_00]: never had a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Successful reversal where they got seeds,
you know, let alone even pollen from their
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's the failure point?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I knew, I'd share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm good buddies with,
with Matt Riott.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, we, we, we,
we chat about this same topic quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not unusual for me to
have a failed reversal run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unusual for him, you know,
to have a failed one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've used his spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've all generally, I've always used my
spray, but I've, you know, tried his spray
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've also tried my other buddy,
Hybe, his hybrid tech spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really variable on what works,
when it works and you know, how well it
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's not an exact science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you, do you think that, you know,
and I know, I know that I'm asking you to
[SPEAKER_02]: guess here, cause you already said you
don't know for sure, but do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that, do you think that it probably has
more to do with how a particular plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics accepts it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's about method and
people are just not doing it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has a lot to do with the
individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain people, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be method because,
you know, if, if you can't reverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 20 plus plants, there's
something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their method I'd imagine, but,
you know, I've, I've, I've successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: done, you know, plenty of reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you get tons of pollen,
tons of seeds, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times you get no pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you get loads of pollen and
almost no seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just like, huh,
I don't get this, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't claim to be an expert,
but I'm, I'm a very active student.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and an artisan as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to ask, I'm going to want to
go more into the STS, but before we like
[SPEAKER_02]: go past it, will you address the colloidal
silver thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just an outmoded method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm more of a, I'm, I'm fairly busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with colloidal silver, that reversal
method, you essentially have to spray and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to spray every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that just doesn't work with,
you know, my style or my workload.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need something where,
you know, I only have to spray it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one time, maybe twice and I'm
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, why I go with the
STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, lately I've just been
spraying the one time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I trigger that reversal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was using colloidal, I'd have to
spray every single day that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about its
reliability?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that, you know, we've got a
home grower who wants to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some reversed, uh, who wants to
reverse their plant, but they only have
[SPEAKER_02]: four plants they need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And spraying every day is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do, do, does it have the same,
um, quality of results or likelihood of
[SPEAKER_02]: success as using STS if you've got that
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that time, I know plenty of
people who have had good success with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's a lot of, you know,
hobbyist type work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you gotta, oftentimes,
um, you've got to kind of make it
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically just from raw silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, I've never entertained that
much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so what, what I'd like to do right
now is would you take us through
[SPEAKER_02]: step-by-step, you know, you don't,
you don't have to be overly elaborate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but, um, you know, would you walk us
through what you're doing with the STS
[SPEAKER_02]: spray that causes the feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just break it down to steps
so that people who really want to picture
[SPEAKER_02]: it in their head, what, what it looks
like, or maybe they're actually looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for actionable information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they want to go and try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just, just break it out for us,
would you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically, uh, you're spraying some
form of silver on your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's colloidal silver or silver
thiosulfate, and you spray it on your
[SPEAKER_00]: target female and the silver acts as a
ethylene inhibitor and the ethylene is
[SPEAKER_00]: what, you know, makes your plant female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by inhibiting the ethylene production,
you are essentially, uh, changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone balance, I guess, in the plant to
exhibit, you know, a male and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, if, if all goes well with
your spray and your timing and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, uh, your, your male, your reversed
female male plant will uh, will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, uh, roughly in four to six weeks
from the time you first spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, this plant that we just sprayed
with the STS, our goal with that plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: just to get male flowers to be produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we will collect that pollen
and then hit that to a second plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea isn't necessarily that,
oh, we want the plant to have both male
[SPEAKER_02]: and female flowers and then self
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're talking, we're talking about,
we want to force this female plant to make
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen so we can take her and hit
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, although some people do,
uh, do individual branch spraying on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then they can take, it'll only
reverse the one branch and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll pollinate, you know,
you can pollinate the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that hasn't been sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way I've ever seen it
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea of doing, um, a whole
plant and collecting a pollen sounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd be a hell of a lot easier than going
branch by branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me personally, uh, when I do my
reversals, I'm, I'm generally reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: four to eight, um, plants that are,
they generally finish out at about three
[SPEAKER_00]: to five feet tall and you know,
two to three feet around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm reversing some pretty big
plants, but I'm also pollinating,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good size rooms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need a lot of, a lot of pollen and,
uh, a lot of people don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you do not get even remotely close to
as much pollen from a reverse plant as you
[SPEAKER_00]: do a regular male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why you need the, you definitely
need them because like normally a male
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, a male plant giving off pollen,
there's a hell of a lot of pollen in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why you have to do multiple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so if you're going to be doing four or
six of these, um, are you, are you doing
[SPEAKER_02]: your best to make sure that these females
are either, uh, you know, from the same
[SPEAKER_02]: pheno of seed or are you taking one
primary mother making clones of her?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are all the same pheno and then,
and then reversing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of plants I reverse are all
just heirloom cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, they're, they're all,
all the same cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one other thing I, I,
I do is, um, I stagger them because early
[SPEAKER_00]: on I had plenty of failed runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm trying to reverse and
pollinate a room and half the time it was
[SPEAKER_00]: because, um, the reversal plant either
dropped pollen too early and missed the
[SPEAKER_00]: window or it dropped pollen too late and
missed the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd get, you know, a 10% seeded room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which that doesn't really help me or
anybody out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, nowadays what I do is,
is I'll pollinate, I'll reverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reverse a female, you know,
a week or two in advance of flowering the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the room out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll, then I'll do a, you know,
a couple more, um, at the trigger date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, um, and I'll also use
different, different, uh, different STS
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different STS concentrations, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you're, you're trying a variety so
that somewhere in the mean of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in the middle, everybody will
get the particular combination it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: since everybody's so finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a, you know, trying,
trying to, uh, circumvent failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better your odds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so clearly if these reversed plants
produce less pollen and everybody in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room is more finicky, um, this of course
increases the value of each, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of pollen and, um, you know,
storing pollen can really be a bitch and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it goes bad so easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find, uh, you know, in your
process, are you collecting the pollen and
[SPEAKER_02]: saving it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you all like, you know,
Oh no, I'm just going to put you all in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same room and, um, and it's going to
happen live without any, uh, saving of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I would love to, you know,
have faith in saving it, but just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you know, I don't have trust for
saving the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would, it would be pretty miserable
to be like, I got this room and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, throw a ton of pollen out there
and you get 17 seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where I was going with that is that it
was, do you have a, uh, a pollen storage
[SPEAKER_02]: technique that you trust?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never even bothered to store pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should, I should, but you know,
it's just, it's one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't gotten into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said earlier, like it's
something that you can do with all that
[SPEAKER_02]: extra time you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, let's, uh, let's go ahead
and take our first commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you were listening to shaping fire and
my guest today is Caleb and Specta from
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a listener of shaping fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P is the first organically derived
microbial inoculant that focuses on your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's nutrient cycling processes to
release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: by out-competing potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P is proven to increase growth and
enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_02]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy Mammoth P near you, check out
[SPEAKER_02]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.

beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mammoth P. Growing cannabis in greenhouses
is taking over the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: An efficient and effective blend of
sunshine-grown terpene profiles and the
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment of indoor,
greenhouses can be the best of both
[SPEAKER_02]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many greenhouse operators,
though, building their greenhouse before
[SPEAKER_02]: gaining insight into how cannabis
greenhouses differ from ornamental crops
[SPEAKER_02]: can be the start of a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Branstad and his team at Greenhouse
Advisory Group have the experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: technical know-how to help you avoid these
pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations, design,
[SPEAKER_02]: build, and equip their greenhouses for
over a decade, first starting in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California, but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has an impeccable reputation for both
depth of knowledge and kindness and
[SPEAKER_02]: communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear Eric explain some of the
challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to overcome them in episode number 41
of the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where I go in the country,
good people with smart backgrounds still
[SPEAKER_02]: are making the mistake of building without
knowing cannabis, and it causes them to
[SPEAKER_02]: burn through capital and time fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has their own failure point.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some, it is improper ventilation
planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: For others, it is surface temperatures of
the building or the plant's leaves or
[SPEAKER_02]: both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks that build their greenhouse
from scratch make really basic errors like
[SPEAKER_02]: placement of the greenhouse on the
property or not understanding the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: environment where the greenhouses or
greenhouse sits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have even built a decent greenhouse,
but are inefficient in their deployment of
[SPEAKER_02]: light deprivation techniques and never
really hit their target yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great when you learn from your
mistakes, but it's even better when you
[SPEAKER_02]: learn from the mistakes of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you bring on Greenhouse Advisory
Group, you will learn from the mistakes of
[SPEAKER_02]: their many clients and you'll take
advantage of the best practices developed
[SPEAKER_02]: by Eric Branstad over his years of working
with clients just like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: From location development to choosing a
builder and tricking out your new
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing
your failing greenhouse, Eric will help
[SPEAKER_02]: you through it.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's Greenhouse Advisory Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Caleb Inspekta from CSI
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
generally about feminized seeds and what
[SPEAKER_02]: they are and what they aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the second set, Caleb,
I want to talk more about your particular
[SPEAKER_02]: approach to building feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The great interview that you did with
Kevin Jodry at Wonderland Nursery during
[SPEAKER_02]: the Wonderland Seed Series, Kevin
definitely made the suggestion that you do
[SPEAKER_02]: significant seed sifts, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very active in popping a lot of
seeds and you put a lot of thought into
[SPEAKER_02]: your choices, which I wish that with a lot
more people were doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to give people an idea of how to sift
and what a sift looks like, would you just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of walk us through what you typically
do when you're hunting for the keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, from every reversal,
I'll usually sprout anywhere from 200 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are just feminized
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also run out the S ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The S ones I usually do separate,
and those are usually in 100 lots or 200
[SPEAKER_00]: lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the feminized ones, I just like to
get a good idea of everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contained in the seeds I sell and just see
how things combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the funnest part is watching
them all grow, selecting out your turpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and all your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, at the end,
you got to go through and sample and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out really which ones make it from
your favorite growing plants to your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite smoking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about what your cull points
are, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first cull probably happens
naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that just straight up don't
germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, OK, those genetics are not
going to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm assuming that you probably do
another cull just for mediocre plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't really thriving, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when do you start?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your first cull for plants that are
not obviously failing?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that fail, they're out of the
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how soon do you start saying,
that plant doesn't look or isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: expressing itself in a way that I want to
keep?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that a lot of people
do, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, I usually have a pretty high germ
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually have between 98% and 99%
germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not having a big cull as far as
seeds that don't sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rarely kill a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see every single plant go start
to finish, no matter how small of a runt
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, no matter how weak it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because honestly, some of the best plants
I've ever come across have been these
[SPEAKER_00]: little weak, runty, just weirdo plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are they going to be great for
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, you're not going to afford them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still like to give them a chance and
see what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen tons of breeders who think that
they can cull at the seedling stage or
[SPEAKER_00]: think they can cull in early veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making their decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mostly making their decisions on
structure and vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain things, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a final finished product,
that has nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there could totally be something in
one of these runts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that it's a runt, but you're
like, oh my gosh, it's got this terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile that's out of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would have culled it early,
you wouldn't have smelled that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you know to look for it elsewhere
in the sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, if it's an attribute that you
particularly think is badass, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, OK, I'm going to take that plant and
do something with it to maybe help it not
[SPEAKER_02]: express as a runt, but also keep that
terpene or whatever variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to grow out that many plants,
that's a lot of freaking space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you run them in one gallons or
shorter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predominantly just use raisins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my beds are four foot by four foot by
about one foot deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll generally run anywhere from 16
plants in a bed to 81 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just did a little last year,
I did a run where I had either 72 or 81
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog hybrids in every single bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I had probably less than a 10%
drown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most everything in those beds
finished up just perfectly fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get drowned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a sizable sample of each one to
make my assessments and judgments on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you run them that close,
are you doing a lot of de-leafing or are
[SPEAKER_02]: you leaving them just as the seed intended
so you can actually find the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: leafier and less leafier?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely varies, but I have no
problems kind of taking off the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like overdoing it, but I won't let
them overlap and just completely overload
[SPEAKER_00]: a bed with leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely a lot of cleanup on the
underneaths and also I don't know if this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the right part to throw this in,
but I always make sure about two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, two to two and a half weeks,
let's put it that way, I'll clean up all
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't clean them up early just because I
want to see what type of herm expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you won't see that until two to three
weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I leave all that underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the growth on them until that time
and then I clean them all up and I check
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant and you'll be able to
see any herm troubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times these plants will have
maybe like one ball here or just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: balls per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them generally don't have any and
then very few are really bad herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually see a really bad herm indoors,
maybe one or two per hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they are herming like that
indoors, obviously you are checking them
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is what you do, but are they
a threat to the rest of your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically I'm not checking them
constantly at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check them in that window of two to two
and a half weeks into flower and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the window where they will be
visible, they'll be expressing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they won't be dropping pollen and
sabotaging your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as you check your plants at
that time, it doesn't matter if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing reg seeds, if you're doing feminized
seeds, hell, it doesn't even matter if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing clones from the dispensary or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it should be a prerequisite that
you check your plants in that window and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure otherwise you get what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing this sift of a few hundred
plants and you are looking for the
[SPEAKER_02]: particular traits that you want for that
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you grow a lot of different
types of plants for different expressions
[SPEAKER_02]: and honestly how you express your craft
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a pretty wide variety,
the kinds of seeds that you like to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that you've gone through the
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to find your two favorites
that you think will create the best seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: among those two or are you going to do
this cycle several times and cross and
[SPEAKER_02]: recross so that you can pull out multiple
traits that you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to commit to two at this point
or are you actually going to commit to
[SPEAKER_02]: four to six and then work with those and
bring those down to your final pair that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to bring to the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I make selections, but I rarely
end up keeping them for very long just
[SPEAKER_00]: because I grow so many different things
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, I always save the
mother stock versus any hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time the hybrids,
even if they're just absolutely amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they end up going by the wayside just to
make sure my mother stock is happy and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and has plenty of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predominant sifting I do for keepers
is in the S1 stock where that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the second phase of my company
because I don't remake any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only reversing them and making the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have S1 stock to go through and
refine the S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: into exactly the direction I want to go
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the second phase of my company is
going to be to make all these S2 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I think I'll go to
S3.
[SPEAKER_00]: S3 might be the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where you're just going to
get too much inbreeding past that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll be able to have as refined as
you need for future hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by going to S2 and S3, you're
essentially making a very stable,
[SPEAKER_02]: libraryable seed stock that you can put on
ice and know if you want to call on that
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic line again in six or 10 or 12
years that you've got it encapsulated from
[SPEAKER_02]: this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that stock, say I have 10
different things that are in that S2,
[SPEAKER_00]: S3 form, well, I can start making true
feminized F1s because when each line just
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks solid and stable, then you combine
those together and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something completely different than that
original F1 where it's just say a Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple times a Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you work both those lines for multiple
generations on their own and then create
[SPEAKER_00]: stable on both sides and then cross them
together, it's going to create something
[SPEAKER_00]: way different than just that original
mother times mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about that S1 variability,
I can imagine that a hobby grower who
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to get a bunch of plants that are
similar, all right, phenotypically
[SPEAKER_02]: different, but reliable, they wouldn't
want an S1 because there's so much noise
[SPEAKER_02]: in the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think that for those of us who
are Canvas plant nerds, who just love to
[SPEAKER_02]: see all her expressions, that popping S1s,
even though there'll be losers in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of them, I think that that would be
really fun just for the joy of getting all
[SPEAKER_02]: these what the fuck plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh my God, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's a single S1 line
I've run yet that hasn't just been a
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're talking about all the
weirdness of it and the things that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hidden recesses of these genetic
lines, you and I are both fans of
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet sometimes some of these ultra
purists will say that they're not down
[SPEAKER_02]: with feminized seeds because they're
unnatural.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything that comes from stressing or
forcing the plant is an abomination,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be useful, but it's not what
nature intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd just like to hear what your
thoughts are on the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: unnaturalness of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to ask these same people,
have they ever seen land races grown out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And have they ever seen a land race that
isn't a hardcore hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most land races that come from source,
whether it's Afghanistan, Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand, Colombia, wherever, there are
huge populations of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can almost guarantee that you're
gonna your little land race seeds you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting are gonna be part feminized and
part regular and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing a lot of people don't even
realize is there's tons of male
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most breeders, most anyone it seems,
doesn't really realize that and males can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seeds themselves when they're
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens when a male produces its
own seed is you get a portion that are
[SPEAKER_00]: pure male, you get a portion that are
hermaphrodites and you get a portion that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pure females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole nother topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your response though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like for the people who think that
all the noise in the seed is unnatural
[SPEAKER_02]: like you want really messy go to actual
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature is as messy as it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, one of the things that attracted me to
your seeds when I was first getting turned
[SPEAKER_02]: on to you and your work was that you're
forging your own path, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You choose good genetics to start with and
then you have a vision of what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for and you go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you don't necessarily, I mean
certainly you work with a lot of hot sexy
[SPEAKER_02]: named stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't really seem to care first
about what is popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are following your art and your craft
based on what is exciting you personally
[SPEAKER_02]: next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm curious what you look for when
you are looking for starter genetics that
[SPEAKER_02]: tells you that this might be good for a
feminized seed breeding run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean honestly most everything up until
recently anyway that I've worked with for
[SPEAKER_00]: the feminized is just all old heirloom
stock that I've held for years and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people before me have held for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you got Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I've had that cut for, we're
getting close to 20 years with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Snow, I've had that cut for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem Dog, I've had that for going on
15 years and that dates back all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Triangle Kush, it dates back to the
early 90s as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just working with stuff that I've
held for a long, long time, minimum a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade, often times multiple decades and
things that have been around for the long
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really worked with anything that
is just popular for its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've worked with stuff that's popular,
it's just stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the reason why you're not necessarily
working with the hot trending stuff right
[SPEAKER_02]: now simply because you like the older
genetics that are, they're more refined
[SPEAKER_02]: than a land race but they've been worked a
little bit to be stable without being
[SPEAKER_02]: boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a little bit of a
personal issue with me too though where I
[SPEAKER_00]: know the history of the genetics and I've
watched how genetics have moved over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 30 years and then I also know the
history of the genetics going back
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that's really come out in
the last 10, 15 years, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pretty much all the building blocks
or most of the building blocks that
[SPEAKER_00]: created all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your Girl Scout cookies,
it's just an OG Kush crossed with,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, probably not Derb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a perfect example is when we ran out
the Triangle Kush S1s, there were green
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes of essentially cookies in those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically all cookies is is an
expression of that green OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle Kush plant crossed with a certain
dominant purple strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the only plant that I've
really ever seen that does the certain
[SPEAKER_00]: purpling that the common form cut of
cookies does it's deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so these guys, I mean,
cookies was founded in Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_00]: and the guys who are responsible for it,
yay, cookies fam, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't the most honest individuals
when it comes to genetics and history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, but we nerds like myself
obviously care a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, because you're not worried
primarily for marketing and IP or
[SPEAKER_02]: intellectual property, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually want to get to the truth of
the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're talking about strain histories
and stuff and how you like to use local
[SPEAKER_02]: heirlooms, I read a lot and listened to a
lot of your other interviews to prepare
[SPEAKER_02]: for our interview today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I remember correctly that the
Humboldt Snow that you use is a purple
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush Keemavar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the Humboldt Snow is a kind of a
tricky one that I'm still working on
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking down the full story on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, we do know it came out of Eugene
back in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were stories I heard around Humboldt
talking about blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I know a handful of cats who
actually brought it down from Eugene in
[SPEAKER_00]: like 95, 96, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the cut in I think 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a story up in Eugene how it
was just a selection of four way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of my boys have been talking to
the cats kind of involved up there with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those who are really in the
know seem to think or seem, they claim
[SPEAKER_00]: that it actually came to Eugene from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we're still backtracking
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost wonder if it's not just one
of those old hash plants that were popular
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early 90s out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hash plant, it had a heyday back
in the late 80s, early 90s in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just wondering if, and I never
pretend like Humboldt or where I'm from is
[SPEAKER_00]: the source of everything wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so many hot pockets
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fan of whatever quality genetics and
where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blind to, oh, we're the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also, and I'm gonna make a
judgment, but I also would guess that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one of the reasons why you tend to
be one of the more polite and play nice
[SPEAKER_02]: with everybody breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you wanna have relationships with
these other pockets around the country and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't get access to other people's
networks by being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why I asked about the
Humboldt Snow as an example was because
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done a lot of crosses with the
Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also know that you are hellish a
choosy with what you're gonna cross with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was it about the expressions of
Humboldt Snow that you saw that made you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make it a major player in your
lines for a couple of years?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I'm asking to kind of
inform your answer is there are people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are listening who want to do this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they may model their
decision-making process kind on how you
[SPEAKER_02]: thought through the challenge as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of tell us a little bit about how
you decided to choose that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: chemo bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, honestly, it probably has to do
with, I've just had it for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I got it back in 1999,
we actually traded this cat, this cut
[SPEAKER_00]: called Uriah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an inherited cut from my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we traded Uriah for the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very first time I ran the snow
out, it only ended up being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, six inches tall or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it produced four grams, but it was the
whitest stuff I'd ever seen at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was, and we actually got it a
snow cap and it looked like a little snow
[SPEAKER_00]: cap mountain, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, anyways, the last time I
grew it, like a full light of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did like two and three quarter
pounds from a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its yields are definitely, you know,
have potential over that four gram initial
[SPEAKER_00]: trial run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just really learned how to grow it
really well back in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just growing that cut taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a lot of it indoors and then I grew
a lot more of it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, you know, a really solid,
you know, quality plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: High potency, you know, great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a hashy kind of old school,
little bit of pine, little bit of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this and that, but a little bit
of pepper, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just kind of an old school,
you know, solid plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's interesting that
you pulled out, because I thought you were
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to go for, you know,
typical variables like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the chirping profile and the
structure and the yield, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just your basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you went right to, I had a
relationship with that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, wow, that's a different
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I know her, I know how to
grow her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a successful run with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, she's very resinous,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, eventually is also a
good yielder too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea too, because that's a
really different kind of growing than what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're seeing commercially right now,
where people are just hitting lines with
[SPEAKER_02]: their male of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, you know, very few people are
sitting on mother's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts from 15 years ago either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the advantages you have,
you know, not only living where you live
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, in that Emerald Triangle,
but also having a lineage like you do
[SPEAKER_02]: where, you know, multiple generations of
your family have been growing there for
[SPEAKER_02]: ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty good network for
attracting genetics your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, honestly, you know,
I got into the whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: internet forums and everything,
you know, in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, really, you know,
helped to create access to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of really high quality, you know,
fellow growers and breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: aficionados of just cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, bless the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for all the things that it annoys
us today, everybody being able to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: contact with each other and connect and
share genetics, photos, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I mean, it was, it changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go ahead and take our second
commercial break.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we come back, I want to talk to you
about the naming of your strains because
[SPEAKER_02]: your names, the names you choose are
great.

[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Caleb Inspecta from CSI
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Caleb, you know, one of the things I
enjoy about your packs is the names that
[SPEAKER_02]: you choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of people in the
modern, more commercial market are just
[SPEAKER_02]: taking names that have nothing to do with
the lineage, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, you know, they'll make A and
they'll cross it to B instead of the final
[SPEAKER_02]: name being AB, they're like, it's called L
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, all right, well,
I can tell nothing about the strain based
[SPEAKER_02]: on the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've always thought that's
one of the cool things is that it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: verbal puzzle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, what in this name
conjures other, you know, other chemo
[SPEAKER_02]: bars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the word, you know,
blue or dream, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you can, you know,
in the early blue dream cross days,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you could tell where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a certain artistry in naming
those things because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: very often the strain names don't
naturally fit together easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty unrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to kind of come up with a
poetic way to put those together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the scene is moving away from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many of your chemo bar names are so
playful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you must enjoy doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like, what's your story on how you
name your strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got to give credit where,
you know, credits do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my names early on, they were okay,
but they weren't nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started doing name games on
Instagram, I would, you know, I'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand people chiming in, you know,
with just to name one single strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get so much just, you know,
so many options and just all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: clever names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the Instagram community is
is where all all of my best names come
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having by having contests,
it allows people to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: participate and, you know, I think it's
win-win for me, win-win for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody who, you know,
ends up winning, you know, the contest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gets the very first free,
you know, free seeds of whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: named.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also as somebody who loves to
read those threads, it's just fun to read,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like 300 people's ideas,
even if they're not going to be the one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's usually a whole bunch of
fun and a lot of laughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the way I do it is,
you know, I'll break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll I'll write out, you know,
my 20 favorites out of the out of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the thousand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I'll have those
written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always, you know, have whoever
suggested it, you know, at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and sometimes I'll go back and
I'm like, you know, even if I'm not having
[SPEAKER_00]: a competition, I'll go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still love this name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I could use it for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hit that person up and I'm like,
hey, you know, I'm going to use your name
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want free packs of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I haven't had anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the answer is always yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's been disappointed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's it's it's it's a
lot of fun for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and it also, you know,
really takes a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: weight off of you to come up and be like,
Uber, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, so like some of your some of your
strains, I'm just going to pick three that
[SPEAKER_02]: I particularly like on your stuff that you
put out for for this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, so one of my favorite named is
the mozzarella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's UK Cheese and Chem Dog 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, like, how much fun is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then girl's best friend is
also, I thought, pretty creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Girl Scout Cookies and Chem Dog
91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much poetry in that girl's
best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's her dog, Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just feels, you know, it feels
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then one that I'm excited to
grow this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always wanted to grow the Big Sur
Holyweed and and and have never had access
[SPEAKER_02]: to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you put out Sacred Snow,
which is the Big Sur Holyweed crossed with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know what she's like yet,
but it's it's it's not only cool to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to play with something that's part
Big Sur Holyweed, but I like the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: you chose a name that that really focused
on the the Holyweed Sacred Snow kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Baja, you know, vibe where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's one of the things,
you know, I really appreciate when people
[SPEAKER_00]: go for because not a whole lot of people,
you know, get like the Big Sur Holyweed
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids, they it's it's not popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: People most people don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time I run out a Big Sur
Holyweed hybrid, they're the fucking best
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse my language.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the best plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it produces some of the
nicest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter the hybrid, the the the
sacred snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dog, you know, times Big Sur
Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think I've even released
those ones yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those things were beasts, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's one of those things,
though, that it's some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants and just, you know,
gorgeous overall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, something popular is
just going to outsell it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like you, you really have to come
across some of the the lineage stories
[SPEAKER_02]: written in a magazine about Big Sur
Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, like, I didn't even get turned on
to it from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got turned on to it by listening to an
interview with a poet from the Big Sur
[SPEAKER_02]: region talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, my God, I'm learning about,
you know, a new strain from a poet at a
[SPEAKER_02]: college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went backtracked and I and I
found out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it's not a trending thing,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get outsold all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but clearly, you've got a depth of
experience and you're clearly excited
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which just makes me more excited to
grow with the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually concerned, though,
because, you know, I think it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go longer than the first or second week of
October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which means that it's going to have to
be in a in a tent where I live in on
[SPEAKER_02]: Vashon Island in Washington because we get
the rains here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything I've heard about it is that
she's tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a big plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's just a big plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just going to crush my, you know,
you know, my seven, eight foot ceilings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like on a basic tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have to figure out
something special for her for this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a plant and plant for
every place.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll be a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's that's one of the reasons why
I've been so hot on auto flowers recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do I like them because,
you know, I'm always selecting for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping them like get their their home
grows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you don't have to worry about
them growing into the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never personally played with auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my buddy Hybe, he he's been breeding
auto flowers for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually going to be selling his
his auto flower seeds on my Humboldt CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: site here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely see the value and I will
never hate on an auto flower because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just just like we say,
you know, a time and a place for all all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we're going to if we're going to
do that, let's let's hit on your your
[SPEAKER_02]: Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so it's it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually where was I recently that it
came up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at the regenerative agriculture
conference that Joshua Rutherford,
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch Blooms took across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Michigan and they put up Wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not where it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was just a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture that you put on Instagram of
the Australian bastard he he's got in his
[SPEAKER_02]: in his slides to as an example of the wide
ranging variety that the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: has that we haven't even accessed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I like Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stopped by at the Emerald Cup and sat
down for a good probably half hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: just amazed at that Australian bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, well, he he remains excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely love his enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a he's a good, intelligent fellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think that between this
summer and next summer, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the the real coming to prominence of auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, certainly the quality of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have gotten a lot better recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you know, Jeff Lowenfels has got
his book on auto flowers coming out in
[SPEAKER_02]: October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and and I know I personally got
turned on to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have done like a whole year of auto
flower content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I mean, I'm interviewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just had Jeff here on Vashon Island
to do an auto flower presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm doing an auto flower panel at
Cultivation Classic in Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm all like, well,
if this is what everybody's going to want
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn about, let's try to get them good
information to start instead of have to
[SPEAKER_02]: unteach all the rumor that usually comes
with something new.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's circle back around to names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to get your thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, there's a lot of people
usually kind of green rusher new business
[SPEAKER_02]: types who advocate for the for the
simplifying of of strange names.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they're all like, you know,
you need to know too much history to to to
[SPEAKER_02]: to to know these names and unpack them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I understand how people
knew to seeds and breeding and purchasing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to simplify it so that they can
kind of dumb it down so they can sell the
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I personally think that feels like
some culture vulture shit, because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think one of the beautiful
things about cannabis culture is the
[SPEAKER_02]: creation of these names, whether or not
you're making them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're home or you're getting them from
like wonderful crowd, crowd, crowd
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing, you know, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really important aspect
that we need to aggressively preserve in
[SPEAKER_02]: our culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's definitely pros and cons
to the whole name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, the names have
definitely gotten a little out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the flip side, I mean,
you you you you really can't just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: calling something, you know, especially
generation after generation after
[SPEAKER_00]: generation blank times blank times blank
times blank times blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use just the original strain names,
that's going to end up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a little long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you need original, you know,
unique names to describe and define.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like how you put it, you know,
where a lot of these names don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to do with, you know,
the plants they're trying to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's almost imperative that the
name has something to do with the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, personally, I think I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it helps everybody involved,
the the consumer, the breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and certainly it's a you know,
it's just a valuable thing of our scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another way for us to express
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and certainly there, you know,
some names can get us in trouble,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, you know, like Gorilla
Glue and Girl Scout Cookies specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's dumb that that stuff ended up
getting litigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, all of us in the scene
need to be need to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, even even you have got
some strain names that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: will probably never become popularized in
magazines simply because it's called coked
[SPEAKER_02]: out Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, when I when I you know,
that's Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Humboldt Snow, when I first saw that,
I just started howling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an inside joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, you're not going to
hear coked out Girl Scout in any crossover
[SPEAKER_02]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and just just for the record,
just for the record, I don't use any drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever except for cannabis,
maybe an Advil once in a great while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I guess that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that that name itself is a
perfect example because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, oh, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You named it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a little bit of sense of humor and
don't take it so serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's not going to be on the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be on the dispensary
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was named so it can end up on a
dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coked out Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's just for fun right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and even though it's,
you know, it's a it's a bold title,
[SPEAKER_02]: it still actually fits the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl Scout Cookies and Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it fits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's probably enough on
naming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that whole topic, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as you know, a lot of people say
that you should not breed with a feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: mother from a feminine seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A complete nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shut those people down every single
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if you breed with a sour diesel,
a chem dog, an OG Kush, an X, a Y or a Z,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already breeding with a feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to breed with anything
popular, and I'm including Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies, cherry pies, this, that,
the other, everything that stems from any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to sit on that high horse
and be like, oh, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, well, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you breeding with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and I already I already hit the
whole land race thing where you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what exactly those seeds are that you're
you're you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just just a couple more things before
we wrap up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for for folks who are long time
multi generation traditional growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably everywhere, but I've run into it
most in the Emerald Triangle area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's said sometimes by by long
time growers that certain strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got are kept close and not shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just curious, as somebody who
did not grow up in Humboldt, I can only
[SPEAKER_02]: guess why those are not shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, so, you know,
they they don't want it to get in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hands and be belittled by pollen chuckers,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's like a family secret special
sauce for their for their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but you live there and you grew up and
you probably have some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so what what do you locals what what's
the motivation that locals have to hold
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts close and not share them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easy economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the supply is small, you know,
I mean, you know, you're going to fetch
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, a high dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's essentially always been about
the money on that tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason really to hoard
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, when everybody has it,
a perfect example is, say, a purple urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got purple urkel back around
2001, 2002, not a whole lot of people had
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, and the people who had it
were, you know, if you if you were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you had that trust and
everything, they'd be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, have a cut, but don't go giving it
out to, you know, a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fast forward, you know,
four or five years from there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it essentially or it eventually
got out and, you know, got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of people had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then the price started
dropping on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, you know,
aren't really quality growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have a love for their
craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just trying to pump out
something with the name and not given two
[SPEAKER_00]: shits, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they watered down for
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if if you hold something
tight and you keep it tight, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that demand is never going to end,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can put it out itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so, you know, it may not be the
level of popular that something gets to be
[SPEAKER_02]: when everybody's growing it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you essentially have got, you know,
a monopoly on that on that intellectual
[SPEAKER_02]: property, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I would say that we're
probably in that arc right now with
[SPEAKER_02]: Capuletors Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where where, you know, at the beginning,
people lost their fricking minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, it was, you know,
barely available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just through like whispers and friends
around, you know, the where near where you
[SPEAKER_02]: live and then like the first flowers,
you know, were like wildly overpriced in
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we've got to the point now much
later that that, you know, lots of people
[SPEAKER_02]: have got the cut gotten the cut one way or
another, probably by by breaking caps
[SPEAKER_02]: rules around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and now every, you know, everybody's
hitting it with their, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting it with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we are probably on the
far side of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That arc, which is why, you know,
even probably Cap himself, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's moved on to his his next projects in
his crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting, though, that to
watch that that arc from nobody's got it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a rumor and then there's just
pictures and then and then it becomes kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of available at an insane price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it kind of gets washed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you bring up a perfect example,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get asked, you know, from time to
time, you know, friends that friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine are like, we got to hold this tight,
you know, we can't let it get out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people get it, you know, then it
won't be worth nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why are we worried about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I'm working on 10
projects that are probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: better than that, you know, in a year or
two, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know, I think it's it's fear
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people get stuck with,
you know, thinking, oh, they only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: little thing of value and they got to hold
that tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, I got so many things of
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the people acting on a scarcity
mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, that's how I feel about
popping my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have lots of respect for people
who collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not really a seed collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to get my hands on good seeds and
then I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know, certainly,
you know, people who are breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to sit on stock for,
you know, they're they're building their
[SPEAKER_02]: palette of colors for a future breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but since that's not my shtick,
I just like to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, hell, I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like even your seeds, you know,
that are they're sitting in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to popping all this
stuff this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and because you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to you're going to put more
stuff in the market next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, so long as there are
people like you who are doing the work of
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting and sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to do that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's certainly no question that
that you're going to keep on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out quality things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so there's no reason to have that
scarcity mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got seeds, pop them and grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boy is a underrated and Garth
Cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got this new rap album.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a track on there called Grow
Your Own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my absolute favorite track on the
whole album.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like rap, you know, it's cool if
you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that you posted snippets
of on your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good track.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the video is pretty fun,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's it's stylishly done and
it's all in the frickin Redwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually just out yesterday with a
big schmo and Garth Cultivator underrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Lep was even there shooting their
latest video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that Grow Your Own track,
they haven't, you know, released that yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's on the album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is my favorite track of the
album, because that's that's that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see people just grow in their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and, you know,
that's that's the whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: message of that of that track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they teamed up with Mendo Dope on
that track, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're big fans here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, you know, liberating the plant,
everybody becoming a gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, you know,
there's a lot of truth to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's no reason why
everybody shouldn't have a few plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: their yard every summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sunshine is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you an emotional connection to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing tastes as good and is
emotionally as awesome as the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you grew yourself versus the, you know,
the stuff that you're going to pick up at
[SPEAKER_02]: a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that doesn't mean that it's going
to hurt the cannabis market either,
[SPEAKER_02]: because like, you know, I grow my patient
grow and then I also go to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow tomatoes every store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow tomatoes every summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also know I'm buying them at the
store, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's that's a perfect one,
too, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole reason people ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot on Instagram, like, what's the point
of, you know, growing or working with this
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian bastard cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to you mentioned earlier,
you said, you know, your Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: bastard cannabis, it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kid who sourced it, you know,
painted forest farms, painted forest
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, that is his.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just working with him just to
clarify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the Australian bastard cannabis,
it is something that people will not
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow it in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the way it is right now, it's
unrefined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the ruderalis that created the,
you know, auto flowers before it got
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridized and, you know, bred for
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is and it's bare bones building
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're giving people the opportunity to
breed it themselves or to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: work from the starting point of quality
hybrids to breed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say that it's not
recognizable, clearly the plant itself
[SPEAKER_02]: visually does not look like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a fern or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but you've had the flower,
I'm assuming, at this point, when you do
[SPEAKER_02]: the do the flowers look like cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so when you if you got a bag of it,
you'd be like, OK, this is weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though the plant does not look like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody recognizes weed or cannabis by
its leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it doesn't have that canvas
leaf, whether it's an indica leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa leaf, it does not look like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk by a fully flowered out plant
of Australian bastard and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that kind of looks like, yeah,
it don't have the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a shrub.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a really strange plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on that on that fun note,
let's wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Caleb, it's been a real joy to talk to
you, to be able to chat with you about
[SPEAKER_02]: this and to, you know, really,
you know, break down feminize seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to kind of get everybody on the
same page and also to be able to enjoy a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of your stories from being
down in the trenches and doing this for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so thanks for sharing some of your
valuable time with us so that we could get
[SPEAKER_02]: to know, you know, you and feminize,
feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to find out more about CSI
Humboldt and Caleb, there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways that you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend that you follow his
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is enjoyable and educational at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so his Instagram is CSI underscore
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another old CSI Humboldt
Instagram profile that comes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't want the one with hardly any
followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: His his the one that he keeps updated is
is, you know, 200000 followers or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to follow that because you'll
be able to watch the progress of this
[SPEAKER_02]: Australian bastard plant as well,
which you can see pictures of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you want to get yourself get your
hands on some of Caleb's seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to go through his distribution
website and that's you flip the name
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at Humboldt CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he breathes as CSI Humboldt,
but the distributor is called Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's at Humboldt CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's got not only his feminize
lines, but also his reg lines and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually the Australian bastard lines
and and your buddy Hibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Auto flowers are going to be there soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so so definitely check out Humboldt CSI
dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last thing is actually how I got
turned on to Caleb, which is a great
[SPEAKER_02]: interview that Kevin Jodry did with him at
the Wonderland nursery seed series back,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually the first thing that
shaping fire sponsored the first event
[SPEAKER_02]: that we sponsored.
