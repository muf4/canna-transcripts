[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin, a lot of people are starting to
plan what they're going to do this summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like to road trip to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already in California,
you want to explore different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you're moving your
operation from this location here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt to another location in Humboldt
near the historical one log location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to encourage people to like pack
all their stuff in their car and come out
[SPEAKER_01]: to your new location because after I've
toured it today and seen what it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, it's almost like an amusement park
for cannabis and outdoor people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you tell us a little bit
about what people can look forward to when
[SPEAKER_01]: they visit this new one log location on
Highway 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one log is a giant redwood tree that
was driven around the country in the 50s
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's right in front of our spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably one of the most
well-known redwood landmarks in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go inside the tree and it's
basically a little house, but it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: size house inside of a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fascinating to have that
historic piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we put in a dispensary
and a nursery that one can go and tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to the nursery and look
through a window and see what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the nursery itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of people that want to see
cannabis in a nursery form, they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the storefront will allow you to be
able to purchase products from our region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also putting in a museum that'll
cover what is Humboldt County from a land
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view, meaning what makes Humboldt
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the history of Humboldt County's
basically exploitation over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 68, this reclamation of a
culture where Humboldt had been hacked to
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces and gold mining and lumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 68, you have a back to land
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that movement forward,
the entire cannabis world we know now in
[SPEAKER_00]: America was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be able to show all these
components because they've never really
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always show pharmacopia, which is
cannabis medicine that was allowed before
[SPEAKER_00]: they outlawed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow in cannabis, duck in the
helicopters, the indoor revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big plant revolution, how 215 really
changed the region, how Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new legalization has changed the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that point, 2018 forward,
what's our future with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also really it mirrors what's our
future with cannabis in all small counties
[SPEAKER_00]: like Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that museum is what I'm excited about
because it's the first time we've ever got
[SPEAKER_00]: to really do something like that,
where you get to cover what were pot
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, a model in camouflage with
a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up with all these mockups of what
it looked like for people in the bushes
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying soil bags, climbing up hills,
ducking helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did indoor grows look like that were
entire buildings that were filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did underground bunkers look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a grow dozer, which is the super
trucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the significance in generators
where so much of the indoor revolution was
[SPEAKER_00]: created under generator power?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the things that people have
to understand so they can understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of an industry so that they
don't believe that the industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: created January 1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this new industry that we see today
somehow happened overnight on its own with
[SPEAKER_00]: no history behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the history behind it that lets
you see an evolution and lets you be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of choices and directions and how we got
to those directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it allows the people who see
it to be able to make better decisions on
[SPEAKER_00]: how they purchase cannabis, and how they
view cannabis, and how possibly they even
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get to realize that this was
really a true homegrown movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't come to Humboldt to grow
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came here to escape the world in 1968
and they wanted a counterculture life that
[SPEAKER_00]: was less violent, more communal,
more holistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process, cannabis was
cultivated and then all of a sudden it
[SPEAKER_00]: started to be sold and it organically grew
this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of Humboldt County Cannabis is
very much like Dennis Perrone's model of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis where friends of his were
ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He created a situation that allowed people
to get free cannabis because they noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that the people who were ill did better
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He creates the first cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He creates the first real social network
where regular people who didn't have real
[SPEAKER_00]: connect could come there and be treated
compassionately, meaning that you were not
[SPEAKER_00]: ostracized for your lack of money or your
lack of social rank or your choices with
[SPEAKER_00]: your sexuality or color or religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Perrone didn't care who you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you needed cannabis, you could come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could afford it, you would buy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't, you would get it for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the basis of Humboldt County's
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very important to understand
because it lets you see how the humans
[SPEAKER_00]: behave when they're allowed to behave that
way and the beautiful things that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important, I think, for people to
know this so that they realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: regular people made this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular people created compassionate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular people created the industrial
cannabis model we're in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows you to say, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't created by these big companies
or these big branded firms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was by regular small people who did
this, which means you're still very valid
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you have an ability to make
change yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when you see these
things, it empowers people to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: in whatever you're into in life,
you may have way more impact than you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: believed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to see these iconic figures
and iconic times and iconic places to
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, it empowers you in a
way that you can connect with because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, wow, the cannabis is gonna be
a trillion dollar industry globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the United States, which is really
driving this thing forward so hard in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large financial point of view,
it was created by a bunch of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were barefoot in the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically hillbillies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge statement because it
wasn't created by these mega companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that said, look, this is what cannabis
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is they're taking what
cannabis was and they're just repackaging
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a nicer TV set telling you,
this is what it should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I want you to be able to go
back in time and understand what drove the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of the museum
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the museum lets us bring in locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then advertise the locals that do
production or have a history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then sell their products at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location is got a set up in the back
for music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for just basic lounging to where we
don't have any official smoking spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people can pull off the road,
enjoy the museum, check out the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a coffee shop and a restaurant
connected to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the back, there's a beautiful park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can come and just take a break and
sit down and enjoy and realize that Humble
[SPEAKER_00]: County life was beautiful life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis fueled a lifestyle that was
really holistically healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only later on that it became
this incredible money chase where people
[SPEAKER_00]: got kind of a little lost in the pursuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the root of it is the most beautiful
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to pull back and
show is that the roots of this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: are not dirty and they don't need to be
hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be shamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed the region to be able to
get a little different view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who want to come out and
check out the museum and see some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome rare photographs you've gotten,
some of the cool models, and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up some local product at your
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I saw the beautiful lush field
in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are a couple of the big music events
that people can focus on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they're going to come out
anyway, they might as well come out for
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these events and really be able to
have a whole experience while they're
[SPEAKER_01]: there and maybe spend the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're really fortunate that we're
right next door to French's camp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the site of Northern Nights,
the electronic music festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequently, we're right next door to
the same French's camp where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both of these events have been
historically, I think Northern Nights is
[SPEAKER_00]: in its sixth year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae might be in its 30th, 30th plus
year, maybe even a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been to like 25, 26 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to so many I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really awesome festivals
because they're outside on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been purchased by larger
companies that have the ability to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with production.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these smaller festivals needed
assistance because everything's so
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive nowadays in producing these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so High Times was able to lease the
reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Emerald Cup crew,
which was Tim Blake, and I believe a red
[SPEAKER_00]: light or I'm trying to remember the name
of his exact name of the guy that he works
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take on the Northern
Nights crew with the existing Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Nights crew so that what you have is you
have some combined production on these
[SPEAKER_00]: different venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the events then can really succeed and
shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever wanted to see an
electronic music festival that goes on for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while, that's in I believe July and then
the first weekend of August of every year
[SPEAKER_00]: is reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you make it to one of these
events, we're literally right next door to
[SPEAKER_00]: them on the driveway through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just look to your left and you'll see
the one log and come on and visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's cabin lodging, there's
camping, there's even VIP five-star
[SPEAKER_01]: lodging down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have beautiful hotels in the area,
the bimbos down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some really upscale stuff and
you also have some really normal stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Eel River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can escape your life from the
concrete and come to Humboldt where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's very little of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allows you and it's not that
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean really it's only about three hours
from the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 101 is a straight pipeline up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very simple, you can't get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it relatively convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you come up here, you're in a
world that makes you think you're back in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for so many people that they
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the festivals in Humboldt are
typically, excuse me, very nonviolent,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are trying their best to enjoy each
other as people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes this beautiful type of
environment that's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anyone who hasn't had a chance to
check out the stuff here, I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we were in the shop or not,
it's really the festivals themselves have
[SPEAKER_00]: been supernatural for the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people have fallen in love
with Humboldt because they came here to
[SPEAKER_00]: see music and they met the locals and
realized, wow, you guys were all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the locals here aren't just men,
it's men and women of all ages and all
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and all sexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Humboldt is one of the most really
diverse group of production grids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world where everybody who came here was
accepted as long as you didn't want to rat
[SPEAKER_00]: out your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get to experience this really
genuine, open type of situation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really get in life too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in urban areas, no one wants to
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you can actually sit down and
have a conversation and feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, I'm so happy that they were
able to put the production teams together
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep these festivals running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a long-term stability on
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should really shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The region should shine because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see you this summer at the one
log location on Highway 101, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So will you turn that off?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question I don't want to have
recorded.
Yeah.
Okay.
