[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that the new year means for most
of us is an opportunity to renew and
[SPEAKER_01]: relaunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the time to make plans real,
make smart decisions, and reach for things
[SPEAKER_01]: that may seem unattainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've been wanting to try something
new in your cultivation recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: now might be a great time to give it a
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you following along on the
Shaping Fire Instagram account,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that I'm experimenting with my
first Sea of Green-style grow in a 4x4
[SPEAKER_01]: tent in the Shaping Fire offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I got inspired watching Caleb from
CSI Humboldt run Sea of Green for many
[SPEAKER_01]: years and finally found the time myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop by the Shaping Fire Instagram to
check it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: While talking about Instagram,
though, I want to make sure that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: how sketchy it has gotten for cannabis
businesses on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already noticed,
Instagram is intentionally pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business businesses off the
platform to support their new teen safety
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until now, cannabis accounts were
primarily flagged by folks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community reporting each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, though, Insta is using keywords and
image recognition to automatically flag
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants and words like cannabis
and cultivation and clone, causing
[SPEAKER_01]: creators to be shadow banned or deleted
automatically, often with no way to
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram very truly does not want us
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet Instagram is where we all connect
with each other as a cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is going to knock many cannabis
businesses and podcasts out of existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is talk of moving to Twitter or Blue
Sky or Threads or Noster, but none of
[SPEAKER_01]: these have the participation of a
significant percentage of our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing beats Instagram in that guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we all leave Instagram, the community
will be splintered as we go different
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are interested in continuing to
follow your favorite cannabis content
[SPEAKER_01]: creators or businesses, be sure to connect
with them in a secondary way that is more
[SPEAKER_01]: direct, something like signing up for
their newsletter.

[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy New Year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode one hundred and
nineteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, Eric Branstad returns to shaping
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: To talk about small greenhouses for home
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric has been a greenhouse and farming
advisor for over 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started out in the Northern California
heritage market, helping cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize their greenhouses, learn light
deprivation techniques and avoid many of
[SPEAKER_01]: the common errors that impact cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: His reach widened with the adoption of
Proposition 215 medical in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: which started Eric working across the
state, both selling commercial sized
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses as well as offering top tier
consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since normalization began creeping across
the country, Eric has become one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most respected names in cannabis and a
thought leader in cannabis greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helps multi state operators and smaller
family businesses across the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he works with indoor cultivators to
Eric has been on shaping fire as a guest
[SPEAKER_01]: before on shaping fire episode 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric was here to talk about cannabis
greenhouse rescues when the worst scenario
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and you've got to save your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: A specialty of Eric's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, gosh, all the way back 100
episodes and eight years ago to shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire number 13 titled Maximizing Yield
with Light Deprivation Techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both great episodes today will be
discussing greenhouses for home
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: While our insights today are applicable to
most greenhouses that are 20 by 20 and
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller, we are especially focused on the
green or white greenhouse kits that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sold on Amazon and elsewhere that are used
by folks all over the world and are in
[SPEAKER_01]: easy greenhouse solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never seen one of these green
horticulture plastic greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you want one specifically that I
use, there's a direct link on the shaping
[SPEAKER_01]: fire dot com page for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we will discuss
the advantages of using a greenhouse no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter where you are in the country,
recommended sizes for your needs,
[SPEAKER_01]: placement on the property, anchoring,
venting, flooring and bracing of your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the second set, we will look at
dealing with heat and cold issues of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and how to keep your growing
parameters dialed in as well as pests from
[SPEAKER_01]: insects and rodents up to deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finished the episode looking to
upgrade your small home greenhouse with
[SPEAKER_01]: light depth, adding lights, heating coils
for the soil and how to properly store the
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic over winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in all, a jam packed episode of useful
ideas for the home cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Eric, welcome back to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Shango, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glad to have you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the biggest question probably at
the top is why bother with greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can talk a lot about the
details of greenhouses, but for many
[SPEAKER_01]: people they're like, you know,
I don't really want the money and the
[SPEAKER_01]: expense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just fine growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked for me and it worked for my
pappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, this is the way like it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when I used my first
greenhouse, I was really caught off guard
[SPEAKER_01]: by how much better my plants thrived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you make this pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pitch to people all the time about why
they should upgrade to a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you start us off with that?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, most people when they
grow cannabis, you know, have trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the fall, you know,
towards harvest season or harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say, you know, the weather can start
to turn bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to get colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to, you know, possibly even
rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, throughout the growing
cycle, depending on where you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be a reason for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people in New York deal with rain
throughout the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're pretty lucky here in
California through a lot of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or outdoors been pretty,
pretty easy for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for, you know, some of the years
we've had some, some late or early rains
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, the greenhouses
provide a benefit of protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to hide your plants if
you don't want the neighbors to see
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also provides a great structure to be
able to pull a light depth cover over if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do the light depth technique
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bunch of reasons to use a
greenhouse for cannabis, but it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a double edged sword using a
greenhouse in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you noticed out on the islands
where you are in Washington, it became a
[SPEAKER_00]: great benefit rather than just going
straight outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, with cannabis
being the Michael Jordan or the super
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that it is compared to all other
plants, it just seems to do really well in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really well put.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really just gives us options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it gives you an opportunity to,
you know, boost your warmth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you need to cut down on
your wind, if that's what you need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it more discreet, if that's what you need,
it just, it just makes options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and really these, these kinds of
greenhouses that we're focusing on today,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you started in, you know,
NorCal doing all the, all the gorilla and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like OG hidden stuff and then grew
into medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you're consulting at least
all over the country, if not all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world in these big, you know,
multi-million dollar schticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but what we're talking about today
are these, these small $200 greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if you get them on sale,
like this time of year now, like December
[SPEAKER_01]: for the following year, you can get things
that'll be like $350 in May for like 200
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that buys you a lot of options
comes the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my business and previously when I
was in, you know, selling greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely was shooting for the big
stuff, but we did spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when I started out with the
greenhouse company in 2006 and seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we were carrying smaller greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, granted, they were automated and
expensive and way more expensive than any
[SPEAKER_00]: would want to spend even now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were really hyper-focused on,
you know, the home grower and the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a 10 by 10 and a 20 by 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, we created a hoop house that was
16 by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was still kind of big, but at the
same time, you know, our, our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our thoughts were always with the home
grower outside of, you know, targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the commercial growers, which was
really, you know, what the business had to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the home grower was really
where, where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, with the medical side
of things, we had a lot of home growers
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the new legalization in
various states, you know, home growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: still allowed in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it never really went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think that it's a great
opportunity for people to give it a try
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, especially these more
affordable options that are out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's, let's talk about the
footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, you know, you can buy these
green greenhouses, lots of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people buy them on Amazon,
but you can also buy them at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of agricultural stores if
you're not into Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I have to mention Amazon
because so many people write to me saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just picked one up on Amazon and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing that if 90% of the people
who are writing to me asking questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about our buying them on Amazon,
that that is, is kind of the default for
[SPEAKER_01]: most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: For better or for worse, I have bought
maybe five or six different brands on the
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while none of them are particularly
sponsoring shaping fire right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to clue folks in that I have
liked the quick tent brand Q U I C T E N T
[SPEAKER_01]: for their new upgraded stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but really I have not gotten a bad
brand yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, take a look and see
which one's on sale and which one looks
[SPEAKER_01]: good to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But specifically, let's talk about
footprints, Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that seem to be predominant are,
you know, 15 by seven, 10 by 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 by 10, and there's a lot of 25 by 10s
all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why there's so many of the
different sellers are using the same
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint, but it wouldn't surprise me if
they were all buying their framework from
[SPEAKER_01]: the same company in China and then they're
all just rebranding what they put on this
[SPEAKER_01]: skeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts in trying to figure
out the size that you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't surprise me if most people
just go for, I'm going to get the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have got room for on my property,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people are like myself,
I needed to get one that I knew would be
[SPEAKER_01]: two rows wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least because I wanted to be able to
walk down the middle and have plants on
[SPEAKER_01]: either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were selling these greenhouses,
not the cheap ones I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you were selling was much nicer,
but it had a similar footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of guidance did you give people
when they were trying to determine what
[SPEAKER_01]: size they wanted?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a great question because
everybody is a little different in what
[SPEAKER_00]: they expect or what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the greenhouses that I was dealing
with, sometimes it came down to price.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had a budget and this is all I
could really spend, so we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can get out of this budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, people just felt like,
hey, this is... People have a thought in
[SPEAKER_00]: their minds of what is safe to them and
what is not, or what is reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what is maybe out of reason to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would call with,
hey, this is the size that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, they're not terribly
bigger hoops than the ones you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, but they are bigger in width and
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common size greenhouse that we
sold back then, especially in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: days, was a 16 by 48 or a 20 by 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure why, but the majority of
customers that would call would always
[SPEAKER_00]: stick with this 48-foot long greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't because that's the size of
their backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just seemed to be the reasonable size
in everybody's minds at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the greenhouses that
you're talking about in the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: setting or the home grower setting,
it really comes down to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What fits in somebody's backyard,
maybe without being too much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: eyesore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it fits in the backyard and it still
leaves room for the animals and the kids
[SPEAKER_00]: to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something that isn't going to
look too big to the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause them to call and complain
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of reasons of why people
pick these different size greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one that you picked or the
company that you're talking about has
[SPEAKER_00]: really found the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the hobby greenhouses that have
been on the market and currently on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market are typically square or rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually the clear polycarbonate
that is similar to glass and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are difficult to put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are fairly flimsy in some
regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to find the right hobby
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you haven't seen a lot of the
hobbies be very popular until this one
[SPEAKER_00]: came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying, there's been a lot of
people liking and buying this greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: off of Amazon or similar to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because it seems to fit that
reasonable aspect of shipping,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting together longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sizes they have seem to be reasonable
with where people want to stick those in
[SPEAKER_00]: the backyard or at the home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago now, there was a big
upgrade in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to be all that really cheap,
white, bendy, aluminum-y kind of metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one bad storm and they would mess
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, at once, all of the
companies said, upgraded, and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to galvanized steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be when they took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were one step closer to the adult
greenhouses that you're more familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly, they're like, oh, if you get a
little bit of weather, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: People started going with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's really important to
note because a lot of the greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: even the greenhouses that I've put
together over the years that are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more commercial-grade, I guess you
could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much for a wind to pick up
a greenhouse and move it, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby ones or even the bigger,
more commercial ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather and wind and things can really put
a hammering on a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the amount of little
greenhouses like yours that took sail in a
[SPEAKER_00]: windstorm and blew off the property or
maybe got damaged from some severe rains,
[SPEAKER_00]: was enough complaints or notes to the
company for them to go, oh, here's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they made that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, collectively, they had to have
enough people complain or have problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with them for them to see that change
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think sometimes you can see
the writing on the wall and people just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to try out the flimsy stuff first and
see how far it gets them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about height some because most
of these consumer backyard greenhouses top
[SPEAKER_01]: out at 6.6 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this does not set one up for
monster California's outdoor-sized plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be aware of that and probably
topping your plants at least once and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's frustrating because with these
hobby greenhouses, they have the curved
[SPEAKER_01]: roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really only get the 6.6 apex at the
middle of the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your walking space along the
middle, you've got the head space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then your plants are going to be
topping out at 6 or 5.5 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an argument you made to put the
plants in the middle and walk yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: around the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you're in the middle,
it makes it harder to tend to every side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant because you've got them
doubled up in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of advice or thoughts might you
have about an abbreviated height
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that cuts off at 6.6 versus
somebody who's got a commercial greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can go as tall as they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that we need to look at it
as there could be worse problems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world than too big of plants and not being
able to get around sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that maybe that could be a
good thing even though it can be tedious
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little bit annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, I always advocate of
trying to put plants in the middle or
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the center if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at wintertime growing,
and I know we're focused more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime, but there is the season
extension and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to have your plants closer
to the walls of the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are closer to the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being away from the walls gives you a
chance to keep things warmer for three
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I think like what
you're talking about, topping and training
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of states,
and if I talk about California in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, the home growers are only
allowed to grow six plants legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you want those six plants to be
as big as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really dig in or look back,
maybe there's nothing to look back at
[SPEAKER_00]: literature-wise or podcast-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I look back or think back,
I start to think about some of the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really before the 2-15 days and into the
2-15 days, there were some growers up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine, Joey Berger,
the Humboldt local, one of the unique
[SPEAKER_00]: things what they used to do is they used
to start their plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be done in a greenhouse too,
but they would actually lay chicken wire
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground over these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could grow a six-pound plant and it
would never be taller than three feet just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the way that they trellised it
down with this chicken wire and did this
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy ground technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few people I've heard over
the years that recognize that method or
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen it or heard about it or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's amazing what you can do with some
of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have seen how there's growers
and artists that will do bonsai to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and these crazy root systems that
come out of these nice features that they
[SPEAKER_00]: create with the pots and the bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cannabis plant can do incredible
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surprising of how much trellising and
bending and keeping a plant spread out low
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ground that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that on the easy side,
yeah, topping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But secondly, how far can you spread your
plants and how much can you bend them and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say a lot of, but it takes some
extra work and tending to do some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it isn't out of the question to be
able to train your plants to grow low and
[SPEAKER_00]: still stack on good weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know from when you've been on shaping
fire before and we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: large-scale greenhouses that you put a lot
of blood, sweat and tears into studying
[SPEAKER_01]: the placement of big greenhouses on the
property and studying microclimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lovingly encouraging the owners
to put the greenhouse, the smart place
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of necessarily the convenient
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to backyard greenhouses,
I would say the same is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet you have even more pressure like,
oh, but that's where the garage goes or,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's where the dog run is or,
oh, that's where every summer we put up
[SPEAKER_01]: the pool or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of demands on somebody's
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, assuming that they have options
instead of just it's the only place in the
[SPEAKER_01]: yard for it, can you give us some
thumbnail suggestions for where we might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to place the greenhouse on the
property?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, one of the things that
we'd look to is that whenever people call
[SPEAKER_00]: for, and this technology is changing over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's apps and more things now
on our phones to sort this stuff out than
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But originally when a solar person would
come out to give you an estimate for solar
[SPEAKER_00]: on your house, they would have this
device, handheld device that would
[SPEAKER_00]: basically tell them where the sun was and
the shadows are for the 12 hours of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would come out with this
handheld device, stand in a few spots and
[SPEAKER_00]: look and see where the trajectory of the
sun and the shade is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say, ah, this is the
sunniest spot on your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you want your solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of started adopting that same
idea with where do I put my greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put it in the sunniest spot
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would use some of the same
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said, with the apps and other
things that we might use as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments or tools, we can still do the
same thing and maybe do it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more affordable or a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that one of the things
that I like to look to is to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the fall sun or the late summer sun
is really intense or really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that is that I lived in
five acres of pasture land for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sun really wasn't that big of a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently I moved 20 minutes up the
road and I'm in the forest and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally barely gets any sun here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not the greatest place for
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did find a really sunny spot and I
thought I'd give it a whirl this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: put out just three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even use a greenhouse because I
just wanted to test out this new spot
[SPEAKER_00]: after we cleared some trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while the spot was really sunny
throughout the summer and the plants grew
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly tall, as we started getting into
the fall, the sun started changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I got a lot of shade when I
needed a lot of sun for the ripening and
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where it suffered the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that a lot of plants will
veg and grow pretty well, even in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of shade or some shade in the
afternoon, mixed shade, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to have the seasons
change and that sun becomes diminished
[SPEAKER_00]: during the flowering time, that's where
you're going to be the most bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I would recommend is trying to
make sure that that sunny spot you pick is
[SPEAKER_00]: sunny all the way through the finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you happen to be in the forest
and you say, oh, this is a sunny spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be true, but is it going to
stay sunny the entire time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not, I would find a place or
cut a tree or do something to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get that late summer sun for the
flower development and the ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so true, especially if you live a
place that isn't as gifted with
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, whether it's California,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like up here in Washington, my son
disappears.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my first couple of years here,
I was positioned where the sun was in July
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was all excited to bring the
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by third week of September,
it was cutting across the sky differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we already have such a hard time
finishing plants where I live that you
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to put that tent where you're
going to get the most bang for your buck
[SPEAKER_01]: in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other places, October too,
but we can't grow in October here where I
[SPEAKER_01]: live at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about, now that we have
figured out where they're going to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: our property, let's talk about anchoring
them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of people are just all
like, well, it's a big greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to fly away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, it's going to fly away if you
don't tie it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what professionals use,
but all I've done is I've picked up a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tent stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wrap a industrial size zip tie
around the bottom metal bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I create a loop with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put the stake through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do, on my 20 foot by 10s,
I'll put like six of those on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding it really down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally during the summer,
I might lose a zip tie, but not all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do adults use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a handful of things
that people do to secure their
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think all of them could be looked at
as a good or correct way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes things resonate with one
person better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one idea resonates with somebody better
than the other idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the bigger, fancy,
stronger tent stakes like you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about are a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I've used is concrete
stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And concrete stakes are basically heavy
metal bars with a pointy end on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have holes drilled into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, with a lot of the
greenhouses that we did, some of them we
[SPEAKER_00]: did, as you know, as booths for trade
shows and lounges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was other people that wanted to
do a similar greenhouse, but they knew
[SPEAKER_00]: they were going to move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't want to auger the holes and
cement them in like you're supposed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the plans say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when some of the greenhouses maybe
have a baseboard at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a small two by four or
something like that around the base
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter of the greenhouse, even if
there's not one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the concrete stakes work really well
because you can get them in an 8-inch,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-inch, 24-inch, 36-inch concrete stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really drive them down pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have it right up next to the
greenhouse, you can use those holes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pre-drilled into that concrete stake
close to the top once it's all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: tapped in and run some wire through it,
run a zip tie through it, or even take a
[SPEAKER_00]: screw and screw it right into the
baseboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stays pretty well attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so concrete stakes have been popular,
rebar, cut up into various lengths and
[SPEAKER_00]: sections has been popular, kind of doing
the similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other people that have taken rebar
and bent it in half so it makes kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a horseshoe or a U-shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're basically driving it into the
ground, maybe straddling something of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, maybe a bottom sideboard or a
purl in or something that maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: attach to and do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that people have done is
similar to what you maybe see when people
[SPEAKER_00]: put up those party tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or circus-type tents for get-togethers and
things is where they actually throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratchet strap over the entire greenhouse
and attach it to something that's fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, there's been places
where we've put things up that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to drive stakes into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fill up a bucket with cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll take a five-gallon bucket,
dump a cement bag into it, and fill it
[SPEAKER_00]: with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically have this hardened
cement bucket, for lack of better words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will even put a fancy hook
maybe inside that concrete so that when it
[SPEAKER_00]: dries, you actually have something to hook
to that concrete inside the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people will put the buckets around
the perimeter of the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw these straps over the greenhouse,
and then attach them to these buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not to be ratcheted down so
tight that it's actually pulling your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse down, but it avoids it from
being able to take off or lift off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listening to you name off all these
different solutions, I just felt so proud
[SPEAKER_01]: of stoner ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take these plus all the ones that
we're not even going to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are always figuring stuff out in
new and novel ways in our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could take whatever we just
explained and hybridize it or do it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit differently with the same
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you and I learn something.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't surprise me that we've already
mentioned Joey Berger as an innovative
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis person, because he's always
posting about, oh, I'm trying this new
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate people who are
thought leaders like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessity is the mother of invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've smoked a couple,
you can really go out there with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's talk about the skin
when the plastic is put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only and biggest issue that I have run
into with a season of plastic is when
[SPEAKER_01]: there is rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: it often creates divots in the plastic
where water will collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people who have got more professional
greenhouses will immediately say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's not pulled tight enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have channel locks on either
side of the greenhouse to really lock that
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these greenhouses are much too small
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what those things are called,
that little wiggle wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's what it's called, wiggle wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it called wiggle wire?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like these greenhouses are just
too small for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could, but you'd probably double
the price of the greenhouse by adding
[SPEAKER_01]: wiggle wire minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, what we're talking about is ways
to support the roof differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year was the first year that I tried
just simply to run rope back and forth
[SPEAKER_01]: between the ribs that would create
additional support in between the ribs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely took it all apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try it again next year with a
thinner rope wrapped more times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything at the professional
level that you recommend to people to help
[SPEAKER_01]: fill in those gaps between the ribs so
that the water doesn't create little
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that happens even on big greenhouses
or traditional greenhouses or commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grade, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come down to sometimes the way
these things are manufactured and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of ten, not everything is
100% ideal, but it's close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do suggest to make sure that when people
do put their plastics on, they try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it on a sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to pull out the plastic and
maybe lay it on top of the greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground right next to the greenhouse
and let it get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, as most people know,
when things are warm, they're a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more pliable or malleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things are cold, they're a little bit
more stiff and harder to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most, if not all, greenhouse plastics are
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to lay it out, let it get warm,
and really try to stretch it on as tight
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible so that when it does cool
down, that contraction is what creates
[SPEAKER_00]: that tighter fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To basically hold things on a little bit
better, it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people use the really sticky,
fancy Velcro from Home Depot to try to rig
[SPEAKER_00]: things up using lath or PVC in conjunction
with the ropes like you talked about to
[SPEAKER_00]: create purlins and things that go between
each rib to try to make the structure more
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always help the plastic,
but sometimes when you're messing around
[SPEAKER_00]: with things like you're talking about,
you go in and you do something and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, we have this aha moment
going, well, if I was to do this again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that's where you are with
your possibilities of redoing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year I did this, I tried packing
tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great, but it broke over the
course of the year just from the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this year was rope, but I need to
come up with a different pattern so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets more coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, if you thumb through some
of the greenhouse catalogs, there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs that get sent to you in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the online ones like Greenhouse
Megastore, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some others out there on the East
Coast like Griffin Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that sometimes when you're
going through these catalogs and these
[SPEAKER_00]: online things, you run into new things
that could be applicable to a homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell a lot of do-it-yourself parts
for creating backyard and maybe homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: or do-it-yourself greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, there are certain parts
and things that we run into that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful in whatever greenhouse you're using
or the one that you're talking about in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, there's stuff out there that's
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't noticed it because we're
flipping through the pages so fast looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly enough, there's even a place
here in Grass Valley called Peaceful
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley Farm Supply that ships a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, they've had greenhouse
parts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of looking around and
really trying to engage in what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for your plastic and seeing if any
of these other things might fit or work or
[SPEAKER_00]: help in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that generally speaking,
getting greenhouse plastic tight so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't hold water is pretty common for
everybody in the hoop house and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: game because Mother Nature is pretty
powerful and she typically always wins in
[SPEAKER_00]: one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it's kind of an ongoing
situation to be worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouse is at this grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plastic is just held on with Velcro
hoops so they can slide all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: galvanized steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that we can do to anchor them to
the ground is going to be a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I want to talk about is
actually the ground on this topic before
[SPEAKER_01]: we go to the first break.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is whether or not to put flooring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really been torn on this over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one hand, I have liked leaving my
greenhouses just bare dirt because I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: grower of the soil food web-mindedness.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of having the floor be natural so
that there are voluntary pest predators
[SPEAKER_01]: that are growing there naturally and the
water has somewhere to soak down into,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just seems like it makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if we've got uneven ground,
where there are all these little divots
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can twist your ankle in,
or if you live like where I live where
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a lot of varmints, you've
suddenly got them growing little holes
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath your pot so they can drink the
water during the drought of the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really goes both ways about whether
just to leave the ground natural with
[SPEAKER_01]: grass or whether or not it makes sense to
put down a couple pieces of plywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you weigh in on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the home grower, it's really up to
what their perspective is on all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought up a lot of good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely beneficials and there's
definitely some things that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial that could show up in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that if it's just plain dirt
without grass, it's good to put something
[SPEAKER_00]: down because when you're irrigating or if
some rains come or whatever, that dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: does get wet and it tracks up mud and next
thing you know, you're starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff everywhere and it becomes quite
messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even had people on just plain dirt
put down the ground cover that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended over the years and when that
stuff gets wet from irrigating or leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: a hose on or just dribbling around when
you're moving from place to place with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hose, the mud will start to seep through
the ground cover even.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the idea of having the grass is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can be fearful of the pests because
the grass can be a nice little habitat for
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you maybe don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the rodents, the rodents
are definitely a little bit of a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: and so putting down some wire mesh
underneath maybe could help keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: rodents from coming up and getting
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plywood isn't a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are a little bit iffy on
plywood or wood in general because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the regulated market, what we learned
is that wood and cardboard and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things can have this aspergillus and
maybe even cause some post-harvest molds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of that is a whole other podcast
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, wood can get moldy just
by nature in general and so that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a thing for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use pressure-treated wood,
it has chemicals in it and in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those chemicals could
bioaccumulate in your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that another popular solution,
people like to go find those plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're plastic or
polycarbonate or what they're really made
[SPEAKER_00]: of, but the pallets that are not made of
wood, they can be fairly expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you can find people tossing
those and use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I think that
anything reasonable would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pallet could be used, but that's wood
also, a regular wooden pallet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's people that will paint those
with a low VOC paint, maybe even a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: deck stain for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just putting some gravel down isn't a bad
idea over the dirt in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of gravel goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use the ground cover,
I would recommend putting something
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath it, maybe even some straw down
before you cap it with the ground cover
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you don't have the mud that comes
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using the containers that you're
using, some of the containers can take up
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cover the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are doing these beds or raised
beds, a lot of times, they will even use
[SPEAKER_00]: bark around the beds as a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bark is pretty safe in most regards for
the fact that the weeds don't like to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: through it as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the bark doesn't seem to have the
same moldy effects or negative effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that wood does, like plywood or things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, the mulch from wood chips
can have a lot of beneficial qualities to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, with the fungi growing into it,
having that mycelial mat growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it keeps the weeds from growing
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for a nice, cooler atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get too hot like some of the
other things do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just be on the cautious side,
knowing that maybe if someone was to use
[SPEAKER_00]: certain ground covers like black,
black can get really hot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime, and it can heat up the
greenhouse more than you want it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe have adverse reactions to the
environment in the greenhouse just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it stores and collects so much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a benefit to some people,
though, that are in places like the
[SPEAKER_00]: islands or areas where it stays fairly
cooler, and they're trying to get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that free heat into the greenhouse and
warm some things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of that would be using
something that's a lighter color,
[SPEAKER_00]: a white ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of that is why,
over the years, we've recommended people
[SPEAKER_00]: use a tan grow bag versus a black grow
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because black gets way more hot
than a tan grow bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that can be a benefit in some
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went to a farm recently that does
put down the black this time of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is colder, and they're trying
to get as much free energy as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do switch the colors up for their
fall run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of that is that if you're
going to be using your greenhouse in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime or the summertime, so you
really want to be strategic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's only the summertime, then you
might be able to get away with just a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less or a thinner layer of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going through the winter,
then I would recommend probably going into
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of a gravel base to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might cap the gravel with the ground
cover, a pallet or wood or something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the gravel is really helpful in the
wintertime to keep from sinking into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I love having you on the
show, Eric, because you have such a depth
[SPEAKER_01]: of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you gave that elaborate answer,
I was going through every one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: situations and it brought to mind two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, how you always teach that
there's no right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the best way to do it for where
you are in the country, what your weather
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, what your growing goals and what
your budget is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave us a bunch of options depending
on what our goals are, and I dig that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, hearing you go through the list,
I can almost see you go like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: that guy did this and we had to fix it,
and this guy did this and we had to fix
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really going through the greatest
hits of problems and solutions that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: had to deal with with different clients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe fortunately for me, unfortunately
for some of the growers that I've showed
[SPEAKER_00]: up, a lot of the work that I've done is to
help people in a rescue situation or
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up to work on one thing,
and I see another problem going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot of years of being able to
see what works and what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say, like you're saying,
there's not one thing that is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every farm is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one cannabis farm that is
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every greenhouse I go to has a different
way of setting it up or doing it or
[SPEAKER_00]: heating it or the flooring for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same way across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger, the fancier the greenhouse,
the less similar it is to any other
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you get to the very basic,
simple home jobs, you get to actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis and in growing in general,
whether you're doing vegetables or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but it seems like with cannabis
especially, there's always two steps
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and one step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily a bad thing,
but it's really not something that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect situation all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're burning money.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to go ahead and take a
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is OG Greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: Consultant, Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: so please support them and let them know
that you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message is for folks who grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to home growers, patients and
commercial growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plan out your next growing cycle,
be sure to check out Humboldt CSI Seeds at
[SPEAKER_01]: humboldtcsi.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb Inspekta and his family have lived
in Humboldt County for over a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last 40 years, three generations
of his family have cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary sense of mea cannabis in
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of his lineage and the hard-earned
experience that comes from growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and sifting large populations of
cannabis plants in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds you'll cop from CSI will be
winning genetics based on long-time heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: hitters and updated and resifted to bring
out new and exotic traits and better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and ask around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb, also known as Inspekta and Pirates
of the Emerald Triangle, is a breeder's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reaches way back and works with
significant strains, recruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating them in new and interesting ways
that you'll love as a toker and a grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as offering you some surprises
that will delight serious seed traders and
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI goes a further step and selfs
all these chemovars so you know all the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not experimental feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt CSI releases some of the best
female seeds available anywhere and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will show in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks grew quite a bit of CSI Humboldt
GenX last year here on Vashon Island and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients had beautiful female plants
and didn't have to cull half of their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden as males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks growing for the fun of getting
high grew colorful flowers with
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptional bag appeal and great highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeders had seven out of seven
females in a pack, which gave them a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of phenotypic choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a moment right now and visit
HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find an up-to-date menu of both
feminized and regular lines, along with
[SPEAKER_01]: photos and descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's HumboldtCSI.com Revenue is tight
for cannabis businesses right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when revenue tightens, businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of throwing obscene money at
hanging your company's logo from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rafters at your next convention,
perhaps consider placing commercials on
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are a very small business,
there is simply no better bang for your
[SPEAKER_01]: buck than commercial on shaping fire,
especially if your products are for
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneratively minded cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable and help
[SPEAKER_01]: our audience get in contact with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising does not have to be all whiz,
bang, smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately and
[SPEAKER_01]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna make your own commercial
spot, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a commercial on shaping fire,

[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_01]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_01]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_01]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognizable by its traits, traits that
were hard earned so that you can have your
[SPEAKER_01]: best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 10 years, Gnome Automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_01]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing gnome automatics
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages,
[SPEAKER_01]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_01]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is greenhouse consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the first set, we figured out
where our greenhouse is gonna be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property and we got it all set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start talking about how to deal with
some of the common challenges that are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with having a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's start with heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk regularly about the difficulty of
abating heat in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that we attract,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want the warmth and we want the
heat because the plants want it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also don't want to cook the plants
or make them too thirsty or dry out our
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to hit this sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming that our number one health
problem helper, ally, for keeping our heat
[SPEAKER_01]: low is going to be fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that you have got a bunch of
strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't I just kind of hand you the
mic and say, what are the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should be thinking about for abating the
heat when we're setting up our small 20 by
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 foot greenhouse?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, primarily the greenhouse itself
hopefully has some ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the one that you're talking
about actually does with the big door in
[SPEAKER_00]: the front and then down the side,
it has all these windows that roll up or
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so similarly to other greenhouses or
well, let's back up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other hobby greenhouses also
did not have or not equipped with enough
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times they have just a little
louver that opens by hand and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one on the roof or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so historically speaking, most of the
hobby greenhouses that have been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market turn into little storage sheds in
the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't get used in the winter
because people are happy with storing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because they get incredibly hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing people forget is that
greenhouses were invented for the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: or when it's really shitty out,
not when it's a perfect hot sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when cannabis came along, the best
time to grow is when it's hot summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so boom, we put these greenhouses out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are not really for that time of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have all these problems or heat
buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I said, the vents are really
crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these greenhouse covers is also
an important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the clearer the cover or the
polycarbonate, the more exposure to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that people talk
about is the word heat, but we're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the air temp, we're talking
about the heat that is associated to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's two different things that I
look at in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one might be the air temp
obviously, but the other is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant temperature itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at that by simply even using a
handheld laser thermometer where you point
[SPEAKER_00]: and the little laser comes out and you
point it to where you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tells you the temperature of these
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really handy to take one of
those devices and aim it at the flower of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant or even a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually see that the plant
temp is typically different than the air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so monitoring that really helps a lot
more than just looking at the air temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in some cases, if you have enough
ventilation and maybe a good greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: cover that isn't totally clear like glass,
you might see that there could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in leaf surface or plant temp
compared to the air temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, you're on the
right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or things will probably be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's the opposite, where the
greenhouse is warm inside and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: temp is actually warmer than the air temp,
you're bound to run into problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew mold, botrytis-type mold,
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to end well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we try to look at is that,
like you brought up, fans are definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: popular thing to move some air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's still sealed up and there's
not enough fresh air coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fans are just going to move that air
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the one thing that I always like to
tell people and the phrase that I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: live by a little bit is that if you trap
air, it will heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the key for a greenhouse in the
summertime, especially a home grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: even maybe a commercial grower that has
not such a fancy setup, kind of a basic
[SPEAKER_00]: hoop house, is that we want to not trap
that air so that it heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we try to take away this greenhouse
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's OK to have the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not always OK to have the
greenhouse effect, where it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer and warmer inside all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can break that by opening up the
greenhouse and avoiding trapping all that
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on a greenhouse like the one you've
showed pictures of, in a place that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: gets really hot, I would say that the
benefit would be to put doors at both ends
[SPEAKER_00]: of that type of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, it really slows down the
ability for that air to be trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we have these openings,
let's say we just have one door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The windows are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still might have a little bit of solar
gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not have the same amount of solar
gain if everything was sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still has a little bit of solar
gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit warmer inside than it is
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we put that other door at the other
end, we might have now alleviated the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability for it to act like a total
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to actually see the same
temperatures inside the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we do outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people might say, well,
it's 100 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 100 degrees inside the greenhouse,
we know that we've avoided the solar gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get it cooler by any
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is to not let it get more hot
inside than it is outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we've gotten to that point,
then we start monitoring the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: or the flower temperature of the plant
with our little laser thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to start to notice is
that maybe those temperatures are similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other or, in fact, maybe a little
bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're definitely on the right
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where some circulation fans
might actually help a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now once we've avoided the solar
gain, we move a little air across the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be in a racetrack pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be one fan at one end
blowing across this small greenhouse so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it creates a slight breeze or mimics
a slight breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening is the plants
actually become a little bit cooler than
[SPEAKER_00]: what they originally were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I have leaves kind of dancing
in the circulation of the fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see a 3 to 5 degree temperature
difference than we would if the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't experiencing any air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants and people are similar in
the sense that plants have all this water
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through their system, just like we
have blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our blood's like, I don't know,
70% or 90% water anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have the circulation going on
between ourselves and plants with this
[SPEAKER_00]: water moving through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on a hot day, if you go and stand
in front of a fan, it'll have a cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on our body because our sweat,
our perspiration basically is starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get cooled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, we might even stop
perspiring, even though we're still out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fan has created a little bit of
relief for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a plant doesn't perspire like a
plant person does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It transpires, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a plant is transpiring and we
start to blow some air across it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will eventually start to cool down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that transpiration process doesn't go
away, but it slows down quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody that's had a plant that is
transpiring, it's hard to see because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not like sweat on our forehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just see it dripping down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see is we see condensation
forming on the roof of the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to drip back down onto our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so condensation typically is a result
of plant transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we try to work on getting our
plant temps in check, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid that condensation that everybody is
trying to avoid or get rid of and not deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of coincides with the light
depth technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put your plants in a light depth,
cover them in this bubble with a blackout
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, there's no air coming in or out a
lot of times, especially traditional ways
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your plant temps are up when you go
to seal it up, you're instantly going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see this condensation form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people that are able to keep their
plant temps down compared to the air temp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why I'm saying there's not a
perfect number that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking for plant temp to be
lower than the air temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically don't see that condensation
form throughout the day, and you don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: it show up as much when you pull your
light depth cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so another thing that helps with that
is the greenhouse cover itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing that you have that green cover
on your greenhouse, it does provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the reinforcing strings that go
through there that makes that cover more
[SPEAKER_00]: durable than it would be if it was just a
plain piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does provide some diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, the diffusion is also
maybe another way of looking at shading or
[SPEAKER_00]: another way other aspect of diffusion is
scattering infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so infrared is what brings the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're basically trying to disrupt
the infrared, but we're still trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get as much light as possible to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times with the clear glass
covers, you don't have that protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually can magnify the light at
times, and it'll make the plant temp even
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer than it should be or warmer than
you want it to be just because that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: these plastics work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so originally, when I first started
selling greenhouses, that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: originally thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the clearest cover possible,
like glass, because outdoor plants are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're growing with lights indoors
back in the day before LEDs and all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted as many lights as possible,
and they wanted them turned up as high as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we automatically thought the same
thing for going into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we learned is the sun is intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most intense light bulb we have
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times, the overexposure to
plants can be too much throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having the right greenhouse cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the green one in that
picture is a great option for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that the upgraded version
is a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the product name of it,
but it's a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost didn't think it was a
greenhouse cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sun master.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a bunch of different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this white one actually does let light
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked incredibly well in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that the white upgraded
version that they have offering for your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse would be suitable in some of
these areas like Arizona, New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even California, where it can be
extremely hot sometimes, where that white
[SPEAKER_00]: will actually diffuse and calm down that
infrared or that heat that's being brought
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the plants, but still provide enough
light for a great growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, somebody might just use
the openness of the greenhouse for
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation to take away the greenhouse
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, they might use the
greenhouse cover to make sure that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: or works even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing would be adding
that circulation fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now somebody might want to do all of these
things into one aspect of a greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the most support or protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in some areas of the country,
one of those things might do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question about the fans before we
go on to cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what you just said, it sounds like a
positive strategy would be, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: a box fan set up as an intake at one end
of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got mine hung just simply with
Velcro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Velcro, a zip tie to the rib.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the other end, you have an
exhalation end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it creates this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes in one end, and it's being pulled
out of the exhaust and at the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe for the leaf temperature,
maybe a couple oscillating fans in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got an intake on one end and
exhaust on the other end, and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of exhaust fans in the middle just
moving the air around on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you were describing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I say the no part of
it is because here's a couple of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not necessarily directing this
towards your setup, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized aspect or outlook on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can put too many fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening, let's just
say, in the idea of fans at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes people will have fans at
both ends pointing inwards, and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: only air coming in and no air coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like this positive pressure
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what ends up happening is the air
comes in at a high volume, but it has
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so inevitably, it heats up,
and it becomes hot inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like what you're talking about with
a more negative pressure idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a fan bringing the air in,
and maybe there's a fan at the other end
[SPEAKER_00]: helping it shuttle its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that can happen,
though, is that some fans, and this could
[SPEAKER_00]: be even using the same exact fans,
not all motors and manufacturers are
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there can be flaws in some of these
ideas or setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I mean by that is that you
could have more air coming in than you
[SPEAKER_00]: have coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases, what I've seen in
even commercial, the big fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, is that they have so much air
coming in that it actually heats up before
[SPEAKER_00]: it's able to travel out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, what I've seen is
there's too many circulation fans on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that does is it draws more air
into the greenhouse than it would just
[SPEAKER_00]: using the exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exhaust fans are designed to bring
in this air and shoot it out the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have circulation fans inside
that are bringing in more air,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like if you were trying to put
a hose in your mouth and drink all the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up having water blowing out your
mouth, and your cheeks are full,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the same kind of, I don't know if
that makes sense, but the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing happens with the fans is that the
circulation and maybe the exhaust draw in
[SPEAKER_00]: more than the exit fan can handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're basically having air that's
sitting around in the greenhouse waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for its chance to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, it's heated up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to make sure, and in some
cases, maybe that's the idea for some
[SPEAKER_00]: farms is just to have that exhaust fan at
one end that's blowing the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it's doing is it's capturing air
at the other end and naturally bringing it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the canopy and out the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would just say that more air
movement isn't always better just because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in these structures, and there has
to be a way an even in and an even out for
[SPEAKER_00]: all that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we kind of go in between that with
too many maybe circulation fans or other
[SPEAKER_00]: things in some of these setups,
we could cause the opposite reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's always just good to be
mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I always say to people
is that it's easier to add more fans if
[SPEAKER_00]: you think that you need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a bunch of fans and all of a
sudden you're like, well, maybe I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need this fan or this is too many fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to the podcast and now I
realize I've got too many fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easier to go to the store and
buy another fan and add one than it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sit around with a bunch of fans and go,
OK, now they're going on Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace or the next garage sale or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so starting out with a little bit and
adding more is the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about about too much cool,
too much cold, not enough heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for most of us, this isn't something
that we're going to experience during our
[SPEAKER_01]: the main part of our growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably something that is happening
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly there are people who are going
to have cold nights that they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: insulate from in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but for most people, it seems to be
the end of flowering when they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to squeeze out another week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the nights are have dropped below
or near 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're just trying to keep their
their plants awake and the soil away.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we don't want to close
up the greenhouse totally because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: also mold time of year and we don't want
them to to the plants that are molding to
[SPEAKER_01]: get other plants also molding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what suggestions do you make for
preserving that air exchange so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can keep the fresh air coming in without
making the plants too cold there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that that's definitely a tricky or
slippery slope in some cases, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I would also look
at going into those times years is is how
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm irrigating my water schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I might actually start to cut
back on the water a little bit as I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's starting to cool down because the
plants aren't going to use as much water
[SPEAKER_00]: as they start to cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're starting to finish,
it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though maybe there's the
idea of flushing, that doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it uses less water, less amounts of
water in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bringing in cold air isn't the
worst thing in the world, but it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of work in these do-it-yourself
greenhouses because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to put things on a timer or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, you know, we're we're
the sensor, you know, us as humans are the
[SPEAKER_00]: main sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go, hey, it feels warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, it feels cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, I think it's really
important to have that infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer so you can point and shoot and
see what your plant temps are,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say that, you know,
as you're getting closer to the finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants, knowing what those flower
temperatures are and making sure they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get too hot in the daytime and then
that temperature swing in the night gets
[SPEAKER_00]: too crazy where they get terribly cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what ends up happening
sometimes is it's almost like an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning condenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it starts to get that,
you know, on a hot day, that pipe starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to get frost built up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plants are kind of a condenser
in the same regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily get frost and
freeze around them or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they get hot and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get hot and cold,
they expire moisture or not in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to monitor where the
shift or where that change is and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to carry this
thing around all the time and monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually you start to get a little
bit of a groove going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you kind of get that Jedi
mindset with the plants and going,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I know it's going to happen on a day
like today, so I need to be prepared and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe close the greenhouse up a little
earlier than I normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for the opening of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I need to actually open the
greenhouse a little bit more on these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really understanding and looking
ahead at the weather patterns and then
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing what the cause and effect is
with some of that weather on those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, the temp and
humidity, you know, sensors are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even the basic pool ones that,
you know, you hang outside and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to hook it up to any electricity at
all are really good for telling us the
[SPEAKER_00]: temp and the humidity of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at the plant temp with
the laser and we go, oh, aha, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if things get warmer or
colder, this could be what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases, it might be just
turning off the fan or it might be just
[SPEAKER_00]: turning on the fan or it might be closing
the greenhouse, like I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: opening it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that it's best to always
do one little thing at a time rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: several things, because it's really easy
for us to get caught up in how we feel
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we feel isn't how the plants feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when we're walking
around in socks and shoes and hats and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves and pants and all these things,
what we're feeling isn't really how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not an apples to apples situation
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always kind of laugh when people
go into a grow room or a greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: go, oh, it's really hot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's really this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are the plants experiencing that same,
you know, feeling or reaction that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting out of the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I say like monitor what
the plants is really doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil temp is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The substrate temp and knowing what that
is and being able to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not using freezing cold water towards the
end of that cycle and shocking the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: even more for the development of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be that we need to heat up
the water when we irrigate at that time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year and maybe nothing else matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you have to monitor all that
stuff so that you can really process
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to help make that decision of
what direction you're going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just because we read that some guy
does it on the Internet does not mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes it appropriate for where we live
and our goals and how our gear is set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always good to interpret these things
for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram has not helped the commercial
farmer one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like all I've seen is people go,
I saw this online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, that wasn't in your
state, your town and your climate or any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Instagram or social
media is a great place to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times people are only
showing the good stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, there's more to it
than the picture that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually more to it than even some
of the statements that we read about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they're important to learn and
to know about, people are really quick to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply or jump knee-jerk reaction to,
hey, this is what I want to do or,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is where we want to go,
this direction or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the commercial setting at scale,
it's taking people down the wrong road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so luckily with the home growers,
I think that there's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiveness here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it's money out of our pocket
when we're trying to grow and do these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, whether we're at scale or we're at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, the more things that
we can kind of monitor and keep an eye on,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better we have chances of making the
right pivot at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you know, I would take what you
learn on social media sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it's just a picture and a
quick statement with a grain of salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's way more to those stories
than what's being told.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the last area I want to ping
on here before we wrap up set two is
[SPEAKER_01]: insect pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you have a greenhouse,
you're kind of a host for a war,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all of the naturally occurring
beneficial insects that are just in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we've got a grassy floor,
certainly they are in the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are attracting beneficial
predators as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we are choosing to also do
order beneficial insects online from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody like, you know, natural enemies
or something, we're adding those to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we've got whatever pest
pressure that we have in the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, plus all the good guys in the
natural environment and anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're all within, you know,
these walls and it's like a cage match.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what has your experience been as far as
pest pressure being worse in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: and also pest solutions being potentially
easier in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how does this play out differently
in a greenhouse and what are your
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you brought up a couple of funny
points of the, yeah, I mean, it can be an
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing battle and it's definitely
something to be noteworthy of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say that, you know,
one of the best environments for a pest is
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pests will really take off in a
greenhouse just because it's the warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: spot than anywhere else on the property a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's another reason that,
well, let me say this too, is that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people come from the idea of controlled
environment agriculture or controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say that word all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a greenhouse is a little more
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hear that term a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be honest, I mean, even some of
the most sophisticated greenhouses out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, state of the art, are really hard
to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one hand, it's just because there's too
many bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, there's not enough
talent or people that know how to dial all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cannabis has taken greenhouses
further than any ag greenhouses ever gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are there people out there that
know how to dial these things in and make
[SPEAKER_00]: them work right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's far and few between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really better if people look
at things at a more practical aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my way of looking at things,
I want to create support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of controlled environment,
I want to have a supportive environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the stuff that we talked
about is already in that alignment of
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, naturally, how can we help the
plants and benefit growing them easier and
[SPEAKER_00]: without all these problems and without all
these bells and whistles?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I always say, use the word
support as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes to the greenhouses
and this pest issue that comes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely really can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been to a lot of greenhouses
that do get really hot and have adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pests really proliferate and do
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these greenhouses,
and especially these hot zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first order of business would
be knowing where your plants come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, if you're starting them from
seed at your own house, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more control over it than
if you were maybe bringing in clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are bringing in clones from
somewhere else, you really need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they're clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can take the jeweler's loop,
the microscopes, and really look the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants over from the leaves and the
underside and things like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if there's anything on them or
wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing would be to work
on a program of keeping them clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you did buy clones and they're
not clean, then that program of dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: them before you plant them or making sure
that you're using some type of pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management right off the bat so that you
don't wait until they become more
[SPEAKER_00]: infested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to nip it in the bud as soon as
possible is really the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes for the mom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making your own cuttings off
your own moms, you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your moms are as clean as possible so that
you start out as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you go into the greenhouse,
yeah, like you said, if you have a grass
[SPEAKER_00]: floor or we're in these greenhouses with
these open doors and side walls and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, sure, bugs can come flying in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that a lot of times when I've
talked over the years about opening the
[SPEAKER_00]: door or rolling up a side wall in a
greenhouse, it's like, well, the bugs can
[SPEAKER_00]: come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from what we've learned and seen
over the years, the bugs really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the weakest plant in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants that are not as healthy as
other plants typically will get the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will even say, oh,
I grow these three different cultivars in
[SPEAKER_00]: my greenhouse, but they only want to go to
the gelato or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the turps of the gelato more
than they like the OG or the lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato or something, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that might seem like the case,
but it's not totally the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it has to do with,
and again, plants can seem and look really
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, but when they have this bug
infestation, that's the first sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is something wrong with the health
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why aren't they going to the other
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the other plants are a little bit
stronger and more resistant to those bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that this strain or this
particular plant in the greenhouse is
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe is because of the
nutritional demands and the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate and things were made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we mixed up a pot and it was the
last of our bag of soil in our amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we kind of just didn't give that last
little plant everything that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we now know that it's getting all
the bugs because it just didn't meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: health demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't meet the demands of the
nutrition and everything that it was put
[SPEAKER_00]: up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that inside the
greenhouses, we always want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting in the corners because the
corners are typically warmer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun comes up in the morning,
it's usually directed to one end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the sun goes down,
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically you always want to look
on the outskirts or the ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses for the first infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will tell you a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, we're trying to avoid an
infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the program that you set up from
the early time is really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main part of that program,
I would say, is scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of people's first line
of defense is just, hey, I just spray my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants every couple of days no matter if I
have bugs or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that method is OK, but it's not the
best for the plants and the expressions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers and it can be hard on the plants
to spray them all the time with even
[SPEAKER_00]: organic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't love it, but they also don't
necessarily hate it a tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're trying to grow quality
medicine and trying to keep the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward every time we spray the
plants with those oils, it is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: setback for the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so scouting with the jeweler's loop
and just really being able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: where the pests are, how bad it is,
maybe gives you the ability to spot spray
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than entirely covering every plant
and soaking everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so identifying the hot spots or where
these things are, which pests they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and knowing the lifecycle of these pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times where we don't spray
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're spraying every seven days or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's just the idea that someone
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I spray every seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in between that time, how many eggs
have hatched and how many aphids even
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe have proliferated in that amount of
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're actually just kicking the
can down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that you brought up a good
company, Natural Enemies and Copert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have a lot of cool stuff as
far as pocket guides and jeweler's loops
[SPEAKER_00]: and books on these pests and posters that
you can hang in your garage or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room that help keep you on your toes
for all this pest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not scouting and using a
jeweler's loop and picking off leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the underside of them quite
often, I would say that when an
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation does pick up, I wouldn't be
surprised because you can actually find
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff pretty easy before things start
to get out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going in and de-leafing the plants
a little bit before you spray so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of some of those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that when you de-leaf your
plants, you always want to have a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage bag or some type of a garbage bag
with you so you're not just throwing those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's been common practice even
for me and I've seen it in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: level where when they go de-leaf,
everybody just de-leafs as fast as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can and all the leaves are hitting the
floor and on the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come back later and we maybe
sweep it all up or rake it all up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it into the garbage bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the pests start to
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit and you're not actually
getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by de-leafing the plants that maybe
have some bugs on them, we're getting rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of quite a few bugs because that's where
they reside is the underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine yourself throwing away
hundreds of pests by just de-leafing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then going in and doing the spray that
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the products I like to use is
Azagard, which is an Azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as much of a fan of the Azamax as
I am the Azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Azadirachtin, another product that
I like to use is called Sufoil X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a similar product to Sufoil X
called Tritec.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both 80% mineral oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's more expensive than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to just think and notice that
Sufoil X seems to be a better product at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you need to save a couple bucks and
go with the Tritec, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that mixing the Tritec and
the Azagard together can be a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: combo in fighting spider mites and aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to things like thrips,
like I was saying earlier, understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: the life cycle is really important because
the thrips also have one of the stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: life down in the soil or the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can spray all the thrips we
want, but if we don't treat the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're never going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting nematodes like the
Steinarima fatalea, if I said that right,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry if I botched it, is a good nematode
to put into the soil to help get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the thrips or even maybe avoid getting
some of those thrips in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being a home grower, sometimes
people don't want to know all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different ins and outs and details and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it's a really important
aspect to learn and to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get the hang of it and read
about it a little bit and know the common
[SPEAKER_00]: pests that you have and what to do about
them, it isn't that hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you don't know, things can
creep up and by the time they creep up and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to do their thing, it could be way
later in flower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a tough time to have to
spray and to begin battling pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the more we can do the moms,
the clones, and while they're in veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: even the earliest weeks of flowering will
help ensure that we have a great finish to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, that's so well put.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's interested in crisis
management for their pests when really the
[SPEAKER_01]: easy solution is on the prevention side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't happen in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right, so let's go ahead and take
our second commercial and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is OG Greenhouse Consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fish poop is extraordinarily complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are you adding the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium your plants need
[SPEAKER_01]: to build mass, transport nutrients,
and enhance flavor, but fish waste is also
[SPEAKER_01]: packed with biological activity and
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add fish poop to your irrigation
water, you are adding life force,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, and active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These microorganisms include a wealth of
various bacteria and protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: which further enhance nutrient
availability for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants are limited by the absence
of any essential micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop is a naturally complete solution
that fills in the cracks in your
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer program to ensure you offer
your garden a broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all fish poop is created equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most products with added fish waste don't
reveal their sources or lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fish poop, however,
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are even invited to tour their farm in
person or on their YouTube channel to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of transparency is wildly rare
in the fertilizer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks behind fish poop are also
lifelong medical cannabis producers who
[SPEAKER_01]: have deep connections in the community,
donate more product than they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and support cannabis prisoner,
veteran, and patient collectives and
[SPEAKER_01]: charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your bottle of pure fish poop,
go to fishpoop.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see their entire line of cannabis
products, go to ounceofhope.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fish poop brand fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the topics I want to share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaping Fire Instagram has follow up
posts to Shaping Fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_01]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_01]: personal grows everywhere, and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab, or for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to follow at Shaping
Fire and at Shango Los and join our online
[SPEAKER_01]: community on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you've caught up on the latest
Shaping Fire episodes, do you sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: wish there was more cannabis education
available to learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire has a fabulous YouTube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I attend conventions to speak or
moderate panels, I always record them and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the content home for you to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shango Los YouTube channel has
world-class speakers, including Zoe
[SPEAKER_01]: Sigmund's lecture, Understanding Your
Endocannabinoid System, Kevin Jodry of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland Nursery talking about breeding
cannabis for the best terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy Canole's Lost Art of the Hashishan
Presentation, Nicholas Mahmood on
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative and polyculture cannabis
growing, Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis medicine around the world,
Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless extraction, and Jeff Lowenfels
on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_01]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part Shaping Fire session series,
[SPEAKER_01]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo, and one with Jeff Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to youtube.com forward slash shango
los or click on the link in the Welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is OG greenhouse consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric Branstad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our big finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we figured out where
we were gonna put the greenhouse and how
[SPEAKER_01]: we were gonna put the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: During set two, we figured out how the
hell we're gonna deal with heat and cold
[SPEAKER_01]: and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here in set three, we're gonna talk a
little bit about tricking out our
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and proper care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Eric, you've been on this show before,
and we have talked at length about light
[SPEAKER_01]: deprivation, light dep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably know the episode number,
but for anybody who wants to listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: that episode, I'll put the link on the
page for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why don't you explain just real quick
what light dep is for folks who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with it for their home
greenhouse, and they can go to that
[SPEAKER_01]: episode if they want to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cannabis is a photo period plant,
and what we mean by that is that it uses
[SPEAKER_00]: these light cycles in order to grow or to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people are familiar with
indoor growing and the fact that 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light makes the plants veg or grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you cut that light back to
just 12 hours of light, they will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we want to do that same
technique outside, we can't turn on off
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun, but we can put a tarp over the
greenhouse that puts that greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we're using a greenhouse
with light dep curtains or tarps that
[SPEAKER_00]: create that photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have full control of when they
flower and when they veg using the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you know what I just realized?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just looked up while you were saying
that, the episode that you were on talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about light dep, you and I are recording
episode 119 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that episode, episode 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy mackerel, that was a bit ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
Number 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's still a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just still a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thank you for that definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dear listener, if you want to hear a
really good hour and a half about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this in detail, go on back to episode
13 and listen to Eric and I as youngins.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a quick little plug for light
dep, because if you are trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: self-sufficient with your cannabis and you
want to be able to maybe get into cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: during your summer, light dep is a great
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives light dep a short shrift,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I personally
really enjoyed was adding some Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental gauges to the tent outside
and it just is close enough to the house
[SPEAKER_01]: Wi-Fi to pick it up, which means that it
can then throw it to my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can be anywhere in the world and know
what's going on in my greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: because mostly I grow food here and food
and cannabis are all very temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can set my alarms and they can
bring me on in to tell me that I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: check on the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, at the home grower level
outdoors, there's not usually a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: integration of these sorts of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my gosh, they're really helpful if you
bother to spend a little coin and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not out of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot more out there than
there used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's little companies that
people barely know exist that have some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this technology going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting a couple of sensors in the
greenhouse that can be hooked up to your
[SPEAKER_00]: phone just to know what's going on
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pivotal parts of the year might be
in the spring and the fall when the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons are starting to change and you
really want to know what's going on so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can prepare to make some changes
or prepare to go home and do something
[SPEAKER_00]: about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's like you were saying,
it's not 100% needed and it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: always do everything that maybe an
automated greenhouse is going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does give you an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having that slight edge is always a
step forward in the right direction to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to rescue your own crop or enhance
the quality of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, with the way the weather
is these days, things can change pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be where you're away from
home and you need someone to go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: close it up because all of a sudden it got
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've had crazy weather where it's
sunny one day and the next day all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden we get a snowstorm or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody knows and sees this stuff
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we look at the weather and the
weatherman says it's going to be great,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not always right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really good to be able to
notice some of these things and stay ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that can be cool and
important to have is that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things can be hooked up to even a solenoid
that turns on and off your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be just a simple,
hey, I want to be able to turn on and off
[SPEAKER_00]: my water when I'm gone from home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not out of the question because
a lot of the landscaping stuff that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays for our homes can be outfitted to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainbird is a common company or term that
have all sorts of landscaping devices that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be remote or controlled just right at
your house type of thing with a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: buttons or even a timer on there that
allows you to be able to control when
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff gets water or maybe when a fan turns
on or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply hooking stuff up to a timer because
you know when you want something to come
[SPEAKER_00]: on or turn off can be an important way to
do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never hurts to, if you can,
throw in a little technology in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it helps you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your point, too, about you only
need to go into this as far as you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my food plants, which are mostly
un-greenhoused.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that are greenhouse,
I just need something really simple to
[SPEAKER_01]: know what the temperature and the humidity
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got just a simple little Govee
smart temperature thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost me like $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with my cannabis, I take it very much
more seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious for obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know heat and humidity and vapor
and all this more detailed stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be able to look at charts
and graphs of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for my cannabis greenhouse,
I've upgraded to a pulse system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I've got all the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, as you were saying, I haven't gone
so far as to connect it to my drip
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation, which would be dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whenever I want to, I could expand my
pulse meter into controlling all of my
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just take these steps one at a
time from season to season, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what you can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, and you're hitting
that same nail on the head, is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: start out simple and with what you can
afford and what seems reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and always have that ability to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the expanding can be adding another
light, adding another fan, or adding
[SPEAKER_00]: something to that control system,
which might be, OK, I've been reading and
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to add something where I can
turn it on and off myself or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there are, especially with that
pulse and a couple other systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to phase this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phase one, simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase two might be, once you get your feet
wet in the growing season, you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: more on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more bandwidth even for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always try to, like I said,
recommend starting out slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can within your own bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that season, look at what
the upgrades might look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were talking about upgrades and
upgrades around tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about adding lights to extend
the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think that adding lights to an
indoor space is an obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to a greenhouse is generally a good
idea, though I'm not a big fan of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light pollution that comes from people who
run their lights all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have more concern when we're talking
about these small hobby greenhouses of
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging lights in them, primarily for two
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, lights are heavy, and the
internal frames of these greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the galvanized steel ones,
they wiggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not so sure about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second, the light lights
themselves can generate heat and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially melt the plastic, just
because, again, we're not working with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of space here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have seen people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them do it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes their height from 6'6 to more
like 5'10, which is space I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are your thoughts on adding
lights to a greenhouse that's this small?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things that you said are
definitely noteworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each hobby house is a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can imagine we're going to hang lights
in something, and then we put it up and we
[SPEAKER_00]: run into some of these one step backwards
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen where people have taken
and basically taken a four by four post
[SPEAKER_00]: and augured or put that into the ground at
four corners or even just one at both
[SPEAKER_00]: ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually run a cable or a pole of
some kind and they actually hang the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights from that so it's not attached to
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came up years ago because when they
started doing Proposition 64 in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and rolling out the ordinances for how
people could grow, they were kind of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either were a permitted greenhouse and
commercially growing or because an ag you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow with a non-exempt or a
non-permitted greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cannabis farmers wanted to have
that same opportunity, but the ordinances
[SPEAKER_00]: were, hey, you got to have a permit or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they said,
well, if you want to have an exempt
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse that isn't permitted,
it can't have any electricity or lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: fastened to it, fans or any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what people started doing was
rigging up with four by four posts and
[SPEAKER_00]: internal framing so that they could hang
their fans and hang their lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't attached to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally outside the spirit of the rules,
but exactly how we cannabis people
[SPEAKER_01]: interpret rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to Home Depot these days,
and so when we're talking about lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: a deeper dive would be what kind of light,
what color, what intensity and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the short side of that or the
easier way to look at it might be that,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I'm just trying to veg my plants a
little longer, or hey, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them sooner or whatever the case
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get away with fairly low
powered lights in order to keep a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: one stage or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily mean that they're
going to grow bigger and faster and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce bigger buds, but it's definitely
going to help keep the cycle that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: intending streamlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a certain amount of time, and that's
where the lights could come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might say, and people have done
this even on the commercial side,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they go to Home Depot and they sell
the decorative outdoor patio lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically like a long extension
cord with some light bulbs hanging on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people would put that in their
patio or their backyard for barbecuing and
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and making more of an ambiance
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these same 40-foot string of lights
that they have in a box at Home Depot can
[SPEAKER_00]: be strung up inside these greenhouses,
maybe even without any framing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're fairly can be lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not saying that they're light
enough for all these frames, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter than hanging an LED or a HPS light
that you might go get at the grow store.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, they run a lot less hot,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do run a lot less hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something like those string lights
can be a great way to say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring my plants out whatever
time of the year, and I want to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: this veg cycle, and I don't want them to
trigger into flowering by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the opposite might be that you want
them to trigger into flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're just not getting enough
sunlight in some cases or whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This supplemental light is exactly what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supplementing some light in order to
keep those plants in the stage that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: intending without trying to rely on them
for ultimately all the growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: production that's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more topic I want to mention
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to discuss it, but I just
want to throw this out there for the one
[SPEAKER_01]: person who needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to live in a place with a
very short cultivation season,
[SPEAKER_01]: like where I am in Washington state,
you can also consider something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned from an OG black market grower in
Port Townsend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening, man, I would love to
see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made raised beds and he put in heaters
in the soil because one of the problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that we run into is that after the
evenings start to get under 50 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: the containers go to sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of your microbe light falls asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells the roots were done,
and so the plants finish up and start to
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would trick out his tents with the
lights, and then he would also put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: warmed beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was growing outdoors and harvesting
first week in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Washington, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that he was able to go until the
snow started to be too heavy on his hoop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he had to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to be in one of those places
where the season is cold and you are in
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, there's an idea for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to bring that up earlier and I
just moved through things and forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiant heat is really important for
production going into those colder months
[SPEAKER_00]: or parts of the areas of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime that you have your substrate start
to go below even 60 degrees, like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, everything starts to hibernate and
slows down progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our soil temps to be 69 to 70
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also means we don't want to use
freezing cold water to irrigate with when
[SPEAKER_00]: we do go irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not advocating hot water, but I am
advocating something that's temperate and
[SPEAKER_00]: not straight out of the ground at 40 or 50
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get your water closer to 70,
it doesn't have to be hot because hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water will actually start to grow bad
things and cause problems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to avoid the freezing cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that people have done is
they've maybe wrapped their beds or even
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow pots in some type of
insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most low cost effective might be straw
mulch even that they wrap around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other people that you're familiar
with, hash makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll wrap their washing machine with
that mylar looking bubble wrap stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: is insulative and it can get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff chopped up and wrapped
around your pots or your beds in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with the idea of adding some
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some radiant heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideas and companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I always throw these selfless
plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not connected to any of these
companies usually, but we plug them
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company I think in the Midwest
called Radiant Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's radiant T-E-C at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiant Tech has a lot of do-it-yourself
supplies for creating a radiant heating
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another company that's more
commercial, but I think they do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby kits now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good people called BioTherm in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioTherm also provides radiant heat
systems for commercial greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have something on the hobby
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering extending the
seasons, if you're considering growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter, or if you're growing in a
place where you guys have the really short
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons, some of these things can be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not all of them, at least one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be not irrigating with the
freezing cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't pull it up from your well and put it
right on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to want to bathe in that,
so neither are they.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last topic I want us to touch on,
Eric, you have told me so many times to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that I put away my greenhouse
skin properly because they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't clean it before I put it away,
it's going to get crappy over the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I did not listen to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I screwed up all my stuff, so I had to
replace the plastics the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going forward, I now listen to you and I
make sure I wash down the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: let it dry, and fold it up before the
weather gets too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that there is some general
upkeep that should probably be done on
[SPEAKER_01]: these greenhouse skins over the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's a plastic
conditioner or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they should be put away correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you give us your little best thoughts
on taking care of the greenhouse and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to properly put it away for the season?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little soap and water goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you were to look online of
somebody like Greenhouse Megastore or
[SPEAKER_00]: Griffin Greenhouse and maybe even a
company in Santa Barbara called Total
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy Group, Total Energy Group sells a
lot of whitewash materials so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: add a lot of greenhouses in the summertime
that don't have an automated shade cloth
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that will spray a
whitewash type of a paint on the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically calms down the sun's
intensity because it takes away some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it washes off in the wintertime or
when it rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies like that might sell a
conditioner of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that in a lot of areas of
cannabis growing, I've gone out and seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is quite a bit of particulate
that settles on these greenhouse frames,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's dust or environmental stuff,
pine needles or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not out of the question to go out
there once a week, once a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just hose the greenhouse down with a
hose so that you get some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes to wintertime,
like you were saying, is taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It not only protects the skin,
it protects the frame because as you were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying earlier, if we get a tremendous
amount of rain, it can build up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in these little pockets and
saggy spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it snows, that snow load will take down
the greenhouse frame and so will the rain
[SPEAKER_00]: if it gets enough water trapped on top of
it in weird places.
[SPEAKER_00]: By taking the greenhouse cover off,
we're avoiding the frame collapsing or
[SPEAKER_00]: bending or creating any stress on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's also going to make that cover
last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the mistakes people do is they'll
just fold it up and stick it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ends up happening is for some reason,
I don't know what it is, but mice just
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be attracted to plastic and weird
things like this and they bore a hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of it when it's folded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you go unfold it, it's like a
piece of Swiss cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that piece of plastic rolled up and
maybe put into a cardboard box simply is
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, the mice don't always
bore through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, but for some reason,
they tend to leave stuff alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a black and yellow tote and
fit it inside of that, that might even be
[SPEAKER_00]: a better solution for really keeping
anything out and bugs and rodents that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never recommend using any kind of
rodent killer or spray or anything because
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the products or chemicals in
those products can be bioaccumulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cause a test fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, soap and water, letting it
dry, folding it up, putting it in a box or
[SPEAKER_00]: a black and yellow tote of some kind and
stick it in the garage, maybe somewhere up
[SPEAKER_00]: high or easy to keep away from the kids
and the animals and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your greenhouse cover is going to last way
longer than probably even the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of experience I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of throwing it in a black and
yellow tote is so obvious and I missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually run into the rat problems
that you've got with them eating through
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine are actually suspended from rope from
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like your idea of putting it in
the black and white a lot better because,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it doesn't look as weird,
but also it won't go through all the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature changes as the ambient air in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Eric, let's wrap up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining me again on
Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always enjoyed your professionalism
and your depth of knowledge, but I also
[SPEAKER_01]: really enjoy it because you're a good
conversationalist and you're just fun to
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we got an opportunity to hang out
for a couple of hours today with everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just chat and hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's always good chatting with
you and I miss hanging with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to dust you off and
get you out here to want something one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these days so we can hang out again,
but it's got to be the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that comes up, I'll be calling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, I miss because it used to be,
at the very least, you and I saw each
[SPEAKER_01]: other at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to diss Emerald Cup because I
know you're still heavy there as a judge,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Emerald Cup has changed and it just
doesn't bring all the people that it used
[SPEAKER_01]: to and I miss that old family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed a lot and yeah, I miss a lot
of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the same and there's
some other events out there that are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like that, but yeah, it's all changed
and the events are all different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one of these days something's going to
happen and we're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we'll be at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will see you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the Wonderland days were
great too for meeting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss the Wonderland days and some of
those spring kickoffs and things that
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin used to throw up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just don't want to travel like they
used to, especially a lot of the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most popular event or one of
the more popular NorCal events nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: that just happened is the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been, but it seems to be the
new community event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that these specialty,
very small, ultra high quality events is
[SPEAKER_01]: where it is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see the return of a big event,
but it would have to take a very
[SPEAKER_01]: particular promoter to pull it off so that
it doesn't get usurped as much by the
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity advertising and turn it into
what everything else is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely support such an event
if it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's always good catching up with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good catching up with you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's plug some of your stuff.
