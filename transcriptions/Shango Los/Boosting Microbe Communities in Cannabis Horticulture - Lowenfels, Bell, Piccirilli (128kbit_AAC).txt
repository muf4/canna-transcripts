[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and read his bio anyway,
just so it's on the video, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, welcome to the 130 panel on
micro life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Shango Lowe, host of the Shaping Fire
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you love hearing excellent information
from cannabis experts, I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_03]: check out shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where my podcast lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Lowenfels has been on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that fantastic show to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we've got a blossoming YouTube
channel now that's serving over a half
[SPEAKER_03]: million minutes of exclusive cannabis
content that I recorded at conventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on our micro panel today is Jeff
Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a reformed lawyer and author of the
award winning and bestselling books
[SPEAKER_03]: Teaming with Microbes, The Organic
Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web,
[SPEAKER_03]: Teaming with Nutrients, The Organic
Gardener's Guide to Optimizing Plant
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrition, and his third book in the Soil
Trilogy, Teaming with Fungi, The Organic
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers Guide to Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff also writes the longest running
gardening column in North America,
[SPEAKER_03]: having never missed a week in 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 44.
[SPEAKER_03]: 44.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote this a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you're clapping, in 2005,
he was inducted into the Garden Writers
[SPEAKER_03]: Hall of Fame, the highest honor a garden
writer can attain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with him is John Picciarelli.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is founder of Cutting Edge Solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an early adopter of the soil food web
system, his business is rooted in
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: John helped develop the Cutting Edge
product line to support natural soil
[SPEAKER_03]: ecology, including their flagship product,
Humtea, and co-founded a microbiology lab
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2004 to support their research efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of John's current side projects I love
is growing milkweed and a variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen producing flowers for migrating
monarch butterflies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's assume that Colin's going to join
us, and we'll plug him too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin Bell is the co-founder, co-inventor,
and chief growth officer at Grossentia,
[SPEAKER_03]: the parent company of mammoth microbes,
which is probably where you've heard of
[SPEAKER_03]: him before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009 as a researcher and
[SPEAKER_03]: scientist at Colorado State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin published dozens of peer-reviewed
publications that were focused on
[SPEAKER_03]: microbial mediated processes that enhance
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin left his academic position in March
of 2015 to launch Grossentia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their first product, mammoth pea,
is a beneficial bacterial bloom stimulant
[SPEAKER_03]: that targets phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way that we're going to do the
panel today is we're going to present the
[SPEAKER_03]: panel a question, and then each panelist
will have a chance to take a swing at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the panel is only 45
minutes, so we're going to be moving along
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty swiftly, and we may or may not have
time for questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, let's go ahead and start with you
since you're closest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, in a commercial growing
operation, conservation of resources,
[SPEAKER_03]: including time and money, is vital,
and changing from traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growing techniques consisting of bottled
salt nutrients to instead using holistic
[SPEAKER_03]: growing techniques that bring the soil
alive can seem differently expensive in
[SPEAKER_03]: time, training, and changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Management often resists making the switch
to living soil because they're afraid of
[SPEAKER_03]: the risk involved with doing something
that they say differently that is
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can focusing on building thriving micro
communities in commercial operations be
[SPEAKER_03]: financially beneficial in addition to just
being natural?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I say that because I think we're
about to see the biggest change our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry's seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to be seeing beer
companies and tobacco companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the big pharma companies come in
and grow stuff, and we know that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow stuff the way they make
cigarettes and the way they make beer and
[SPEAKER_02]: the way they may do everything else they
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be a natural system,
and the way that you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to distinguish yourself from them,
I believe, is because you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: organic and natural and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those early articles in California that
one out of five plants didn't make it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the testing, etc., etc., you know,
you're going to be the positive side of
[SPEAKER_02]: that story, and so I think definitely is
going to be worth it from an economic
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective regardless of whether you
believe in it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts, John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's a good point in
that, you know, sustainability means you
[SPEAKER_00]: can save soil, and so by reusing soil,
I mean, that's one of the key factors in
[SPEAKER_00]: labor and, you know, wasting time,
wasting money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as far as salt-based fertilizers
go, I mean, that means pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in a bottle because if you
think about it, seaweed is a salt-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt-based means that it's on the SI or
salt index, and the salt index is made out
[SPEAKER_00]: of sodium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sodium nitrate actually is an organic
fertilizer, so it gets kind of confusing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you say salt-based, but there's a lot
of people that are going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments and going back to compost teas,
and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that Jeff's point that by
differentiating yourself as somebody who's
[SPEAKER_03]: growing with living soil probiotically,
I mean, it's a huge marketing win for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a product differentiator that you're
not going to find just anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I know what Colin would have
said to this question as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin would have also said that it is a
misnomer that using living soils and
[SPEAKER_03]: building healthy microbe communities is
less yielding, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Historically, people think that,
oh, you have to use bottled nutrients in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to get these monster yields,
but what we're finding is that as we
[SPEAKER_03]: relearn how to take care of our soil,
yields are increasing and are being as
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive as with these traditional
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So John, this next question is for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much of the market for flour is based
on bag appeal, and many consider frosty
[SPEAKER_03]: flours and intense coloration to be the
result of intense synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can commercial-scale growers do to
create frosty flours with great bag appeal
[SPEAKER_03]: while also respecting the health of
substrate microbe communities?
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught like half of that question as I
was watching Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think I can just work off
what I think that question is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when you say bag appeal,
of course, everyone is looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, frosty flours and the terpene
levels being boosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as a fertilizer
manufacturer, I mean, probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing is manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, manganese is a key micronutrient
that all plants need, and they'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, take it and turn it into an
enzyme that acts as a catalyst and moves
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the ECA family where there's hops
and cannabis and pot, basically cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, the manganese is even more
an important role as the basis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes being made with the early blocks,
building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get more manganese in there
when manganese is only available in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: at like a pH of four?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the way to do that is
microbial breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we actually have a product
that we use microbes to break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbes play a key role in,
you know, being able to build a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, mammoth pea has some good
bacteria in it that also make phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you don't want to overload
your soil with too much phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much bone meal, or, you know,
even too much, you know, using products
[SPEAKER_00]: that have phosphoric acid in them because
they'll shut down mycorrhizal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's another benefit of
using microbes that make, like bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: megateria or pseudomonas puduta that make,
will make more of the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorus, of course, you know,
adds to the flower structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, then there's a whole
different school of thought out there now,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that, there's already a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's hold questions to the end in
case we have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, as far as getting the
flowers more frosty, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of different fungi and
bacteria that produce amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have an amino acid
product that kind of mimics that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that boosts the actual structure of
the glands and swells them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get more crystals on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as far as building a good
flower structure, you're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as building good overall look and
terpenes, you know, once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at microbes processing
elements such as manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then foliar spraying, a lot of people
do that with hum tea or compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they find that that actually
influences the plant and gives it more
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and more crystal structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I built a lab and I've
worked for over 20 years in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not like a one minute question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Collin could probably explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collin, welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question that we ask when you're
running in is can using microbe
[SPEAKER_03]: communities and living soil create flowers
that have got the bag appeal and are sexy
[SPEAKER_03]: and will compete with the kind of stuff we
see from synthetics and petroleum
[SPEAKER_03]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know, there's
interactions with all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of solutions that we
have to bring together to achieve our
[SPEAKER_01]: final goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final goal is quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think these quality metrics is bag
appeal is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really my personal metric for
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the quality of the terpenes and maybe
the chemists with situants and that smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that flavor that translates from the
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that terpene flavor or the terpene
smell to translate to that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's even a more sophisticated
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sure there's THC and CBD and other
cheminoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we know that there's these
interactions with all these terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: helps enhance the effect how this flower
makes us feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, you know, tested and looked at a lot
of different strains where the CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_01]: is the same, but they have completely
different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all this chemical interactions
which contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we make that full package?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by what John said, maximizing the
plant's ability to take up the resources
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to maximize its full phenotypic
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to a large degree,
we have to make sure the nutrients are
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to make sure the
nutrients are bioavailable and that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can be taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's an interaction with
maximizing our plant genetics and our
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we're talking about is the
inputs and the availability of these
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And availability to a large degree is a
microbial function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maximizing the plant's ability to open up
and I got out of breath running,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran from way across the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick pass it to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to maximize your plant's
ability to develop through the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the microbes, just like John
was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean the microbes are what take
the organic materials and convert them
[SPEAKER_02]: into an available substrate that the plant
can take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important for everybody
to understand the plant uses 17 nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put a terpene down in the soil
and expect that terpene to go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and come up out and be a crystal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each plant cell produces what it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those tricones are producing the terpenes
and then making the crystal and putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's happening inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you have to do is give the plant,
as both these gentlemen have said,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything they possibly need in order to
make that little factory operate properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have a boycott with China over
the tariff or phosphorus because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to end up with the right kind of
beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to make sure that you've got
everything in the soil that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two other things I think you have to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to worry about genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should say three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to worry because if you don't
have great genetics, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get great terpes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the genetics of the plant,
which I think you said when you said
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have great sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to have great light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have the very best possible
light, then the factory's not operating at
[SPEAKER_02]: its optimum thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I guess the other thing you have to
have is gentleness because they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: these little crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many people who are doing hydroponic
come in and shake the plants and do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be careful and gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the last thing I'll say is I think
we've got to do a lot more research,
[SPEAKER_02]: not on a microbial level, but on a
cellular level and on an insect UV light
[SPEAKER_02]: level because it's pretty clear that UV
light is one of the things that causes
[SPEAKER_02]: these trichomes to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's figure out what spectrum,
where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we alter it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we change it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a special time to have one kind
of UV light over another?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's as important as the
microbial stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin, this next one is for you to go
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Establishing a commercial operation can
seem like a long-term project,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is, but at some point, cultivators
who want to make the switch to probiotic
[SPEAKER_03]: growing techniques have to make the jump
and get up to high yields and repeatable
[SPEAKER_03]: results fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What advice would you give to a
professional cultivator ready to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: switch to living soils so they quickly
achieve a baseline of production that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can refine over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to refer this to right to
living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just solutions, what I think,
I'm just going to talk about how I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: A jump from a hydroponic grower,
let's just have the full extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hydroponic, full hydroponic grower to a
living soil grower, that's a heck of a
[SPEAKER_01]: jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's a quick path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's stair-stepping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding the steps of moving that
direction and having this angle of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what we want to look like, and these are
the kind of things that we need to start
[SPEAKER_01]: adopting and practicing in our grow and
getting those results and stair-stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: over to that full organic living soil
cultivation is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I've been, this has been a
really fun week, and kind of reflecting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two weeks, I was in a bunch of
huge grows in California in the Salinas
[SPEAKER_01]: area, really, really high throughput,
acre-sized greenhouses, a full bore,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the last week I spent with a
bunch of growers and farms, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: humbled, where it's a lot smaller scale,
living soil, the hugel growing and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this type of stuff, so it's very
fascinating to take all that information
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of synthesize it and understand
how does the humble, hugel, living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: type of grow get scaled into a high
throughput manufacturing or cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think speed is realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think consistency and having clear
benchmarks and a clear goal of how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: there is the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of that is understanding the
different components that get us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's this substrate
component, there's this input-based
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient component, and then there's this
microbial and living soil components,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we might not get all the way there,
but I think I would encourage facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: that are huge in our commercial scale and
are looking at really high throughput,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to them, as they're getting
from point A of where they are right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa and synthetics to organics and
microbials and other inputs and living
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, they're gonna find the solutions
that work best for their current practices
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can plug in and then take the
next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the big steps, and I'll
leave it up to the other guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the facilities that I visited,
big facility, had the synthetic cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the normal stuff, and then their biggest
challenge was organic substrate to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in, and you wouldn't think this,
they're adding the microbes, they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the things right, but what they're getting
challenged with, and it's really intuitive
[SPEAKER_01]: if you just kind of acknowledge it,
is the drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you start to get this organic
living soil in a pot or in a container,
[SPEAKER_01]: it compacts and does something,
and the hydrology is very different than a
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, and that was one of their biggest
challenges, so understanding how to scale
[SPEAKER_01]: every aspect of those inputs to get to
this end goal, whatever kind of scale of
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil they can achieve with their
infrastructure is the goal, and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think that greenhouse is gonna grow like
the growers in Humboldt, but I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can achieve to the best of their
ability natural inputs to get organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality end product using natural
solutions, and a lot of those are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the farm in Humboldt, the growers are
trying to get all their inputs from their
[SPEAKER_01]: land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna happen at these
commercial facilities, so finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: other sources for those inputs is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said hugel, so that means they're
cutting down trees and putting them into a
...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, have you heard of this before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built these things before,
and it's kind of interesting because it
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the tree you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can select cedar, bad choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black locust, forget black locust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not break down either,
but fir breaks down pretty well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some people actually grow in redwood
sawdust, and there's substrates that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different companies that
use redwood sawdust as their base,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they kind of do that for a number of
reasons, but one of them is because if
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa core all comes from one or two
sources, and it's all treated with calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, so you can never get an organic
certification on cocoa core unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with a specific company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Royal Gold, I think, has an organic
cocoa core, but I mean, they're a large
[SPEAKER_00]: company, but in the scheme of things,
they're very small, and they're also in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, but that hugel stuff is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone here has seen this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's seen this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand if you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow, that's way more people than I
thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody wants to see these drawn out,
I actually visited the same farm that
[SPEAKER_03]: Cullen went to at Moon Time Medicinals,
and it's got pictures of their 6,500
[SPEAKER_03]: square feet of hugelkultur in Garberville,
and you can see it on the shaping fire
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to you, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question we were working on was
making the switch from synthetics to
[SPEAKER_03]: probiotics, and what would you recommend
for somebody wanting to move in that
[SPEAKER_03]: direction, trying to take their company in
that direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because they're straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to look at it as being
indoor, greenhouse, or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do a hugel structure
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen investors buy anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say cannabis enough times,
and they're throwing money down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, hugel, even that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic, oh, I've got to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a greenhouse, it's more
challenging, because you have to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: height, of course, and then you have to
have the airflow, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mounds tend to trap a lot of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoors, you are actually seeing it
being used outdoors more.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take the steps, it's kind of
interesting, because this whole industry
[SPEAKER_00]: is changing so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was talking to this chemical
engineer and a PhD chemist that used to
[SPEAKER_00]: work for Novartis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in Willets, and they clean oil
for $2 to $3 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the first people that I've
actually seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about their process,
because I said I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can do it, and they can end up
with a clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big issue, because in
Salinas, they're worried about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you, but when I go down
there, I get a headache after two days,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they spray so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real challenge with the surrounding
agriculture, in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you almost have to have wet walls to
trap a lot of the vapors coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, that builds humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your question, though, was how do you
step from some pure rock-able hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: setup to ultimately having living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Colin said, if you've read Jeff's
books, you realize that that's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's either a complete commitment,
and you pretty much have to own the
[SPEAKER_00]: property at that point, because the
overhead will kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make those different steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbiology is with you every one of
those steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: In liquid form, you have mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff talks a lot about compost tees.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that are going to
help your plant along and sustain your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as you test out these different
substrates and ultimately try to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: an amended soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to end up foliar spraying
quite a bit to keep the plant going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I could probably lay out the
answer by describing a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how much time we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I go on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still doing pretty well on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an interesting dude, so just let it
ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so you were in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Humboldt has always been a place with
a lot of experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a ranch there in Willow Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm right in there with all the
experimenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started experimenting in 1978
when I was a kid and grew my first
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen a lot of growers succeed,
fail, or just go on and do other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbiology was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Humboldt and Mendocino,
they have the advantage of being in there
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, attracting all the
helicopters, which push their cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the edges of the woods where all
the microbiology was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, things coming off lichen and other
plants interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where I got my
education was, as a kid, digging holes,
[SPEAKER_00]: using a flower sifter to add the
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't want to get hit over the
head with the shovel for doing the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gradually, I got really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to work at a lot of different
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized I had to go back to school
to study microbiology, because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: more going on than just fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led me to actually looking at
other plants and other plant compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are products out there now that
are almost like homeopathic products,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just small amounts of certain other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a whole bio-stimulation
formula line available commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's plants from Southeast Asia and
North America and a couple plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're harvested at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have different compounds in them
that influence the plant in making roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, blooming, and then, of course,
boosting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from John Jevons and Chad
Wick, who brought double digging to this
[SPEAKER_00]: country from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're giving the thumbs down on Chad
Wick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double digging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Jeff now about double digging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard this myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: It destroys the mycorrhizal network.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad for the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double digging once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, you've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's an outlawed concept in my mind,
particularly when you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to double dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually learned that from,
like, my girlfriend forced me to farm with
[SPEAKER_00]: draft horses for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I would do anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't want to be in his bed in the
night.
You're using horses.
Oh, sorry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was whipped into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
You know, working with draft horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I learned about the
degradation of the ozone layer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that fungi was being destroyed by
flipping the soil too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, in like 1990,
I was growing quinoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know, ripping the soil
with a D7 cat was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm learning from old
farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, you know, that this is how
you do it out here in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lassen County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started looking at more soil
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized under my scope,
I'm like, wow, there's less fungi than if
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go to the outside of the field
where it's undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then I realized I had to do
more fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, this is going to cost
me money deeply ripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked around, I realized why
they were all going out of business and
[SPEAKER_00]: why I could have an organic farm there
because they couldn't afford their own
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just proved that, in fact,
you can go commercial from organic from
[SPEAKER_02]: non-sympathetic.
So you did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a roundabout way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do it in a slightly different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, given where we are today,
I'm just looking out in the audience,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would start with something like key
to life or I use bio-natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a system that's in place that's got
four or five or six different inputs,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Five.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have up to 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to 16 inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of these can be used,
and I don't mean to pick on these,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you just throw other people out here,
organic as well as inorganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use them in a hydro system and
a soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're starting to make that
conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can understand what's going on,
what's working, what's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you work on the substrate,
which is what you've mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you convert into a soil substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done, and it's not that
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got enough money, you hire a
converter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hire a consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you start with a base, somebody's
system that you know works and that's got
[SPEAKER_02]: some scientific background that you can
read on and be able to tweak and think
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say, okay, now I've got this
system that's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's fool around a little bit with
mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you add that into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, frankly, and I think
you guys will all agree, you don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: even need to add the stuff in anymore once
you get your system working and it's alive
[SPEAKER_02]: and you've made the conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easy to do for individuals,
small people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less easy for bigger people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a system that's based on
known, works either hydro, which I
[SPEAKER_02]: consider to be synthetic, obviously,
and works soil, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can start really tweaking that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you got to really do if
you want to make that conversion in any
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of economic speedy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the inputs are concerned,
while you're making that conversion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start looking around for where there
are good inputs and who's not using what
[SPEAKER_02]: waste product that you can use that
they're not using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's there a grow where somebody's
inadvertently or stupidly throwing away
[SPEAKER_02]: their soil after every grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's ways to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody wants to help you because
everybody wants a little bit of your
[SPEAKER_02]: organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sets us up for this next question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this time, we'll go Colin John.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll finish up with you,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this applies for both home growers and
patients and also for commercial folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we all know, you need to be
choosy about which products you purchase
[SPEAKER_03]: because some of these products can be
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you recommend as being a few
inputs that can be grown either simply at
[SPEAKER_03]: home or larger at a commercial site?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at a commercial scale that can be grown
and add high quality inputs to a probiotic
[SPEAKER_03]: soil in order to help keep costs down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we wouldn't have started with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably need to reflect on this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
I'm good.
Are you?
Yeah.
I'm prepared now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you catch your breath?
[SPEAKER_01]: You really came in running hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it comes down to me is chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the day,
I think about everything as a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the papers I did in science,
I have a background in research sciences
[SPEAKER_01]: from Colorado State University,
a PhD in microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was doing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really fascinated not only with
plant-microbe interactions, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient stoichiometry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all have a seed and a P to K
ratio in our bodies, so do plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: so do microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the things that we're trying
to fulfill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eat food because we're trying to
fulfill our internal stoichiometry,
[SPEAKER_01]: our nutrient demands, our nutrient needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to do with a
fertility program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to deliver the nutrients that
the plants need so they can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: uninhibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thinking about these inputs,
what you want to think about them is at a
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemical level, the nutrient profile
level, and you grow those things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for example, alfalfa is a really
good example as a legume where it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporates more nitrogen into its
biomass because of the way it fixes that
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so forage alfalfa is a really good
example of a relatively higher nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: input.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to think about these aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually test forage or test
other, you know, any kind of input for its
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you're selecting these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think thinking about that,
thinking about the scale that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and all these things going into
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally what I would say is if you
don't know what's in it, you can't use it
[SPEAKER_01]: with precision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any microbe, the function, any of these
inputs, you have to identify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we understand what it is,
we can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it with confidence and precision and
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the Humboldt example,
I mean experiment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment in your own gardens,
on your own farm, but keep a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times people just
broadcast completely and then of course
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, oh, well, it didn't work that
well on this control, but the control was
[SPEAKER_00]: just the weakest plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't select the weakest plants for your
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned a number of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, if you're in a forested
area, here's something you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get organic milk in small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bury it up to the level of the milk so it
stays cool in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see if that turns to yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often that is good lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're getting right out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take that and you can actually
put that into a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to test different milks,
that's always a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can get commercial milks and
when you actually get it close to your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose, you know why that's not really a
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite milk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since I'm in Sonoma County,
it's Straus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straus organic milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in glass bottles and the neck is
just perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfect size for printing in microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an old school microbiology
flask, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it just shows people that
there's something already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people want to just wipe
everything out, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the sort of thing that Jeff
was saying before about double digging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, double digging now has evolved
so you're breaking up the lower soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not taking the soil and
completely flipping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it started out, they were flipping
the soil completely and they were wiping
[SPEAKER_00]: out all the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the example I gave was,
you know, ripping the soil and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: you're flipping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you go deeper than 10 inches and
expose it to full sun, you basically wiped
[SPEAKER_00]: out the fungi and you've got to do
something to replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, just going back to the idea
of teas, I don't know if anybody uses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many people here make tea,
compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people here have heard of Elaine
Ingman?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I was at the... We can't
promote him that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already standing.
But it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good that you've heard of Elaine
Ingman because, you know, she was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pioneers in sort of bringing the whole
tea culture thing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of people took it
pretty far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they started to use wheat grass
and, you know, wheat grass has zeotin in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and corn, seed corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you get different enzymes
when you make a fermentation out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put that in the tea too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things to experiment
and try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm drifting really far from the
question, but... We can bring it right
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff, since you haven't hit this one
yet and maybe you could actually name a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of species of plants that people
can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about inputs that people
can grow either at home that they can put
[SPEAKER_03]: into their plants that will be helpful and
save them some money or be done at a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial level where maybe they'll do,
you know, a handful of rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are those plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can get any number of cover
crops, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lentils.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of red clover and white
clovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their whole catalog is full of cover
crops and all of them will work fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I think that really you
need to do though is, as you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to know whether the stuff you're
using works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that means testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to test for NPK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to test for the microbiology
using a Lane Ingham's test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you've got to test using this new
micro biometer so you know what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to use these tests
intelligently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are expensive, some of them
are cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be able to meld them
together so that it works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to be able to retest to see
where you're trending.
[SPEAKER_02]: And too many of us don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a fine looking crop, you go,
hey, I must be doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know unless you test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information's power.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always been told that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, you know, as growers,
we don't test enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think once you test, then you start
putting in inputs because you want to test
[SPEAKER_02]: to see whether it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy a product, you test to see
whether it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't work, you don't buy it
again, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get that on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does start with growing your own
inputs if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow your own mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can collect your own mycorrhizal fungi
from natural areas around your property or
[SPEAKER_02]: around your existing grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your existing plants contain all sorts of
things that you want to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I always talk about you don't throw
away male plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the old root system for both males
and females because that's put
[SPEAKER_02]: unbelievable exudates into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to collect that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see somebody that's throwing away
their male plants, go collect that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to be intelligent about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we all are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're here at this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else is out in the sunshine
getting cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
That was cruel.
[SPEAKER_01]: To add to that, I think, you know,
overall, we think about this minimalist
[SPEAKER_01]: approach of having a living soil because
we want to reduce our inputs and keep what
[SPEAKER_01]: we have and continue to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to understand in that
particular substrate, plants are always
[SPEAKER_01]: taking away from that substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's allocating resources that it's
gaining mostly all nutrients from the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: into its biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're harvesting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's never a complete regenerative
in agriculture that there's not some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of replenishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's certain resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many growers are out
there using things like soil testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient analysis, where you know from one
crop to the next where your nutrients or
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates may be depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just add those specific
elements in with precision and not add
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your soil might not need
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might need so very few items where,
you know, and there's an example where
[SPEAKER_01]: even phosphorus, there is total of
phosphorus that might be in your substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: but not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So add a catalyst to maximize the
availability of that phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to add any phosphorus in
any cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of micronutrients are clear
examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen is always a horrible problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you need a source every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you use mammoth pee, you don't
have to use phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you can't even buy phosphorus
in long food anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the challenges with some
nutrients because it's been so abused in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're banning phosphorus in general
fertilizers unless you can prove that your
[SPEAKER_01]: soils need it significantly so you can
actually justify the purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it is a movement of
using biologicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just us that are up here
preaching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All agriculture segments are trying to
understand and adopt biology because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a necessity for our environment,
for the ecology, and for maximizing crop
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and yield, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of applications, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know, one thing that keeps
getting mentioned though is foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an article that came out in
Science Magazine last week, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: about foliar spraying compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it did to the fertilizer
situation in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There had also been foliar sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it did to the exudate mix in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a foliar spraying is,
apparent to me, something we need to study
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more than we have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We study the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not studying the foliar quite the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got to be careful when you
foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this article says that when you do
that above ground, you are impacting what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just Google foliar spray fertilizer
below ground under news for this week or
[SPEAKER_02]: last week, and you'll get the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or go to KetlecGarden.com and check out my
article on foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ketlec.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finishing up, I know this is crazy
because we've got all this experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they only gave us 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are complete here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the three fellows will be here for
questions afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the moment, we need to start
shifting for the next speaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much to John.
Good work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
