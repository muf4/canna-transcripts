[SPEAKER_01]: Hey there, I am here with Ari Singer of
Dynamike Inoculants, a new product for
[SPEAKER_01]: fungally inoculating your living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products come all the way from Israel,
and I asked Ari for a little bit of his
[SPEAKER_01]: time today here at Indo Expo Portland
because I'm happy to say that Dynamike is
[SPEAKER_01]: now a sponsor of the Shaping Fire podcast,
so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to help introduce everybody to what
this product is and the great success I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been having with it on Vashon Island where
I live, I asked Ari to give me a few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes so that we can all hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right, it's nice to see you,
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you again, thank you so much
for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let's start like it with the
basics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain to us what Dynamike does
to give people a frame of context on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so assuming someone is watching
this, he probably knows a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: about mycorrhizal fungi from listening to
your show and the guests who have been on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sets Dynamike apart is the
concentration, the ease of use,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a one-time application thing,
one and done pretty much when you
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant into your growing media,
and it can be soil, it can be cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a wide array of growing
medias, and what the fungus does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates this secondary network or root
system, secondary root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, it creates a hyphal network
which then allows the plant to absorb more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, water, and minerals which are
physically and chemically out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's reach, so that's pretty much what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially making a superhighway,
a fungal superhighway throughout the pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it expands the reach of the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and if you're growing in,
let's say, companion planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in nature, trees and plants actually
use this fungal network to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst themselves, so they can actually
transfer nutrients and water in a forest
[SPEAKER_00]: from one tree to another with this fungal
network, so it's pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, so far, I've gotten really
good results on it, and you gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of samples last time we got
together, and I've been handing them out
[SPEAKER_01]: to patients on Vachon Island to use in
their grows, and one of the things I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing to explain to them is not only
you're helping your pot have a
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighway of mycelium so that all the
nutrients can be grabbed by the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also we all know the benefits of
no-grain no-till, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that traditionally, we'll use new
soil every run, throw out the old soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you've always got this new virgin
soil without mycelium networks in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so every year, that has to regrow,
right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people love no-till because if
you're just going to harvest the other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and then put your new start next to
it, there's pre-existing mycelial networks
[SPEAKER_01]: so that that superhighway already exists,
but what I tell people is that if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to wait through your whole season for that
mycelial network to grow, there's all this
[SPEAKER_01]: time where your plant is not pulling in
all the nutrients that it could be,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you have to wait for a ramp up
period for your soil to get tasty,
right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But using dynamite, I have found an
incredible jump up in my plants from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning because I take some of the
granules and I make my little hole and I
[SPEAKER_01]: dust it in there, and then I transplant
into that, and you explain this so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain the magic that happens when the
roots come in contact with the dynamite
[SPEAKER_00]: grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a communication, a hormonal
signal that the plant will send out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus, and it's not like the fungus is
just knocking on every single plant door
[SPEAKER_00]: and asking, hey, can I show up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant will actually send out
hormones to get the fungus to come to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when the interaction will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like every single plant will
want a mycorrhizal association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's getting everything it can,
already it won't have this symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, but if you do inoculate it
at an early stage when it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything available, it will create the
symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earlier you inoculate your plants,
the better off you are because that way
[SPEAKER_00]: you create this secondary root system
right away, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your roots are very small and they
have nowhere to really grab nutrients from
[SPEAKER_00]: or water, right, you're in a small
container, that fungal network will really
[SPEAKER_00]: help the plants absorb more at an earlier
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen, I mean, you can see
literally five, six inch differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: height and also in stem girth just within
a month of inoculating plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earlier you get it, the better off you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I heard you say that before,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, well,
if the earlier the better, I want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this with my clones, which is not what's
on the package, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a free sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give this a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did is I took my clean spring
water that we get on Vashon and I took
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the granules and I mixed it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put that in the water beneath the
clones in the tray with my hope was that
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that would get soaked up into the
plugs and then the roots would somehow get
[SPEAKER_01]: turned on and like really reach for those,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the rooting would happen faster
and it totally worked, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it was supposed to work
that way, but it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got better rooting, more roots,
more fine hair, and in a faster period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like 12 days for that was
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, are you and other people
doing that or is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we launched Dynamite, we had two
application methods, but all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these different growers who
have other approaches to inoculating their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are showing us, you know,
they're sending us a video of them taking
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynamite, pouring it into a bucket of
water, and then just dunking their root
[SPEAKER_00]: riots or their rapid rooters, whatever the
plug is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just dipping them in,
you know, soaking them in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, the fungi are microscopic,
so they'll latch on to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously you have the people who
are just mixing it into their soil or into
[SPEAKER_00]: their cocoa or cocoa peat, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every day we get a video on
Instagram of another grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one week ago to now, seeing these
massive differences, and they're playing
[SPEAKER_00]: around with it, kind of exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool thing about Dynamite is that the
granules will break apart the moment they
[SPEAKER_00]: come into contact with water, which is not
common with a lot of other inoculants
[SPEAKER_00]: where the carrier is very firm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Dynamite, the moment it comes into
contact with water, it'll just break
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way those roots can get,
you know, can either penetrate those
[SPEAKER_00]: granules or get into contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Directly with the spores, the hyphae,
and the root fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a whole inoculum in Dynamite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a user, it makes it much easier to
break it up with your fingers and do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, by hand applications as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the other mycoinoculants
in the market, they are so hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're all like, boom, put this boulder
here, boom, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually, while we're on the topic
of comparing Dynamite to other folks in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market, and we won't use any names,
but it was funny to hear the talk around
[SPEAKER_01]: your booth here today about some of your
competitors coming up to you and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, how is this possible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you explain a little bit about
the concentration and why that was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that makes Dynamite especially
sweet?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we're dealing with microscopic
organisms, if your concentration is low,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chances of inoculating a plant
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower your concentration,
the slimmer the chances of inoculation
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Dynamite, what makes it unique is
that you're getting 900 propagules a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: of two species of endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ectomycorrhizal fungi don't have any
relationships with cannabis, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not in Dynamite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose two specific fungi that have
symbiotic relationships with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concentration is super,
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Jeff Lowenfeld saying once that
a plant has about 20 billion cells in its
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to take a very low
concentrated product and inoculating these
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 billion cells, you're going to have to
dump a lot of that product in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might not be financially feasible,
or it might not make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Dynamite, you're getting a highly
concentrated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at 900 propagules per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a very concentrated product
at an application rate, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: about the same as any of the other
products out there on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting more bang for your buck.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the larger the concentration,
the more likely you are to inoculate your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that sets us
apart, is the high concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of our IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a patent on it, but we do
not reveal our secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said earlier today,
we had someone from a competing company
[SPEAKER_00]: come and approach us and ask us how we do
900.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to also know that even
though this may be the first time you're
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing Dynamite, it's not like they just
whipped this together in a bathtub.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a product that was researched at a
university and then kind of got spun out
[SPEAKER_01]: into this for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us just a little snippet of where
it's from scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 25 years of R&D at Volkani
Institute in Israel, which is the leading
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural research center in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it spun off and that's
what we've been doing ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been formulating new products,
different concentrations, different
[SPEAKER_00]: application methods, trying to really dial
in on the exact combination of strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: of carriers also, which will allow plants
and growers to maximize their yields and
[SPEAKER_00]: their plant's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we wrap up, I know the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been giving out samples all across
the US for like six months, which is how I
[SPEAKER_01]: and a bunch of people have gotten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all sending you videos and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to actually see the
informal studies, go to the Dynamite
[SPEAKER_01]: Inoculants Instagram, where they're
posting all the photos that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: sending along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, as far as it being for sale,
you've only been getting registered in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States in like the last two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people see the video and they're
like, I want to check this stuff out,
[SPEAKER_01]: where can they get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, Grow Generation just picked
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have about 26 or 27 stores across the
nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoag Tech Hydroponics in Bellingham,
Fed City Hydro in Federal Way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Washington locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many states are they in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because registration takes time,
we haven't been able to get into all these
[SPEAKER_00]: stores physically yet because you're not
allowed to sell them on the shelves yet
[SPEAKER_00]: until it's registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just got registered in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be expecting to see Dynamite In
stores in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland's coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oregon also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State, Colorado as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major states where recreational
cannabis has been legalized already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're at already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anybody who's selling it online,
like any online grow shops where people in
[SPEAKER_01]: states that you haven't gotten into could
buy it and have it shipped to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hoag Tech Hydroponics is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Generation, I'm sure, will be also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be getting to more
stores in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still a small group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small company, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what the packaging looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you're going to be looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you watch the Shaping Fire podcast,
or listen to it, or if you watch the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel, you know that we don't
take money from synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very much into regenerative
agriculture, healthy living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I came across Dynamite,
I'm like, this is exactly the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that fits within my values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really grateful that you responded
positively to my pitch and are now going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have commercials on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am super stoked to have commercials on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your show for about
a year already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything you've been putting out has
been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our honor to be advertising on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super stoked for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I hope you quick growth of the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
