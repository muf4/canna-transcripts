[SPEAKER_00]: It was late 2015 when I first watched
overly excited and inexperienced new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis executives totally fail at
interstate brand licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were an Oregon company seeking to
expand their brand into Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lead negotiator on the Washington
side of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deal as it appeared on paper was
really more of a franchise agreement than
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a brand licensing deal,
and I saw it as packed with red flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It included some attributes that were
downright fraud to get around the state
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership laws here in Washington,
and then another part of the deal would
[SPEAKER_00]: have cost my clients their license because
of how they were intending to move the
[SPEAKER_00]: money around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these were not bad people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were folks who just didn't know
enough about business to do it the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way, and they were very driven to find a
creative solution in the morass of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily for us, another cannabis business
was publicly reprimanded for trying to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up the same kind of licensing deal our
suitors wanted to set up with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone realized that my cautious
read of the situation was spot on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody involved walked away from
that deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wildly common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stories I've heard from
California and Nevada recently have
[SPEAKER_00]: similar blatantly fraudulent and
unenforceable traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's show is intended to give you
context on the differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing and franchising, how to choose
partners, and how to think correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: through your opportunities in cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and I'm your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Chris Crane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Crane is a 20-year veteran of the
cannabis industry, first starting out in
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy before moving over to business
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2000 to 2005, he was associate
director of Normal and then became
[SPEAKER_00]: executive director of Students for
Sensible Drug Policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In June of this year, he was elected to a
third term on the board of directors of
[SPEAKER_00]: the National Cannabis Industry
Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now president and co-founder of
Forefront, a leading investment and
[SPEAKER_00]: operations firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris has clients and speaks at cannabis
conventions all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is highly sought after by companies
scaling their cannabis operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he also happens to be a really nice
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're gonna talk about interstate
brand licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanna note that we experienced some
technical difficulties while recording
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Chris and I were both in
professional studios, we were still
[SPEAKER_00]: talking via the internet, and some days,
packets just don't travel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear some pops during the first
set, but they do settle down as the show
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on and eventually kind of go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be all right, and we appreciate
you hanging with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by getting everybody on the
same page, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody thinks they've got an
idea about what's going on with licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: and franchising and everyone's expansion
to other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of people, they don't
necessarily understand why this is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly, we're seeing some brands
break out as clear leaders in their
[SPEAKER_00]: origination state, the state that they are
from, that they built their first business
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these companies are eyeing
expansion into other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explain this to folks, would you
explain why expansion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond one state is so attractive to these
companies and perhaps even necessary in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis market that we're looking at
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think like any business,
you're gonna want to expand your business
[SPEAKER_01]: once successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're operational in one state and
you're doing well in one state,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna want to expand that
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the big difference between
the cannabis industry and other businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: is that if you're successful in a state,
let's use micro-brews, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you set up a successful
micro-brew in Colorado, you gain good
[SPEAKER_01]: market share in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing some popularity online
for your products in some neighboring
[SPEAKER_01]: states, say California and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start expanding into those
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would simply increase your production
capacity at your cultivation, in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case, your brewing facility in Colorado,
and you would start shipping product into
[SPEAKER_01]: California and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's simply not possible in the cannabis
industry because it's still federally
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal and because of the state-by-state
nature of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a product that's gaining
popularity and you want to expand your
[SPEAKER_01]: market share, expand your market,
you have to go to another state and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to get another license in that other
state, which may not be the easiest thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most states, they have very competitive
application processes where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be competing against lots of other
operators from around the country as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as some homegrown folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of those states, there just
aren't licenses available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many states have a limit on the number of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grant all of those at once and then
they're not available beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way to get into those other
states would be either to acquire a
[SPEAKER_01]: license in another state, to basically buy
somebody else's business, or to license
[SPEAKER_01]: your brand to a license holder in another
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you have a product brand,
somebody wins a production license in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get in there, there's no
licenses available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the capital or don't want
to buy that license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could find a willing partner in
another state and license that brand to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially you're licensing your
intellectual property, your SOPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: your method to production, and your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would then start producing and
selling your brand and give you some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of licensing fee or royalty agreement back
to the main company.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I would just want to point
out in terms of why people are looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this is this is a growing industry and
it's very hard to be a successful business
[SPEAKER_01]: just operating in one state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would want to go state to state to
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at what's happening,
for example, in the public markets where
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada, a lot of these US companies are
going getting listed, there's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite for multi-state operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's much less of an appetite in terms
of getting publicly listed and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: investment into your company if you're a
single state operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's also been a big motivation,
I think, over the last year for folks to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into multiple states because it
provides them with better access to
[SPEAKER_01]: capital, which in a federally illegal
industry with no access to traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional lending is particularly
attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big role that access to capital plays,
because in the early years, some five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, there were a lot of folks who
were planning on doing it on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they realized that the only way
they were going to get access to capital
[SPEAKER_00]: is from people who wanted them to hit a
grand slam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was no longer really people just
doing a solid job in their state of
[SPEAKER_00]: origination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, if people wanted to get capital,
they needed to have as part of their pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: what their national expansion was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along that thought, Chris, do you think
that there's going to be much future for
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that choose to stay in one state
and don't expand into other states?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's going to get
progressively harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those that will survive as a
solo state operator are largely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be those folks who have a really solid
craft brand in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a place for craft
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the highest quality flour, the highest
quality products, where you would have a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard time doing that as a much larger
scale operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those folks will find a way to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, the walls of interstate
commerce are going to come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, there'll be an
ability for some of those single state
[SPEAKER_01]: operators to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, your state doesn't really
matter as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting orders from just across
the border, which some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeastern states might be a 45-minute
drive away, that's no longer a relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell into another state once
interstate commerce opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, too, the other potential avenue
for the solo operators, and we're starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to see this now, frankly, is to be
acquired themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can build a really solid brand
in one state, whether it's a prop brand or
[SPEAKER_01]: as a great cultivator or even a great
retail brand, as some of these larger
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-state consolidators and multi-state
operators start looking to acquire assets
[SPEAKER_01]: and grow their license portfolio,
those who have done a really nice job of
[SPEAKER_01]: operating a single store or a single
operation within one state are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, attractive targets to these
multi-state consolidators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we all know, you only really need to
worry about the difficulty in expanding to
[SPEAKER_00]: another state if you're actually a license
holder in your particular state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corollary companies like making bongs or
being a tax accountant firm or all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that you don't have to hold a
license for, you guys can just expand like
[SPEAKER_00]: you traditionally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's folks who actually have got a
state license where you are either a
[SPEAKER_00]: producer of the flower, a processor of it
in some way, transport or a retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm curious is, from your
experience, are you finding that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular niches of that set of market is
finding an easier time of expanding than
[SPEAKER_00]: others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the state because states
have very different caps on the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses and ways to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, to get a cultivation
license in Nevada is fairly easy or was
[SPEAKER_01]: very easy in the application process and
would be relatively easy to acquire
[SPEAKER_01]: because they granted 180 cultivation
licenses for a state of about 4 million
[SPEAKER_01]: people compared to say in Illinois where
there are 19 cultivation slash production
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses for a state of 13 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those licenses are much, much more
difficult to acquire or to even win in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has less to do with which part of
the vertical you're in, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: production, dispensary, as opposed to what
state you're looking to expand into,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the availability of licenses are in
those states, either from a license
[SPEAKER_01]: application standpoint or an acquisition
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so like a guy like you who is
working in many of the states from your
[SPEAKER_00]: own group, Forefront Ventures,
and are also probably assisting some other
[SPEAKER_00]: people in other states where Forefront
Ventures is not working themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: where have you seen to be the hardest
states to move into so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for what reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've mostly been states in the
eastern half of the US, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily a combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But number one is the limit on the number
of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a lot of these states in the eastern
half of the country, there's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: small number of overall licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the applications for these licenses are
incredibly competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you put together, in some
states, I would say if you put together an
[SPEAKER_01]: A plus team with an A plus quality
application and like an A plus lobbying
[SPEAKER_01]: effort, you might have a 10 to 15% chance
of winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't put all that together,
you may as well not even bother applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would look at states like Florida and
New York, for example, states that fit
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey has been similar, though we
think New Jersey is about to open up to
[SPEAKER_01]: more licenses later on this year and into
next year as they expand their medical
[SPEAKER_01]: program and expand into recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a state like Illinois, where,
again, there's 13 million people and 19
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator producer licenses, that's a
very difficult state to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by and large, it's the states in the
northeast or in the eastern half of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country with the limited licenses,
very challenging application processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and fairly strict regulatory environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you have to be able to win
a license or acquire a license,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be able to navigate what's
generally stricter regulatory environments
[SPEAKER_01]: than you get in many of the western
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, there are savvy business
people in every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we've seen, there's a certain
amount of, I don't know, corporate memory
[SPEAKER_00]: creep of how to do cannabis business
specifically that comes along with
[SPEAKER_00]: normalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has generally been coming from
the west coast across the country as more
[SPEAKER_00]: states first adopt medical and then move
their way towards rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that there is, that along with
setting up these licensing arrangements
[SPEAKER_00]: going east, that there's not only a lot of
just simple negotiating the licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's bringing these otherwise
competent entrepreneurs up to speed going
[SPEAKER_00]: east, just so they understand the new
moving parts in this industry that hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: existed before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you, I'm sorry, can you repeat the
question there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't quite get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point I'm trying to bring out here is
that there are good business people
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they may not necessarily know cannabis
business specifically in every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you finding that as cannabis is moving
into these new states, that yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to reach out, you need to find
partners, you need to negotiate what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do with the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you also have to
teach cannabis business because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: different and unique to other types of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at some of the more
successful operators in particularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: these more challenging states,
what you typically see, and I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in terms of both winning the
license and then operating licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you typically see is a combination of
business experience and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, local political experience as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these licenses are somewhat
political in terms of how they're granted,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if states like to say they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to give friends to locals to
a degree as well, sometimes implicitly,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes explicit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the combination of having really
good local business people who might have
[SPEAKER_01]: good political connections or good real
estate connections who partner up with
[SPEAKER_01]: folks who have really good experience from
outside of that state that can help
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrate competency in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that combination tends to do fairly
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a bit harder for the business people
who've never done cannabis to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do this on their own without a
significant dose of education in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And likewise, I think for folks who
started in cannabis, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: more sort of great markets in California,
prior to the last year or so when real
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations came into place, a lot of
those folks had a really hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: navigating these much more complex
regulatory environments in the eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: half of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that combination has proven to
be relatively successful and frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly necessary for both sides of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first short
break a little early and try to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: that pop in the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Chris Crane, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Forefront Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a business owner, you are incredibly
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, you are responsible for
everything your company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many responsibilities every
single day that often you just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to really dig into your marketing
as deeply as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's more that you could do to
reach out to new customers and encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty in the customers you do have,
but you certainly don't have the time for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not really ready to hire
someone full time for that role either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, I recommend Blunt Branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Blunt Branding, Kirsten Nelson and her
team are focused on improving your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most marketing firms are excited
to make your logo, packaging, and website
[SPEAKER_00]: very pretty, but they leave responsibility
for improving your bottom line up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want that kind of
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's pretty much the most important
part of marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team will help you engage
new customers, funnel them to your point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale, whether it be online or
storefront, and keep them coming back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you and telling their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you happen to be a new cannabis
company or an established company moving
[SPEAKER_00]: from medical to adult use in your state,
Kirsten especially can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is she well-versed in marketing
and finance, but she totally gets
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whole plant medicine,
terpenes, heritage farmers, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular needs of startups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what she did recently for Moon
Time Medicinals in Humboldt County at
[SPEAKER_00]: MoonTimeMedicinals.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirsten and her team put together a whole
brand package for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt, this is a paid commercial spot,
but that does not mean that they bought my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with Blunt Branding on four
projects now for various clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and every single time, they have done more
than they've promised and over-delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: on results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they generate new revenue and
focus on that as the goal instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: making you a pretty logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, every single friend I've
referred them to has come back to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't happen every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a pen and paper because the website
address is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want someone to implement marketing
programs that feed your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_00]: give Blunt Branding a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will share proven techniques to
increase your audience and generate sales
[SPEAKER_00]: while using cutting edge technology
solutions in the background that make all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this easy, automatic, and trackable.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Chris Crane, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Forefront Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked a lot
about why a company would be looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand beyond their origination state for
all sorts of good reasons from spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk around to accessing more capital
and also just to be able to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: established national brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that gets people in
a bad position constantly is a confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: between licensing and franchising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're gonna talk about
primarily today here in the second set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, now that we've established the
why, let's focus on the heart and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between licensing and
franchising.
[SPEAKER_00]: People oftenly mistakenly think that
they're synonymous, but they are certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: not and they're really not even
interchangeable for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the primary differences between
licensing and franchising?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so it's a good question and you're
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really do often get this one wrong
and they use the words interchangeably,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're quite different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing to get across is I don't
think there is any franchising in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are some groups that have
looked at doing it, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody's actually running a traditional
franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to back up, the main difference between
licensing and franchising is licensing is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially you are giving somebody the
right to use your brand and potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: your intellectual property, some operating
protocols, your methods of production and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they have the right to use that and
they pay you some fee to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Franchising agreements are much more
broad, so they give you the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially sell all of those things,
your name of your brand, your SOPs,
[SPEAKER_01]: your protocols, your methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have a much greater degree of
control over your franchisee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a franchise agreement, you can tell
your franchisor you must offer these sales
[SPEAKER_01]: on these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your store must look exactly this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must buy your products from these
vendors or you must buy these products
[SPEAKER_01]: from us specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A franchisor can tell you where you can
locate and where you can't locate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they can tell you where you have
to locate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go and buy a Dunkin' Donuts,
for example, you have no freedom over what
[SPEAKER_01]: that Dunkin' Donuts looks like,
over where you buy your products,
[SPEAKER_01]: over where you buy your donut-making
materials and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in a licensing agreement,
it's very difficult to get into that level
[SPEAKER_01]: of detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So licensees have a bit more freedom than
a franchisee would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licenseurs also have to jump through
significantly fewer hoops than franchisors
[SPEAKER_01]: would have to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to be a franchisor,
you have to come up with what's called a
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise disclosure document,
an FDD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very specific guidelines that
govern what would go into an FDD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of disclosures about the
owners of the company, any business that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've done, anybody that you've offered
franchises to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a few hundred pages of background
information, information about the
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are rules around how you franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to give that document to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You then can't contact them for something
like a week to make sure they have time to
[SPEAKER_01]: review it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, then they can get out of their
franchise agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a real process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in about half the states or over
half the states, you have to file with the
[SPEAKER_01]: state corporate board or franchise board
to be recognized as a franchisor in that
[SPEAKER_01]: state in order to offer a franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those are necessary for licensing
agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: A licensing agreement, any good corporate
attorney can put together a license
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You negotiate that with the attorney on
the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all agree to what parameters you're
going to operate under, but you won't,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the licensor, have the same degree of
control over your licensee that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: as a franchisor or over their franchisee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tease out where that threshold is,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while in a license relationship,
you can't call out everything as
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically as in a franchise
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are some things that you
can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I would think the deployment
of the brand and what the brand looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like, essentially the brand usage book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably stays consistent since
that's part of what's being licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where does that end?
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it end as soon as you start
talking about the operations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company or is it only particular parts of
the operation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not really a clear line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should disclaim all this by saying I'm
not an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really thinking about becoming a
franchisor or a franchisee or a licensee,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to seek out a good corporate
attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on the franchise side of things,
definitely seek out a franchise attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: or specific attorneys that handle these
kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about this at the high level,
but my understanding is there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: concrete line between what would
constitute a franchise versus a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's things like you can say you have the
right to use the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brand has to stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just change the logo or do
something that's going to be detrimental
[SPEAKER_01]: to the overall brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'd have to set out certain
guidelines as to this is what we expect
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks and feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't dictate how they run their
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can't say in a licensing
agreement, you have to buy all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: products from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to buy these products from these
vendors and you have to buy this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular type of floorboard for your
store and this particular type of display
[SPEAKER_01]: case for your store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a little bit of that as long as
what you're contracting around is to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect the integrity of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't tell them they have to do
this, they have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fees also tend to be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a licensing agreement, you can have all
different kinds of fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody could pay you a flat fee per
month to license your brand and your
[SPEAKER_01]: operations protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could pay you a royalty on sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a franchise agreement, it's much more
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You typically pay a upfront fee as your
upfront franchise fee and then there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing percent of sales back to the
franchisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some which are ongoing franchise fees,
some which are joint marketing fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually the franchisor will do
marketing for all of their franchises in
[SPEAKER_01]: an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, again, if you go back to
Dunkin' Donuts, having lived in Boston for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last four years, it's a good one to
use for me since you can't throw a rock
[SPEAKER_01]: without hitting a Dunkin' Donuts in the
Boston area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's hundreds of Dunkin' Donuts in
the Boston area, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't each go out and do their own
advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corporate franchise or Dunkin' Donuts
does all the advertising for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: franchises in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll run the advertising on Boston
radio, on Boston TV, online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to the benefit of the
franchisees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to then go out and spend
that money themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also why it's important for the
franchise or to make sure that if somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: walks into one Dunkin' Donuts and then
they walk into another Dunkin' Donuts half
[SPEAKER_01]: mile down the road, that all of the
products are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The displays are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look and feel is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the exact same experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's much harder to dictate through a
licensing agreement than it is through a
[SPEAKER_01]: franchising agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dig a little deeper into that
because I thought I had an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the threshold was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized I don't because I
thought that we were going to say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold for a license is that you're
licensing the brand and that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a franchise relationship,
it's more operational based on the how-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this last answer, you said that the
licensees will license both the brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: the SOPs, the standard operating
procedures, how the company can run
[SPEAKER_00]: internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests to me that perhaps the
threshold between a franchise and a
[SPEAKER_00]: license may be perhaps on the enforcement
of the operating procedures because from
[SPEAKER_00]: my understanding with a franchise,
they can send people from the home office
[SPEAKER_00]: to the franchised location and run them
through a bunch of questions to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything is running as it's
supposed to in the operating procedures
[SPEAKER_00]: from the home office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that with licensees,
that actually breaks the law and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do that kind of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit that a little bit if you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my understanding is that that's
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is where the lines get a
little bit blurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is clear is as a franchisor,
absolutely, you can send folks from home
[SPEAKER_01]: office and say, look, if you're not doing
all this, we have the right to take your
[SPEAKER_01]: store away and take another franchisor
from another store and give it to them if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not maintaining the integrity of
our brand and our stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case with a licensing
agreement or you're going to have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through a number of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to claim contract
infringement and then there has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: steps to remedy that infringement within
the contract that you would take as a
[SPEAKER_01]: franchisor towards your licensee,
give them the opportunity to cure that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're dealing much with a standard
contract law rather than what you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: a franchise agreement where the
franchisors have a great deal of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The licensing is not necessarily just
around a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is often around the operating protocols
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's say, for example,
somebody develops a better way to create
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis infused patches, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of like a whatever, Mary's
Medicinals or Manna Molecular,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do a patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the transdermal kind of patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transdermal, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transdermal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say somebody comes up with a
really good way to do transdermal patches
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have their own brand,
say in Illinois, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody from Arkansas comes and
says, I'd really like to use that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brand in Illinois isn't, you know,
it's known in Illinois, but like nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Arkansas knows your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't put a whole lot of value in the
brand itself because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody knows it here and I can put that
out on the shelves and they're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to know that from any other transdermal
patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your methodology is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really interested in that and I want
to build my own brand around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could license the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you've created some kind of
machine that creates the transdermal patch
[SPEAKER_01]: and then standard operating procedures or
standard operating protocols for how you
[SPEAKER_01]: operate that machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could license that machine and those
operating procedures, but say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can just white label it,
put your own brand on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have our brand,
but you have to use the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're licensing you the ability to use
this machine so you don't own the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're licensing you to use it and we're
licensing you the intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes along with how to operate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would also fall under the
category of a licensing agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have to include the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with a franchise, it's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the brand, it's the operations,
it's the SOPs, it's the look and feel,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's who you buy stuff from, it's how much
you pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a franchisor, again,
we'll go back to the Dunkin' Donuts
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you own a Dunkin' Donuts and
some vendor hits you up and is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I can sell you the same flower that
you're buying from Dunkin' for half the
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to save you 10 cents on
every 50 cent donut that you create or
[SPEAKER_01]: that you cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the right to do that as a
franchisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, that's a clear violation
of your franchise agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could potentially lose your store
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of enforcement becomes much more
difficult in a licensing agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one more question I want to
keep banging at this license versus
[SPEAKER_00]: franchising at the threshold point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that there's a gray area,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny thing about gray area and
business people, including myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: is on one hand, you want to get rid of
these gray areas because these gray areas
[SPEAKER_00]: create risk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all trying to decrease the
amount of risk that surrounds our business
[SPEAKER_00]: investment of time and capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I also know that as
a business person, I've done most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: best deals in the gray areas of arbitrage,
kind of like finding loopholes and
[SPEAKER_00]: exploiting them to my benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, eh, gray area is good or
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is the arbiter of the gray area?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing it's some federal group who,
when push came to shove, if a decision was
[SPEAKER_00]: to be made, whether or not something was
licensed or franchised, there's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who plays umpire to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who does it eventually fall to?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a federal agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And off the top of my head, I'm not
recalling the name of the agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Federal Franchise Board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a federal agency that looks at
this, although my understanding is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually mostly done at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most states will license franchises
through either their franchise board or
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even states that you don't have
to register as a franchise or they still
[SPEAKER_01]: have oversight over franchises because you
still have to go through the FDD
[SPEAKER_01]: disclosure process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a long process you have to go
through in order to be a franchise or in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to sell franchises.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could get in trouble at either the
state or the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a category of law,
but there's a term called accidental
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise, which is what gets people in
trouble if they are essentially acting as
[SPEAKER_01]: a franchise or without having gone through
the full franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get fined as an accidental
franchise, their licensing agreements can
[SPEAKER_01]: all be basically nullified.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, they can get massive fines,
they can lose a lot of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, very important if you're
looking to get into licensing or any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of licensing agreement that you consult
with a good corporate attorney or even a
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise attorney to make sure you're not
running afoul of accidental franchise
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that generally comes down to the level
of control that you're giving your
[SPEAKER_01]: licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if you're if you're just saying,
look, you have the right to use our brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have the right to do anything
that would besmirch our brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: or bring down brand value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to you know,
if you're looking for some if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to use our methodology,
we really need you to stick to those SOPs
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can gunk up our machines if
you don't do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start saying you have to buy
certain things from certain people at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain times, you have to do things
certain ways, you have to offer certain
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and certain days, and we're going to
do joint marketing for you and all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: other licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you're starting to look like a
franchisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the kind of stuff that get you
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is which a lot
because a lot of people don't recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between franchise and
licensing is just don't use the word
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of people who've had like,
oh, yeah, I've got this great brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to go and we're going to
franchise the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, have you talked to a franchise
attorney about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do you plan to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to license this and
we're going to license that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use the word franchise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a licensure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a franchisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's like the number one thing that
gets somebody in trouble for accidental
[SPEAKER_01]: franchises.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the word franchise because they
just don't know the difference and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get the distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to make sure that you
work with a good corporate lawyer who
[SPEAKER_01]: really understands franchise law and
accidental franchise so that your
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts are set up the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your marketing materials are set up the
right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your licensing agreements are set up the
right way so you don't accidentally run
[SPEAKER_01]: afoul of these these quote unquote
accidental franchise laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we understand all of that,
we're going to go to our second commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: break and we come back for set three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about how actually to
implement one of these licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements and some pitfalls to watch out
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break and
we'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Chris Crane, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Forefront Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a listener of Shaping Fire,
you already understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil when growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have active microbe communities
in your substrate, you go way beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: simply fertilizing with nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having active microorganisms in your
substrate supports vigorous plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant's root zone,
making for higher yields and thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is the first organically
derived microbial inoculant that focuses
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plant's nutrient cycling processes
to release soil phosphorus and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients from their bound forms,
making them more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased levels of phosphorus will also
keep inner nodes shorter and focus your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's energy on bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but the microbes act as a
defense shield for the plant's rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: by outcompeting potentially harmful
pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea not only unlocks the nutrients
in your soil, but it also helps protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea's beneficial bacteria act like
microbioreactors, continually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea was developed at a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: university and has been extensively tested
by Colorado growers and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is proven to increase growth
and enhance blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about
supplementing with microorganisms is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't compete with whatever
fertilizer program you're already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply dose on top of your fertilizer
schedule for increased benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more and to find out where you
can buy mammoth pea near you, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: their website at www.mammothmicrobes.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And partner with microorganisms to create
beautiful, thriving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the health benefits of terpenes
have become well-known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people everywhere are looking
for the purest terpenes without
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most terpene providers is
that they're not sourced naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: instead are made as a byproduct of
refining petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes sold by True Terpenes are
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are certified organic, non-GMO,
and food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that they are extracted from
real plant sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no solvents of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are distilled only with steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, only steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, terpenes from True Terpenes are
so pure that you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but you can stack them with
better results too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is, other companies' terpenes
have got a few percent of impurities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you stack those terpenes to make
your blend, you're adding a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities that degrade your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes also have strain-specific
terpenes for a wide range of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like Durbin Poison, Sunset
Sherbet, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes has robust and supportive
customer service, so your questions will
[SPEAKER_00]: get answered fast and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've shopped for terpes before,
you know how rare that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-karyophylline to calm down
[SPEAKER_00]: after getting too high, or if you want to
dab some pining so your lungs feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous and your mind feels liberated,
True Terpenes will provide you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: truly natural experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a cannabis product developer,
these are the terpes you want to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: your oil or edible or capsule or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Terpenes are simply the best your
money can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try and make a premium product with
substandard terpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose True Terpenes for a top-shelf
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to shapingfire.com board slash true
terpenes to find out more or click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: link in this week's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is Chris Crane, co-founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: Forefront Ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the first set, we talked about
why folks are wanting to license and
[SPEAKER_00]: expand in other states, and during set
two, we really dug deeply into licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: and franchising, so we got a really good
idea of what it means to license your
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, how to go about doing that,
and how to not get tripped up by
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements that are actually franchising,
which we cannot yet do now in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I now want to understand how
we would reach out to parties in our new
[SPEAKER_00]: host target state if we want to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that we are either in,
say, for example, Washington, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: totally broke, so a lot of the companies
here are looking to expand into new states
[SPEAKER_00]: to hopefully have a greener future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, in California,
everybody wants to expand nationally
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody is aggressive as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that we have got our company
and we're ready to move to another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, how do we find good, reliable folks
in the target state that we want to move
[SPEAKER_00]: into to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: So by and large, there aren't that many
license holders in most of these states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most states, there are caps on the
overall number of licenses, and oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: the states list the winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can usually go onto the state's
health department or revenue department
[SPEAKER_01]: website and get a list of all the
licensees in those states.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can often then go onto their corporate
commission website and find their
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate foundation documents,
which usually have some sort of contact
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or oftentimes, they may even have a
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contact them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that difficult, by and large,
to find out who the licensees are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by licensees, I mean people who hold
state licenses in these new states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are going to be your targets to
license your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to go to somebody who has a
production license, a cultivation license,
[SPEAKER_01]: a dispensary license, depending on what it
is that you're looking to license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not going to go into one of
these states and win a license yourself or
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire a license yourself, it's not that
difficult to find out who holds those
[SPEAKER_01]: state licenses and then figure out a way
to reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're vetting folks in the target
state, because let's say there could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hundred or more of these people that
you're targeting, what do you look at as a
[SPEAKER_00]: first-level vetting of who you might want
to go to first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think much like with just about
anything, you want to feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: with the management team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to find out who the owners
are, who the managers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do some diligence on them,
do some background checks, ask for
[SPEAKER_01]: references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you feel comfortable with the
management team themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it really depends on what it is
you're looking to license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a retailer, for example,
and you're looking to license your retail
[SPEAKER_01]: brand, you're going to want to see where
are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they fit the types of areas that you
like to locate your retail store?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're the type of company that you
want your stores on main streets and high
[SPEAKER_01]: populated areas, you probably aren't going
to be as interested in somebody who has a
[SPEAKER_01]: more rural or suburban location.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a product manufacturer,
you want to make sure that the license
[SPEAKER_01]: holder has good operating capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cultivator and you're trying
to license cultivation methodology,
[SPEAKER_01]: do they have a good cultivation facility
that would fit the types of operations
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols that we're going to be
licensing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is this a bad fit from a location
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: You also want to think about distribution,
particularly when you're looking at larger
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Illinois, where I currently live,
there are a number of producers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call downstate in the southern
part of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's logistically challenging for them
to get their products into the Chicago
[SPEAKER_01]: market on a regular basis because they're
not allowed to warehouse their products in
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime they want to make a shipment or
they got to drive five, six hours to
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicago to drop things off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might want to look for somebody
who has a cultivation or production
[SPEAKER_01]: facility that's closer to the more dense
markets where it's not going to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these will factor in,
but it really does depend on what segment
[SPEAKER_01]: of the market you're looking at and what
your ultimate goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that when setting up a
licensing agreement that when going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the negotiation process and
putting numbers and compensation into the
[SPEAKER_00]: document, it's probably relatively common
for the licensee and the licensor to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different perceived values of the brand
where the parent company thinks that their
[SPEAKER_00]: brand is worth a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the licensee is all like, meh,
you're not in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you seen about that where they
have got different values for the brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something we saw play out a
lot more a few years ago, particularly as
[SPEAKER_01]: these East Coast states were really just
starting to come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had brands like Dixie or Openvape,
for example, which at that time were
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the two biggest brands on the
West Coast who had a big market share in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And California in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people were winning licenses in
places like Massachusetts or Illinois or
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada or Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these companies were coming in and
they were marketing themselves as the best
[SPEAKER_01]: brand in the industry, household names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was a real disconnect
between the brand owners and the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: licensees in that the brand owners often
really valued the brand itself thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, we've got all this market share
in Colorado, all this market share in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love our brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brand is a household name.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brand itself comes with a nice
premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should pay up for the right to use
that brand because it's such a good
[SPEAKER_01]: established brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a lot of the folks in these newer
states were looking at is going,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, yeah, people know Dixie in Colorado
and California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to go out and poll most
cannabis consumers and most patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois or Massachusetts or Connecticut,
most of them probably won't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm more interested in as the
potential licensee is your operating
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do marijuana infused beverages
or I want to do vape pen cartridges,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't really know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that trying to do it on my own,
I'm going to make a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes and I'm going to have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to impact my sales in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to pay a licensing agreement
to use your SOPs and your operating
[SPEAKER_01]: protocols and your equipment and not have
to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really care as much about
whether my products are called Dixie or if
[SPEAKER_01]: I create something new on my own that's
new to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually, I think, a reason why a
lot of those early licensing agreements
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't work is because there was a real
disconnect over the value of the brand
[SPEAKER_01]: itself versus the value of the operations
protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think, too, that there would have
to be some really intense thinking by a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand who was being asked to license their
SOPs without the brand because potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be creating a competitor in
their own market who are making quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products just like them, but then not
using their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that would be a real
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why a lot of these early
agreements didn't get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're seeing more of them get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've seen more movement on both
sides towards a consensus of what these
[SPEAKER_01]: brands are worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, by and large, you're not so much
concerned that you're creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitor within your own market because
by and large, with the nature of this
[SPEAKER_01]: being state by state, you're going to
markets where you're not already there and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to license that technology and
license that brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the owners of the companies,
the value to them is really in the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get that brand out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a Dixie or you're an
Incredibles or you're an O-Pen or one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these or wanna brands, you want to get
that brand out there in these other
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your best way to do that is through a
licensing agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gets challenging when the person on
the other side is going, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the protocols, but I don't really
care about your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of want to develop my own
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to then stop and think,
is it worth it for me to help create a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though reality is I'm getting a cut
of their sales, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the licensing agreement's not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I help create someone who becomes a
really good competitor, I'm still
[SPEAKER_01]: benefiting from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm probably not benefiting in the way
that I would if it were my brand that were
[SPEAKER_01]: being promoted because that then helps me
expand that brand into other parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps boost my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brand profile may help boost my
valuation as a company because I can point
[SPEAKER_01]: to my brand being in all these different
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see from the standpoint of a
licensor why it might be on starter for
[SPEAKER_01]: many of them to just say, yeah,
I'm gonna license technology and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do whatever brand you want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that in and of itself, I think,
is a business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're starting from the point of
having a really well-established brand in
[SPEAKER_01]: a more mature market, you're probably
going to want to make sure that that brand
[SPEAKER_01]: is being promulgated around the country
and you're not just seeding competitors
[SPEAKER_01]: with the know-how that you've learned
through your years of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I talk with my
clients about a lot is what's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market after interstate commerce is
allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of these not necessarily
robust companies in individual states are
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna get crushed from
competitiveness, primarily from
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be artists and brands in
individual states that stay strong and can
[SPEAKER_00]: hold off the onslaught from places where
it's nicer to grow and maybe they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: more in-state talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would think that once interstate
commerce is something that we can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will also impact the likelihood of
licenses and that whole ecosystem will
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see interstate commerce
impacting the licensing market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interstate commerce will change things
pretty dramatically, although I think
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate commerce is gonna take a while
to roll out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when it happens, I don't think
it's something that happens overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the state-by-state nature of this
probably stays in play for a little while
[SPEAKER_01]: as interstate commerce is opening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think companies that are spending tens
of millions of dollars building out
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of thousands of square feet of
cultivation space in the eastern half of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country might find themselves in some
real trouble when interstate commerce does
[SPEAKER_01]: open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think interstate commerce, you're right,
I think is largely gonna be out west in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of where the cultivation is gonna
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The atmospheric conditions in the eastern
half of the country are really tough for
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, much more humid, much bigger
temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for all those reasons, I think
you're gonna be seeing large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses in places like the Central
Valley of California and Arizona and
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada, Colorado even, high deserts with
fewer temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see outdoor in other parts of
California in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a bit of an aside, when we talk about
what we do at forefront and we're very
[SPEAKER_01]: focused in the eastern half of the
country, we do some cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's very targeted, and we're not
doing a really massive-scale cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, I think when that
comes, this commoditizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wholesale prices are going to fall
through the floor once you can grow on a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, it's still a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly if you're talking about
growing for extraction, where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really care as much about the quality of
the buds, you just care about volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: the prices are gonna come way,
way, way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at where we're interested
in playing the market, we're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in large-scale cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are gonna be a few really big
winners in that market, but there's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot more losers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kinda like playing the end of alcohol
prohibition by buying a hop farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna do really well in the alcohol
industry or in the beer industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't wanna be a farmer, you don't
wanna own the hop farms, you wanna own
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, you wanna own distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanna own the distributors,
you wanna own the popular brands,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanna own those distribution points,
but the hop farmers are the least
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same ultimately is gonna
be there for cannabis, which makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: brand side, coming back to your original
question, makes the brand side so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, the feedstock that
goes into that brand is gonna be really
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than your really high-end
artisan cultivators, like the absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: best to the best, the prices for raw
material and the prices for raw flour is
[SPEAKER_01]: really gonna drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But brands tend to hold their value quite
a bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the value of those brands will
come down as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in different kinds of infused products
brands, so edibles and vape pens and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else, those will hold their
value a bit more than the raw material and
[SPEAKER_01]: the flours themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think establishing a really good
brand now that can go state to state to
[SPEAKER_01]: state to state and establishes a following
for that brand in multiple states across
[SPEAKER_01]: the country is gonna be particularly
valuable when the rails come down on
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate commerce, because those brands
are gonna then be able to buy their
[SPEAKER_01]: product a lot cheaper, to create their
product a lot cheaper and to ship
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere around the country a lot
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the value of their brands,
while it will come down some, will hold
[SPEAKER_01]: its value a lot better than the raw
flours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now getting into that licensing
game and making sure that you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you can to maximize the
exposure of your brand, I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're gonna wanna have those
distribution channels, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If your brands become important,
but being able to distribute those through
[SPEAKER_01]: the distribution channels in the industry,
also becomes incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that you get into those
distribution channels today, if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: product manufacturer, largely is to
license your brand to manufacturers in
[SPEAKER_01]: other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, if you do really well,
maybe you end up acquiring those companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've licensed your brands to down
the road, or you pump way more product
[SPEAKER_01]: through those licensors down the road and
increase your revenue that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think that the big time
players are very aware of this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the next level up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm at conventions and at dinner
and talking with these guys who are
[SPEAKER_00]: invested in highly scaling oil product
folk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, we do our product
manufacturing and we are aggressively
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing, but we're not really all that
invested into the production of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, the materials to go into the oil,
because they're all waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: international commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the US to get involved with
international commerce, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not playing in it, because
everyone's waiting to, you know what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be like to have all of this flower
grown in Mexico on inexpensive land with
[SPEAKER_00]: less expensive labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly will have the
intellectual property and talent to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions, and then just ship the
finished product here, where people will
[SPEAKER_00]: plug it into their actual products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you talk about that to somebody
who hasn't really thought that through in
[SPEAKER_00]: their single state business model,
and you can just see their face go pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas other hardcore players,
say for example, in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're already planning on that
happening within the next 15 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they already know what they're gonna
do when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is shocking to
people who haven't considered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the international piece of this is
something that's largely off the radar in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States, but it shouldn't be,
because it's already going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got licenses for large scale
cultivation and oil production in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia, which by the way, is where most
of the cut flower industry gets their
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers from in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean like ornamental flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to your supermarket and you buy
a bouquet of flowers, I mean, chances are
[SPEAKER_01]: those are grown in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the cut flower industry has moved
down there over the last decade or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're buying greenhouse produced
cucumbers or tomatoes or peppers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, chances are those are
produced somewhere in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible they're produced in Southern
Arizona, but most of that was produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico, and you're starting to see the
rest of the world catch on to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the idea that large scale cannabis
is gonna be grown in warehouses in Ohio is
[SPEAKER_01]: just silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that when we look at what's
going on in the international scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got Canadian companies that are
building out a million and a half square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet of greenhouse space to supposedly
supply the global market in places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine that in the medium term,
they're gonna be able to compete with
[SPEAKER_01]: places like Mexico or Colombia or
Macedonia or Bulgaria or North Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: all places that are big agricultural
regions outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you think about who's gonna supply
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Canada doesn't make a whole lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany certainly doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got people investing in massive
greenhouses, houses in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gray in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cold and it's gray in Canada,
and the cost of living and cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: expenses are really, really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would look at like, where is all the
tobacco in Europe grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown from Albania to Macedonia and
Bulgaria into Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you pack a Camels and it
says fine Turkish tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of that's actually grown in Macedonia
and Bulgaria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even grown, some of it's still
grown in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Turkish cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Turkish cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all grown in that, it's the
tobacco belt of Europe and Southeastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's where cannabis will grow more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of living, standard cost of
production, cost of labor there is
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially cheaper than anywhere in
Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same is gonna go for North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a reason why we don't do
large scale commercial agriculture for
[SPEAKER_01]: just about anything in Canada other than
trees, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a great climate for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that to think that these
Canadian companies are gonna wind up being
[SPEAKER_01]: the suppliers for the world, I think is
kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, if you're focused on
building a really large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure for cultivation in most
states in the United States, it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: a tough sell when, first when interstate
commerce opens up, but then also when
[SPEAKER_01]: international commerce opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, outside of, I think there will be
some winners that can do this on a large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale in certain places in California and
certain places in Arizona, Nevada,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can build good economies of
scale where the conditions are right for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even there, I'll give you an anecdote
from the greenhouse produce industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest contiguous greenhouse in North
America, I believe still is actually in
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilcox, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a company called Eurofresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the largest producers of
greenhouse cucumbers, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and peppers in North America, mostly
shipping into the Northern States and
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada in the winter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they were pretty much put out of
business by a very large scale greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: set up in Southern Mexico, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just couldn't compete on price with
massive scale greenhouse production coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Southern Mexico because cost of
labor is so much cheaper down there than
[SPEAKER_01]: it is even in Southern Arizona,
where the atmospheric conditions are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really good for greenhouse
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically, the owner of that greenhouse
in Southern Mexico happens to be the son
[SPEAKER_01]: of a former governor in the state of
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: That greenhouse, like I said, put out of
business the largest greenhouse producer
[SPEAKER_01]: of tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers in
North America in Arizona, and the owner
[SPEAKER_01]: then went and bought one of those
satellite greenhouses, not the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: one, but one of this company's larger
satellite greenhouses in Snowflake,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona, and has now converted that to
being a cannabis greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is now the largest producer of
cannabis in the state of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, the venture capital reacts,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who don't have the same
comparison scale as you have, you said a
[SPEAKER_00]: very large greenhouse in, I think,
Wilcox, Arizona versus another bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in Southern Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many acres would you say each of those
greenhouses were just to give folks some
[SPEAKER_00]: scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me a general idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was like a few square miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw satellite footage of the one in
Wilcox, and you could see there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, a nine-hole golf course on their
property, and it was like one-tenth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it from satellite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at the satellite
footage, you can actually put it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you put in Eurofresh,
Wilcox, Arizona on Google Earth or Google
[SPEAKER_01]: Maps, you can see it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for going down that
international rabbit hole with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to circle us all the way back to
we are talking about the two sides of
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing agreements and negotiating the
contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think that when the licensee goes
to implement the contract that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: set up with the licensor, that they will
often implement it incorrectly,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either because they've not done it before
or because they want to make their own
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the poor implementations of
licensed contracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, and that's where things get
tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually take you back to my earliest
days on the industry side of things here
[SPEAKER_01]: back when I was with a company called
Canby, which was an offshoot of Harborside
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Center as a consulting business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, we were way ahead of our
time at Canby.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were actually in the process of getting
approved to be the first cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: franchisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to franchise a couple of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brands, including Harborside, back then,
before the company went under.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so that's actually where I learned a
lot about what you have to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: franchising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, Harborside Health Center in
Oakland, one of the one of the best known
[SPEAKER_01]: names and biggest dispensaries in the
country, opened their first satellite
[SPEAKER_01]: location in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it initially through a
licensing agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was something that we helped
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be on the consulting side of things
was to help get that new store up and
[SPEAKER_01]: running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they licensed the Harborside brand
and some of the protocols to Harborside
[SPEAKER_01]: San Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the owner was the owner of
Harborside San Jose was a different owner
[SPEAKER_01]: than the owners of Harborside Oakland,
the original store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that owner, I won't name names,
frankly, it's been about a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the name at this point,
but decided that, you know, he wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: do different things with with with the way
Harborside was being run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so early on, you saw small signs like,
you know, he wanted everybody wearing polo
[SPEAKER_01]: shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Harborside brand on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, part of what part of at
least in Steve D'Angelo and the Harborside
[SPEAKER_01]: owner's mind, part of what made Harborside
such a great experience was allowing their
[SPEAKER_01]: employees to express their individuality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have dress codes outside of
you can't wear something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: inappropriate to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they wanted people to be able to
express their individuality, to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: relate better to people who came into the
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, now you've got this
licensee saying, well, we want everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: in a polo shirt and Harborside logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just once it's one small example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of other things like
that where the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I can do better by doing X,
Y and Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it caused some real consternation
amongst the original Harborside owners who
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like, well, this is not our brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this isn't it's not even
necessarily that what they're doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, but this isn't our brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really concerned about the way
that this brand is being implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: because we want to maintain the integrity
of the Harborside brand, something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: put our blood, sweat and tears into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, ultimately, it was a it was
a little bit of an ugly fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: To to get control of that band back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't go into that or I won't go
into the details of what happened because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was, you know, there was a little
bit of ugliness there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, by and large, in the end,
the Harborside owners were able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that back and they ended up, you know,
they ended up I don't know whether it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a buyout or exactly how it was structured,
but basically took took that control of
[SPEAKER_01]: that San Jose store and operated it as a
company owned store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so essentially a real satellite
Harborside rather than a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: Harborside because they just felt that
through a licensing agreement like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't going to be able to maintain
the integrity of their brand as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: they could if they were operating
themselves or they could if they were
[SPEAKER_01]: franchising it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, you know, that really wasn't an
option at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one more question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you have given a lot of
advice both in how you want to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing your license, but how also
not how to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sure that when you when you
are, you know, at conventions like I am
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're overhearing people talking
about their their their efforts to license
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes you hear something cringe
and you know, you hear something that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you cringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've heard a lot of those things
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is one good piece of advice that
you can offer people who are seeking to
[SPEAKER_00]: license their brand outside their
origination state that they may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about and you hope to God they do
think about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I think the two big things and
we've hit on both of these at various
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, the two big things that jump
out at me is, number one, have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good corporate attorney with experience in
franchise law, even if you're just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing to make sure you're not running
a foul of accidental franchise laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll make sure things are papered up
really, really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be able to protect your
brand, you have to have a good a good
[SPEAKER_01]: contract that you can that you can rely on
to, you know, as much as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a litigious person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have a good attorney from
the very beginning to help you set this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing up, right, to help you structure it
the right way, to help you write your
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that having having having a good
attorney there is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing is make sure
you're really comfortable with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're licensing to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do as much diligence as you possibly
can on the principals and the managers of
[SPEAKER_01]: the company that you're licensing to,
you know, really dig deep into who they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, talk about, you know, talk about
their past business experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for references, ask to talk to people
that they've worked with in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask if they've done licensing agreements
and how those have gone in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't you don't just rush into a
deal because you really want to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: state and you found somebody who's willing
to pay you the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, if you wind up in bed
with the wrong person, it can be really
[SPEAKER_01]: painful and a really expensive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really, really want to do your
diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you really want to feel comfortable
because ultimately you're entrusting your
[SPEAKER_01]: brand or your protocols to this person and
this company potentially for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a decade or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make sure that they're
going to do right by it, that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to bring disrepute to your brand,
which ultimately will reflect negatively
[SPEAKER_01]: on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when it comes down to it,
the consumer doesn't know if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a brand in one state versus another
state, the consumer doesn't know whether
[SPEAKER_01]: that was licensed or whether that was
produced by the same company that produced
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the first state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if somebody does something wrong
with your brand and brings some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: disrepute, to your brand, that reflects on
your brand all around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can deal with some of that through
litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could deal with some of that through
contracts if you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole point is to not get there in
the first place, not have to do that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of damage control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way you can do that is to
make sure that you're really, really
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with whoever you're going to
be working with and thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing your brand or your protocols to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you really hit on the point
solidly when you say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that this is a long term
relationship, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good advice for folks when
they're looking at somebody to date and to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a long term relationship with,
you know, choose somebody who fights in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you feel reasonable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like, if you date somebody who
fights fair or fights dirty, you very well
[SPEAKER_00]: could end up with a really ugly breakup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get into a relationship with
somebody who is at least respectful enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can fight fairly, if you do break
up, chances are it won't necessarily be
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it surprises me sometimes when I meet
these folks who are aggressively
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're working on three or four
or five state deals at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I understand their priority
that they want to quick, get them done so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a busy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, this is a serious
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always recommend that, you know,
you go to the state, you meet with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to, you know, try to have more than
dinner, you know, try to do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, because you can learn a lot about
the communication of the other management
[SPEAKER_00]: team by how they speak to their spouse or
the rental car that they choose to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: or how they handle who's paying the check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really simple things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all pick up on, oh, all right,
I see how they would be under stress
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is how they are in their
normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people figure,
ah, well, you know, we're all papered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, I'm protected legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell them, you know, you really need
to get some more FaceTime with these
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you really are getting into a
relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're, you know, if you're at
the point where you're having to enforce
[SPEAKER_01]: legal agreements, you're already at a
really painful point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole point is to not get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, you can have really good
contracts and really good legal
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an unscrupulous person on
the other side, it could be really painful
[SPEAKER_01]: and really expensive, even if you
ultimately wind up winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I say once you get to the point
where you're in a lawsuit or you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: arbitration with somebody, the only
winners there are the attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody else involved, it's really
painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You usually wind up settling where,
you know, nobody's really happy with the
[SPEAKER_01]: way things came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your advice to spend time with
them and see how they interact with things
[SPEAKER_01]: is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything you can do to get somebody
under stress and see how they respond to
[SPEAKER_01]: stress before you get into that
relationship with them, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: business relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that goes for licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes for partnerships, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: JVs, any of these things are really
important because it's easy to get along
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody when everything's going fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking about all the
money you're going to make together and
[SPEAKER_01]: the deal you're going to do together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, everything's great until
stress hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you see people's true
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that note, you know, I actually
think one of the one of the better ways
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is going to sound a bit may sound
a bit odd, but one of the better ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how somebody deals with stress and
particularly stress in an adversary
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship is actually through a tough
contract negotiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through the negotiation for the
licensing agreement itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I think you don't
necessarily want to rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is the one time when you are
actually adversarial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go from, you know, you meet
somebody, you talk about we should do some
[SPEAKER_01]: business together, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's rosy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves the idea, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not adversarial at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really happy together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's kind of like the,
you know, the honeymoon dating phase.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then you got to get things
papered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start bringing lawyers in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's provisions of contracts
that they're not going to like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's provisions you're not going to
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's push and pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is inherently adversarial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always found this to be a little
bit odd because you go from everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: great to all of a sudden we're on opposite
sides and we're each pushing for what's in
[SPEAKER_01]: our own interests as opposed to the other
person's interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as that's done,
you're in the boat together and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's good again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're on the same team again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this weird interim time when
you're negotiating that contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: When if you, you know, if you do make it a
real negotiation, you get a window into
[SPEAKER_01]: how somebody is going to respond in an
adversarial stressful relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually had situations where
I've been in contract negotiations with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody and ultimately said, you know
what, not interested in doing this deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, the, the dollars and cents are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, the, the, anything else
lines up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you guys are a holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but you've been a nightmare to
deal with in all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to happen when we have a
disagreement over the business,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is a nightmare, that's going to be
even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think you can learn a lot from
contracting about how someone's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get a bad feeling about like,
I just don't like the way these guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: handling that you should probably walk
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
