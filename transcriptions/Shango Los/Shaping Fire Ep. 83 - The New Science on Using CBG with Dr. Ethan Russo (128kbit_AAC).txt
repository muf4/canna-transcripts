[SPEAKER_01]: We all love THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It consoles us when we are hurt,
it soothes our pain when we are injured,
[SPEAKER_01]: it opens our mind and gives us big
thoughts, and it makes us better humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: When CBD, cannabidiol, entered our
awareness in the early 2000s, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: caregivers and patients quickly learned of
the incredible benefits that CBD had on an
[SPEAKER_01]: array of ailments because it interacted so
effectively with the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I speak to patient groups around the
country, there is usually someone in the
[SPEAKER_01]: group who has some version of,
how can CBD help so many medical problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about it like it's a magical
potion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true that the list of physical
problems that CBD helps with seems
[SPEAKER_01]: unrealistic, but I tell folks that CBD
really only helps one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It supports and strengthens the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The healing gained is because the
endocannabinoid system is the body's
[SPEAKER_01]: master regulator for all the major
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you help the master regulator,
you keep your body more in balance and
[SPEAKER_01]: lessen the impact of a wide range of
ailments simply because you have gassed up
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulating mechanism and it can now do
its job more effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the popularity of CBD, new research
is now just beginning into several other
[SPEAKER_01]: novel cannabinoids, including CBG,
cannabigerol, and CBG2 acts as a system
[SPEAKER_01]: wide through the endocannabinoid system in
similar ways as CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG has many benefits for folks looking to
get relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we're going to dig into the
first scientific survey of what ailments
[SPEAKER_01]: patients are using CBG to relieve.

[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, he pursued a three month
sabbatical doing ethnobotanical research
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous people in Peru.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is author of several books of cannabis
medicine and has published over 30
[SPEAKER_01]: articles in neurology, pain management,
cannabis and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Russo has joined us before on shaping
fire.

new paper on cannabis hyper emesis
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome and of course the 10 part video
series shaping fire sessions on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we offer Dr. Russo's very first
public interview on the results of his
[SPEAKER_01]: groundbreaking paper out this week titled
survey of patients employing Abigiral
[SPEAKER_01]: predominant cannabis preparations,
perceived medical effects, adverse events
[SPEAKER_01]: and withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk mostly about this
new comprehensive survey that you and your
[SPEAKER_01]: co-authors have published.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do that, let's spend the
first set in talking specifically about
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG so that everybody understands a little
more significantly the impact of the
[SPEAKER_01]: survey when we get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, while CBG is only really
getting popular now, when did we first
[SPEAKER_01]: discover and isolate Cannabigiral and knew
that it existed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that goes clear back to 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with many other items pertinent to
cannabis and cannabinoid science,
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Misholem was there with his
partner, Yehiel Gaoni, who died I think
[SPEAKER_00]: three years ago at about age 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they isolated Cannabigiral in 1964
from hashish that was seized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: government and it was of Lebanese origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, as is so often the case,
Professor Misholem was very prescient
[SPEAKER_00]: about what might happen and he called
Cannabigiral the missing link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's synthesis of cannabinoid
constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knew right away that this was sort
of the mother of all cannabinoids was the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor to the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turned out to be absolutely
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the reason that he determined
it was the mother of cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in looking at the chemistry,
it seemed that other things would be
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine that this was based on the
structure
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, I don't know how he did it,
but he turned out to be right in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Misholem realizes that this is a
significant discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, there's this big
period where there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we attribute that to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that directly related to prohibition or
was like nobody really interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, combination of a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First was prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, cannabis was already illegal
most places and then more formally so with
[SPEAKER_00]: a single convention treaty, which followed
a few years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main reason was all the bandwidth
was taken up by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because in initial studies,
which took place in 1969, they started
[SPEAKER_00]: giving cannabigerals to dogs, monkeys,
mice and rats and didn't see any really
[SPEAKER_00]: overt behavioral changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just didn't get any attention
until much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the days like that,
they would have been giving them CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not in the company of other
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there'd be small amounts that
might be present if someone were using
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish or other forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the quirks and this could be
another reason that it wasn't studied so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, CBG doesn't accumulate much in
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of is a high throughput stop on
the way to the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, as soon as it's made most
frequently, the plant goes on to THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with selective breeding,
that situation is changing and we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: to that more later, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you mean high throughput
stoppage?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is how you put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, so there are enzymes that
result in the production of cannabigeral
[SPEAKER_00]: or actually cannabigerolic acid,
which is what the plant makes before
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation, the loss of CO2 molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, normally it doesn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more enzymes that will lead to
production of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in most cannabis samples,
when they're analyzed, you see either no
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG or very small amounts, well,
well under 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we know about
the variety of cannabinoids that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: researched is that they work on different
receptors in different ways, which kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: suggests what they might be used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the different actions and
receptors that CBG acts on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it similar to any of the other
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are some overlaps in terms
of the things that it seems to be good
[SPEAKER_00]: for, which we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But straight out of the chute,
it's important to mention that CBG does
[SPEAKER_00]: not seem to work directly on the
cannabinoid receptors, at least not CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: and CB2, which are normally associated
with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's true to say that it is not
intoxicating or doesn't produce a high the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that THC does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, early on, that led to less
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it leads to more interest
because of all the benefits it can have
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutically without the possible
downside of intoxication, because being
[SPEAKER_00]: high, as you know, is considered a side
effect, according to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to answer your question, it does work
on adrenoreceptors, alpha-2
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may have something to do with its
effects on pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it's an antagonist at what's
called the TRIP-M8 receptor, which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it a good candidate for a number of
things, particularly treatment of prostate
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, but also overactive bladder and a
variety of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are lots of other
activities where all of it hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, its activity at CB1 and
CB2 is much, much less than THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, and all these mechanisms
aren't clear yet, but back in 2008,
[SPEAKER_00]: Giovanni Appendino and his colleagues
discovered that CBG is very powerful as an
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria,
and that includes MRSA,
[SPEAKER_00]: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, which is associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital-acquired infections and some
years ago was responsible for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the, excuse me, as far as the
fact that we haven't really had consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: access to CBG, until we've developed these
more CBG-dominant plants, most folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to kind of generally have the
belief that land races had wide-ranging
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties of cannabinoids until they
became heavily bred for the THC market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is that breeding for THC that you
mentioned that bred the CBG out because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was taking up space in the resin gland
that could be holding THC instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen much evidence, either
through your research or through your work
[SPEAKER_01]: with Breeders Best, that there were
CBG-dominant land races prior to starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed it for THC heavily?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say is that where people have
been growing with regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, real soil, active
mycorrhizae, natural bacteria in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seeing a greater diversity of
cannabinoid production, including CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, chemovars, chemical
varieties that previously were primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or CBD, seem to be expressing more
different cannabinoids, including CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're grown in this fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the premise of your question is a real
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the problem is we don't know,
didn't have great analytical capabilities
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to the early 70s when there
were more land races available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm sure you're aware, a lot of
those have been supplanted by seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: California and the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's getting harder to find some of
the old land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a great topic for future
research, something I'd like to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer better in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is disappointing that so many of
those original land race populations have
[SPEAKER_01]: been infected by worked over lines from
the West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do hope that people put more effort into
saving those land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a side note, I find that very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting too, that you're finding
the expression of CBG and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: various cannabinoids is more prevalent in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the other episodes we've done,
that would make sense too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant has got a wider relationship
with the soil and the plant is sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates with the microbe life in the
rhizosphere, allowing a wider variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: life, thus feeding the plant from below
all those delightful excretions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil, it would make sense that the
plant has got more raw material to express
[SPEAKER_01]: itself more wildly, which is why plants
that are grown in soil have got a wider
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile than otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would make sense that folks who are
growing intentionally for CBG would want
[SPEAKER_01]: to strongly consider soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBG is often called a novel or minor
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most cases, that seems to be
synonymous with not studied much,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do those words novel or minor cannabinoid
have any relevance in science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, novel is a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minor really refers to the fact that we
usually don't see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's a situation we'd like to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that CBG is the next big
thing and maybe in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not referring to it as a minor
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a case to be made that really
the words novel and minor are more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: layman's terms and not actually all that
legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Novel to me just means, you know,
I hadn't heard of that one so much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a situation that we need to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was surprised to read in your paper
that CBG actually often occurs or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: not often, but occurs elsewhere in nature
other than in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you please teach us a bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear back in 1979, there was an article
that was published in German from a German
[SPEAKER_00]: group and they were looking at so-called
South African daisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found small amounts of both
cannabigerolic acid and cannabigerol in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mainly an analytical article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you really dig, it gets
interesting because this plant and related
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the genus were sometimes smoked
by indigenous people in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of detail about the
effects, but presumably there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Europeans would often look
at this and claim that these things were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked as a tobacco substitute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when people didn't have
tobacco to smoke, they'd smoke these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's culturally myopic,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that my suspicion is that it had
an anti-anxiety effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it was being smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some evidence for that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amounts were small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an article that I knew of and
actually paid to have it translated into
[SPEAKER_00]: English because I'm not a German reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it didn't provide a lot of
detail about the uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, my colleague Mark Lewis
looked at some plants that we germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very hard to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he really found only tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unlikely, without a tremendous
amount of selective breeding, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get significant concentrations of
these molecules from that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot more sense to selectively
breed cannabis where we can do a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can have a geral production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the second set, we're going to talk
more about, you know, what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting in the modern day as human users
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before your survey, the largest survey
of users that has occurred, looking
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards, we were looking at animal
studies primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some suspicions of what we
were going to find the positive uses of it
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you do a review of what we were
suspecting when we headed towards studying
[SPEAKER_01]: human use because of what we've learned
from the animal studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, so the early studies,
they just didn't see a lot of overt
[SPEAKER_00]: behavioral changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was some work showing a
benefit on pain reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were studies that showed decreasing
of the intraocular pressure, much as THC
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were effects to reduce reddening
that were associated with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: More interesting were some cytotoxic
effects, in other words, effects against
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was true in what's called
epithelioid carcinoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, again, in prostate cancer and
breast cancer, there was also a prominent
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some rodent work done showing an
antidepressant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reduction of cells called
keratinocytes that are present excessively
[SPEAKER_00]: in psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that indicated possible use there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, an interesting one is CPG also works
on another receptor, a nuclear receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that affects gene transcription called
PPAR gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in experiments that were done a couple
of years ago, there was shown to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective effect in inflammation and
also effects on another agent called tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis factor alpha that's involved in
autoimmune disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it opens up a lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, there was a recent study just
this year in glublastoma multiforme
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that basically canapigeral could
kill that kind of cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, very promising, particularly
since without giving anything away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can say that canapigeral is a very
nontoxic substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely we could give large amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to treat cancer
successfully without introducing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other toxicities, in other words,
side effects, is going to be a real boon
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future because currently available
chemotherapy agents are generally toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you hope that you kill the
cancer before you kill too many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient's normal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why standard chemotherapy is
associated with loss of hair follicles and
[SPEAKER_00]: sloughing the gut and canapigeral and
other cannabinoids pretend to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: safer as chemotherapeutic agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious what you mean using the term
that's relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give much more CBG, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For many folks, a regular dose is going to
be somewhere between probably 10 and 20
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams, maybe down to five,
but probably 10 to 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you say much more, what are you
actually saying milligrams-wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with some of the cannabinoids,
it may be necessary to have hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, at least, and I don't want anyone
pressing their luck, but we've got so
[SPEAKER_00]: little indication of toxicity from the
information we have, it's very likely that
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of high doses could be given
without the kinds of drawbacks that we
[SPEAKER_00]: find with huge doses of THC, where
certainly people can attain them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but often they have to do it by titrating
upwards over a period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what we know so far, my strong
suspicion is that high doses of CBG will
[SPEAKER_00]: be tolerable to people that might need
higher doses to treat cancer primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've worked with patients that are
taking as much as 250 a day, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly don't seem to have any negative
side effects unless not having any anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: is a side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this last question before we go to the
break, it's a little personal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that it's called for regarding
what you've just said about the history of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a research scientist who also has
worked in a general practice so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are used to interacting with real humans
who are really suffering, and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: just only in the lab where people are
sometimes less connected to the patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you feel about the frustration of
having your hands tied for so long and
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to research something that you
just stated?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had really good ideas that is going
to help people for so long, but no one's
[SPEAKER_01]: really had the opportunity to touch it,
and now having that opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as someone who's a lifelong
researcher for you, it must be somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: like a frustrating opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think frustration is my middle
name where cannabis comes in because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this has been my life for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But frankly, the situation with
prohibition on cannabigerol is outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scandalous and scientifically
untenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certain that when drug abuse liability
studies are done, they're just not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a signal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be that it's one of the solutions
to addiction, but it won't be a cause of
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's guilt by association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens to come from a plant that also
happens to make THC, which similarly
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an outrageous situation,
and the longer it goes on, the greater the
[SPEAKER_00]: tragedy will be compounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing that the ability to do this
kind of research has been eased?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've told me just in passing,
you've told me in passing that even doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this survey is hard, and you're just
asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the state of play as far as doing
CBG studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, technically, CBG is a
schedule one forbidden substance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people could be arrested for it under
federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has not changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrespective of the fact that it's legal
in many states, it would be possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be prosecuted just for having
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that hasn't changed, and the roadblocks
to research remain essentially no
[SPEAKER_00]: different substantially from what I
experienced back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez, so that's the frustrating
opportunity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, another reason I've worked for
foreign companies for most of the past 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm excited to hear what the survey
shows us, but let's go ahead and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: first commercial break out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire,
and my guest today is cannabis researcher
[SPEAKER_01]: and neurologist Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis folks are innovators and problem
solvers, and we like to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you developed a tool, technique,
or plant that you want to protect and
[SPEAKER_01]: monetize?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll likely want legal representation
that is experienced, accessible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and shares your values.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant and planet law represents a wide
variety of clients who choose to respect
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment while pursuing their
business goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you invented a machine or gizmo that
you're bringing to market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you discover a breakthrough
environmentally friendly pesticide or
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer formulation that you're about
to start selling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you bred a cannabis plant with
attributes not found anywhere else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Attorney Dale Hunt and his plant and
planet team have established genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: patents in over 30 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working to help entrepreneur scientists
throughout the life sciences, plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: planet represents environmentally positive
clients in cannabis and other botanicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, water purification, clean energy,
emulsion, and medical applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant and planet helps people protect what
they've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are an early stage company with an
established idea and are in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: fundraising, often the investors require
intellectual property protections happen
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant and planet can be your sole
representation, or they can integrate with
[SPEAKER_01]: your existing legal team and plug in their
specialties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant and planet is made of scientists,
lawyers with a real passion for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: inventions, and the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the scientific and legal depth
to help you establish patent protections
[SPEAKER_01]: for your great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendly, qualified, and honorable legal
representation is available to you.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's plant and planet law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our clients make the planet better.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a replacement for using peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_01]: container growing, but organic growers
know that peat moss is an unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: resource, and the mining of peat bogs
destroys habitat and releases sequestered
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that shares the
[SPEAKER_01]: same benefits while also being
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems, it actually is made from
upcycled organic paper and tree bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption, and water
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades-long
[SPEAKER_01]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss has the fluffy nature of peat
moss and handles exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like peat moss, pit moss is inert,
so it won't change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient-enhanced blend,
[SPEAKER_01]: a coco coir blend, and also as an organic
soil conditioner with no added nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to pitmoss.com now to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's P-I-T-T-M-O-S-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: P-I-T-M-O-S-S.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing healthier, more sustainable
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons why no-till cannabis
growing is so valued by farmers is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium networks in the soil remain
established from year to year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these fungal networks are
essential because they are the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: superhighways that extend far and wide in
the substrate to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trouble with growing in new living
soils or blended coco substrates is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes most of the plant's life just to
create these mycelium highways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal fungi inoculant
reduces that time and gets your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: eating a wider array of nutrients faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's three times the concentration of
the other popular brand in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: at 900 propagules per gram of two fungal
species selected specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is the result of 30 years of
research and trials at the Volkani
[SPEAKER_01]: Agricultural Research Institute in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has also been vigorously trialed by
cannabis and food growers across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco is now available at grow shops
and on Amazon in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Dynomyco to both speed up the
growth of the mycelium networks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but also as a biostimulant to make
clone cuttings more virile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see side-by-sides showing the
comparative growth on their Instagram at
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you demand reliable growing results and
appreciate the importance of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone in creating a thriving plant,
I encourage you to check out Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: and use the store locator to find out
where you can get yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's D-Y-N-O-M-Y-C-O.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaping Fire listeners can get 10% off any
size of Dynomyco on Amazon or Dynomyco.com
[SPEAKER_01]: by using the discount code shapingfire,
one word, no cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you are starting with new beds or
pots, or if you want to add some zing to
[SPEAKER_01]: tired soil, choose Dynomyco to maximize
your plant's potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynomyco endomycorrhizal inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los, and our guest
this week is cannabis researcher and
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologist Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during this set, we're going to focus
specifically on this survey with a title
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of the paper is Survey of
Patients Employing Cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_01]: Predominant Cannabis Preparations,
Perceived Medical Effects, Adverse
[SPEAKER_01]: Effects, and Withdrawal Symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pretty much know what the agenda is
here in the second set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ethan, you got a handful of co-authors
on this study, and everyone put in hard
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like us to take the opportunity to
give them a nod, if you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was a real labor of love and
involved three universities, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Credo Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my idea to do this, but I
immediately wanted to enlist the help of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kerry Cutler on the Department of
Psychology at Washington State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was fantastic in putting this together
and really implementing the survey,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we decided what to ask jointly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of that work was also informed
by Michelle Sexton at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also enlisted the aid of another great
researcher, Ziva Cooper at UCLA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and grad student Amanda Stoiber,
who works with Kerry, was involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as my business partner,
Nisha Whiteley at Credo Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the great fortune to be involved
with five wonderful women in doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, and it all went very smoothly from
our standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who funded this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, essentially, Kerry and
the rest volunteered their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, same with us at Credo Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offered two gift cards as an incentive
to participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cost me personally a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who were recruited,
you paid for the raffle everybody was in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assumed that since this was being done
in cooperation with universities,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the way it always happens is that the
university foots the bill for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess that's an incorrect
understanding on my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it generally would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, clearly, Kerry and other people
work through grants, but sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: grants offer latitude in how you spend
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this was not funded by the
National Institutes of Health directly or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then let's move right into the
survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to kind of like hand you
the mic because so that you can go through
[SPEAKER_01]: your notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you explain for us how the survey
was set up and operated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, the study was exempted from
what's called the Institutional Review
[SPEAKER_00]: Board.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at it and decided that we
weren't going to do anything that would
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with the anonymity of
participants or expose them to the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had free rein to take people through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recruited people online with
listservs, social media, and some personal
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts and had some help there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survey was placed online, and there
were certain things we wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: To avoid issues, we made it adults only,
age 21 or up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be an American resident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to, and this was the
important part, they had to be using a
[SPEAKER_00]: nabegero predominant product, meaning at
least 50% CBG in the past six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we asked a bunch of questions and
analyzed those statistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the demographics, 166 people
started, but 127 completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get bored or decide they don't want
to do it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about 34% males and 40% females,
predominantly Caucasian, some diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a range of income and education,
but unlike some surveys of medical use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, where there are a lot of people
who are disabled or unemployed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of the people who took part
were working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we examined was the use
patterns for the cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all predominant products.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had averaged taking these for a
little bit over nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't, oh, you know, I tried it
once, and this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we had a better foundation of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people were using flour, they
averaged about three and a half grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who were using
concentrates, it was about a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: A gram of CBG concentrates per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we wanted to know why people took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, what conditions were they
treating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there were probably,
boy, I didn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must have been 40 or 50 things that
were mentioned, and some people had more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point being that over half,
51.2% were using CBG for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 6.3% characterized the use as
recreational, and about 36.2% called it
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a common situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly one could argue that all use has
a medical basis, but that's how people
[SPEAKER_00]: judge this themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common conditions that were cited
by the population involved were anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: 51.2%, chronic pain, which was 40.9%,
depression, 33.1%, and insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty sleeping in 30.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is all based on 127 people
who completed the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're using cannabidiol
predominant products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing we wanted to examine was
how did they compare cannabidiol with
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional medicines that might be used
to treat the same conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, they seem to think
that this worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Majority of the conditions, people said
that they were much or very much improved
[SPEAKER_00]: as compared to prior to taking
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest efficacy was associated with
endometriosis, gynecological condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: 66.7% cited that as being helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one I didn't necessarily expect,
inflammatory bowel disease, 75%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and irritable bowel syndrome, 82.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly people with gastrointestinal
issues found this quite helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's really interesting to me was
not a single person thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional medicine was superior to CBG
for these various conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not a single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really makes you wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that some people probably
think, oh, you know, again, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're high, but they weren't high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the usual disclaimer that you
sometimes hear about in relation to THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're high and they don't care about
their condition anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's clearly just not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another measure of efficacy of a medicine
is what does it allow you to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, were people discontinuing
conventional medicines?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a significant number of people
who discontinued conventional medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the use of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly true for
antidepressant meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-opioid analgesics, so that would
include things like non-steroidal
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatories, and also protein pump
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they'd be used by people who
had ulcers or that kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we've got the gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemingly a lot of affinity there for that
kind of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, again, one of the main reasons
we did this is finding out what it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, you know, we wanted to
establish this because I expect that CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: on CBG predominant products, eventually
are going to be going into clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to establish a pattern on
number one of what's it good for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and number two, is it safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly that was one of the primary
reasons we wanted to do this, this survey
[SPEAKER_00]: to lay a foundation for future more
in-depth randomized controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting idea, especially
with how you described the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for trying to do this sort of
research that, if I understand you
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, you kind of had to do this
study first so that you can now go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the well and do a more complex,
deeper study, because without this study,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would not be able to get a heavier
duty study even approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can relate a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, it was not that many
years ago that my colleague, Donald
[SPEAKER_00]: Abrams, wanted to do a study looking at
inhaled cannabidiol, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first reaction from the FDA was,
well, we don't have a record of human use
[SPEAKER_00]: in this fashion, which really wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD had been extensively investigated as
part of Sativex and epixomals in clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew all we needed to know about is
safety for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, he had to put together
information showing that CBD was
[SPEAKER_00]: extensively available in California and
elsewhere, and that hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of people were using it with no major
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was able to proceed with the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you have to look at these
things and wonder what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: the next round with the next new,
quote unquote, cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really anticipated that there would
be pushback about proposed CBG studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, say drugs really new,
a new chemical entity, something you
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal procedure is to test it in
animals and do advanced toxicology studies
[SPEAKER_00]: where huge amounts are given to rats and
or dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if there are no major problems,
you get to give it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the amounts of CBG in the past were
probably low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we wanted to establish a
pattern of use by humans without apparent
[SPEAKER_00]: problems so that we hopefully will not
face the same kind of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a difficulty finding,
you know, the 166 people who started but
[SPEAKER_01]: then like the 127 that finished?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as somebody who works closely
with CBG, I know that finding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CBG dominant products or flour
that are 51% or more CBG, that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's not a common
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you find as far as like being
able to recruit people who had access to
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a challenge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, most of the people came
from the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really been here in the world
where there's been the most intensive
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of CBG predominant varieties
and the greatest interest in its
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't take us forever to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was quite gratified with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing was we had very good
contacts on trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, among others, we sent this to
our colleagues that see the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: number of patients for cannabis
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are accessing CBG
predominant products and it came together
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that you mentioned that
it's prevalent most in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest for the interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything that came up in the
research that give you anything to
[SPEAKER_01]: attribute that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my only bet would be because the
Crawford brothers are in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've been the prime movers for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other braiders that have
independently bred CBG predominant
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and interest is increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we in the Northwest are really
at the center of interest in this
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked this question not as an
indictment, simply as a neutral question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how should we weigh the scientific
validity of self-reporting in this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a lot about conducting
scientific research, but self-reporting
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like something that should be at
least considered for accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know it counts as actual science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, in the hierarchy of
medical proof, a survey doesn't get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of credence.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this instance, we had good
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had specificity with, again,
not the idea that one percent CBG was
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were CBG predominant products being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we saw consistency in the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it would be different if
this were something that people took
[SPEAKER_00]: because they liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, where people could claim
that, well, you know, people use regular
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because they like THC and like
being high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just wasn't the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we had consistency in the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've talked about the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to include the bad, such as it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it turned out, there wasn't a lot
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty-four percent of people in the survey
reported no adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, no significant side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most common were things that might have
been due to THC that was in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dry mouth, sleepiness, increased
appetite and dry eyes, all of which could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been THC induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, although we were asking
about adverse events, 10 percent reported
[SPEAKER_00]: of other side benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the list, it's not an
extensive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were not reporting anything really
dangerous like paranoia or hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also wanted to ask about
withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you've been taking this for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened when you stopped?
[SPEAKER_00]: But 84.3 percent reported no withdrawal
symptoms of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were very, very few who reported
sleep difficulties when they came.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't quit as compared to non-CBG
predominant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, garden variety cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were very marked statistically
significant differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, when people stopped,
they had many fewer issues, if any,
[SPEAKER_00]: as compared to other types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clear again, this isn't addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting people high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not producing significant withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got a quick question about the
definition of withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a regular CBG user and it does a
wonderful job decreasing my anxiety and
[SPEAKER_01]: softening my ADHD.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when I haven't had it for a few
days, some of the sharper edges of those
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of me come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not that I'm having withdrawal
symptoms from the supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because without the supplement,
my brain's a lot clankier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a definitional difference between
withdrawal and just missing the cannabis?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've asked the exactly right
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference between withdrawal
and a recrudescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reappearance of symptoms that
were present before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So withdrawal would be more the idea of
something's worse than it was before or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that wasn't there at all before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Withdrawal and other drugs would also lead
to craving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't hear about craving to speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or obsessive behavior to reacquire the
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that one would associate with,
say, opioid addiction where people
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately turn to crime to obtain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no pink elephants or things we
associate with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: No DTs, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of the people, I know you've already
given us the numbers of the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that the cannabis was more
effective for their ailment than the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical treatments that they were
taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any sense of how many people,
you know, they had an opportunity to have
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG and they saw it worked and they were
not interested in the pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they couldn't find more because
CBG seems to still be spotty right in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid we just don't have that kind of
information yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, hopefully supplies will be
available in the future and this won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, from a scientific
point of view, we're looking at this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation towards much more sophisticated
studies that are going to be in the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches of that hierarchy of medical
proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, anything short of a randomized
controlled trial with comparative placebo
[SPEAKER_00]: is not given a lot of credence by
physicians or the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to need to
really prove, if you will, that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a valuable medical system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a beautiful transition,
Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because during the third set, we're going
to talk about looking forward for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of CBG and how best we folks can
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and take our second
short break and be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is cannabis researcher
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologist, Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_01]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copert Biological Systems has the
beneficial insects, mites and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials, sticky cards and air
distribution units you need to partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature to defend your garden.

[SPEAKER_01]: For 20 years, Humboldt Seed Company has
been family-owned in providing reliable,
[SPEAKER_01]: high-yielding seeds originating in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the current trend is to slap one
super male into a line of hype strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company continues to breed
with precision and care by doing large
[SPEAKER_01]: sifts and back-crosses to emphasize the
absolute best traits that a line has to
[SPEAKER_01]: offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of breeding takes time,
talent, and space to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what kind of aroma you are
particularly into, Humboldt Seed will
[SPEAKER_01]: likely have something you'll love.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you love fruit, you can choose from
banana, mango, apricot, papaya,
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, blood orange, melon,
and lemons across their various strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all-gas, glue, and classic sour
diesel lines as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are the Heritage
California strains like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Hare, and Headband, and their
award-winning blueberry muffin is one that
[SPEAKER_01]: delights just about everybody's palate,
especially when concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company is proud to bring to
market the infamous freak show,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivar II, which has a great THC high,
but looks so much like a fern that some
[SPEAKER_01]: folks can't even identify it as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant that really needs to be seen
to be believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for well-balanced CBD
seeds, Humboldt Seed Company can turn you
[SPEAKER_01]: on to CBD strains that actually have
flavor, like the dill and pepper terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: of Willie G's Lebanese land race.

[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company, let them know
Shango sent ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the national hemp program influx due
to stringent THC testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers Seth and Eric Crawford continue
to release seeds to hemp farmers that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be legal, no matter how you grow them or
when you test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These new varieties from Oregon CBD seeds
have substantial amounts of CBDV,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBGV, CBCV, and THCV, while always staying
below the .3% THC limit and guaranteeing
[SPEAKER_01]: complying crops for farmers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these new varieties cannot be
pollinated by your neighbor's uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen or a rogue male in your own crop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds are non-GMO certified
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD seeds was founded and funded in
2015 by Seth and Eric maxing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: personal credit cards without outside
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They continued to refuse outside
investment that would change their company
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD grows tons of fresh food on
their research farms for local food banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally tons of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also give away tens of thousands of
pounds of R&D flour to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As their company began to succeed,
Seth and Eric started donating money to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis medicine and hemp fiber cause
too by giving millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon State University in order to
establish the world's leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics research program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they treat their employees right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon CBD pays for full health and dental
coverage for their employees, a 401k
[SPEAKER_01]: program, and their minimum starting wage
is 20 bucks an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everyone shares food from the farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth has been on shaping fire a few times
to talk about novel cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out episodes 25 and 37 on
CBD cultivars and the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 66 on triploid cannabis genetics
and the very first shaping fire live
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 47 with Seth and soil expert,
Jeff Lowenfels talking about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a hemp farmer and you want to
grow reliable seeds that are sure to
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive in past testing, check out
oregoncbdseeds.com to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds for the 2021 season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oregoncbdseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our guest this week is cannabis
researcher and neurologist, Dr. Ethan
[SPEAKER_01]: Russo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, during the first set,
we got a better understanding of what CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: is and a bit about how it is functioning
in the human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the second set,
you know, we essentially talked to like
[SPEAKER_01]: 127 people to find out how CBG is helping
them live better lives and get off of
[SPEAKER_01]: their pharmaceuticals with, you know,
increased side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already also talked about how
the environment for research for CBG is
[SPEAKER_01]: opening, but there's still all these hoops
you've got to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious right now, what show,
what, what areas are showing promise
[SPEAKER_01]: looking forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I know there are,
there are, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: college and graduate students and citizen
scientists and others who are constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the promise in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and perhaps we can either motivate
them or direct them in ways that are most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to bear fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the survey measured the prior use of
the participants and their continued need
[SPEAKER_01]: for 13 different classes of medications
that they appeared to be linked with CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about that a little bit
already saying that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are a lot of people who,
A, preferred it to their pharma and B,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they knew it, they believed it
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the classes of these 13 different
medications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it would seem to point where we
should look at for, for shorter term
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, once again, the best
signal were for non-opioid pain relievers
[SPEAKER_00]: with the opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a highly statistically
significant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be a little different from the
claims that we hear associated with say
[SPEAKER_00]: THC predominant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably, I think the most important
one here is antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a P value, probability value
of 0.02, anything below 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered statistically significant
for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that considering the
number of, the big number of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that we saw listed, that there are
probably many other areas that beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: those where this would be fruitful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we can go back to the basic science
and really see where the signals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if the question would be
what is going to be promising for future
[SPEAKER_00]: indications, I think we have the answers
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as like the, how many people,
what I'm going to is market attraction,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the interesting aspects of
the paper is that, you know, towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, it's all, you know, there's
accessibility and its potential future in
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the fastest mover right now is
the cannabis market and people's interests
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis with, you know, what we're
calling novel cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the statistics go,
does this look like something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be desired by everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on its face to me, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it bear out in the numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when a new thing comes along,
there's always somebody that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest we should put it in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do see certain areas that are
preeminent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm sure you've heard from your
contacts, this seems to be a remarkable
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really distinguishes it from
other drugs is that it does this without
[SPEAKER_00]: being overtly sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most anxiety agents are going to be quite
sedating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many are addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly CBG is not either of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard people say something to me
that's very profound in relation to its
[SPEAKER_00]: use in turning anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is its ability to allow them to
compartmentalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is, you know, whatever was
bothering them, they know it's there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can put it aside and concentrate
on the tasks at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, just not let it
pervasively interfere with their
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's the definition of a good
drug for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allowing people to function better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add a little color to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way that you put that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I hear about that same attribute from
patients, they feel like they've got an
[SPEAKER_01]: increased capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: That their life struggles or challenges or
pain have not decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somehow they feel like they're able to
handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have the capability to meet the
difficulty of the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a way, that's them being able to
compartmentalize it so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there other varieties of anxiety that
you saw pop up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gee, not, we just, the survey could not
have that level of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would come from patient
narratives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we'll have to
supplement in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks that are listening and are
curious, the other things that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: just from people taking them, and
certainly not at a scientific level and
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly only anecdotal, we're also seeing a
decrease in people ruminating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either ruminating first thing in the
morning of all the things that could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially go wrong or ruminating at
night of all the things that potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: did get wrong and rethinking things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for others, that background anxiety
that a lot of people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right there you may have put your
finger on how this has been good for sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: because certainly nobody's going to get to
sleep if they're running through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bad stuff that happened during the day or
all the bad stuff they're facing tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sleep killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding that a lot of the people who
are sensitive to THC and they don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take it at night, because I don't
understand the mechanics behind this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some people who will take as little as
five or 10 milligrams at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: they describe a hangover of sorts and they
don't care for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've found that a lot of the people
who switch over to the CBG, since it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have the THC, in the preparation
at significant numbers, if you're pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: it from hemp, they're still getting to
sleep because the ruminating is gone,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're not using the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and I have talked actually probably
several times on this show about your
[SPEAKER_01]: interest in whole plant compounds as a
preference to using lots of isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that your probably top
choice would be to have a plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: bred and grown specifically with a
particular blend for a certain set of
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments and then creating a whole plant
oil and then giving that to the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the market has not developed the
point yet that those preparations really
[SPEAKER_01]: exist except for small pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on doing with CBG,
what many people did five years ago with
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, where they would make a whole plant
oil, think of it as like an RSO or a FECO
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, people call it in there where
they live, but they prepare a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and then they spike it with CBG
isolate, like people used to spike CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: into a THC RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that whole range
of... Well, certainly it's a legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to treating a disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that CBD also has anti-anxiety
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference being that the doses
required for CBD are a lot higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remains to be seen but it's a good bet
that the combination is going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there'd be other components,
particularly terpenoids that can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly the possibilities for
experimentation are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a situation, fortunately,
even in development of a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis, that this kind of blending
is allowed as long as the material is all
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a legitimate approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know this already because in fact,
Sativex or nubixamols, which is approved
[SPEAKER_00]: in 30 countries, is actually a blend of
two different chemovars, a THC predominant
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovar and a CBD predominant chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same kind of approach could be used
with a CBG predominant chemovar in
[SPEAKER_00]: combination with something else to give
the blend that we wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few states, especially the ones that are
still medical, are having internal policy
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions about whether or not isolate
that has been added to cannabis products
[SPEAKER_01]: should be labeled as such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the kind of product that we just talked
about, a whole plant oil, if it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: spiked with either CBG or CBD or anything
else, that it should be noted on the
[SPEAKER_01]: package that there was isolate added to
it, kind of like a fortified with CBG kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it should be on the label?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe in truth in advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the industry is not
self-policed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality control isn't what it really needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always worry about how it was
produced, whether it was pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it actually was synthetic rather
than derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things are germane on
their things that I think the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that begs the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a show a while back with Greg
Gerdeman about synthetic cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: both the creation of cannabinoids that
we're familiar with like THC and CBD in a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic manner, but also the kind of
synthetic cannabinoids that are used for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing and research in the lab and don't
really have much use outside of the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that you answer that question
makes me super curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter if a cannabinoid,
in this case, CBG, is from the plant or if
[SPEAKER_01]: it is made through a synthetic process?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, it is the same molecule or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it should be, but sometimes these
syntheses will produce byproducts that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be contaminants and potentially
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it has to be the right stereoisomer,
in other words, have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional configuration to have
the same activity as the natural compound
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, it will all need to be cannabis
derived to produce a pharmaceutical that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't considered a combination drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in specific states, such as New
York, any additions have to be cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the law there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is important and
irrespective of what I think, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a requirement in certain
contexts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's finish this on a
positive note there, Ethan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking forward, I know that you are
very attracted to CBG and you are already
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at your next work along the same
line of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you give us a little idea of what
you're going to be doing next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, truth be told, I am associated with
a company called the Endura
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals out of Vancouver,
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBG portends to be a big part of its
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be for two indications that
really weren't picked up to any degree in
[SPEAKER_00]: the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are all based on available past
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, they are treatment of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we mentioned, there are certain cancers
that when they're metastatic, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any current conventional drugs that
are able to treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBG seems to be especially promising
in treating prostate cancer and breast
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are two of the most common
cancers that become metastatic and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hard or sometimes impossible to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing phenomenal results from the
lab in terms of CBG as a treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: infections, including these
antibiotic-resistant infections,
[SPEAKER_00]: MRSA, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus, which is responsible for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of hospital-acquired infections and a
significant number of deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the exciting things about that
is so far from the lab, we don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: indication that these bacteria will
develop resistance to cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they do to contain conventional
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really may be revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is, again, that we've provided a
pattern of human use that indicates safety
[SPEAKER_00]: of these products, which is going to
facilitate moving them into the clinic for
[SPEAKER_00]: these specific indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this huge smile over here,
Ethan, because, you know, I was wrapping
[SPEAKER_01]: up the show and I was giving you kind of a
fishing question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you dropped on cannabis,
or excuse me, cancer and antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both huge applications that,
you know, because they weren't part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: purview of the study, I had not heard that
they were happening because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in private labs, like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any public research that's
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, as somebody who's
interested in both CBG and doing support
[SPEAKER_01]: for cancer patients, are there any studies
out there or you know of taking place that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to come out where we can read
more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the study by Appendino on
cannabigerol could be easily found on
[SPEAKER_00]: National Library of Medicine PubMed
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's well established and there'll be
a lot more lab studies coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for cancer, there are various
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if people would input on the PubMed
website, cannabigerol and cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll see the various hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's just the beginning of
what we expect will be quite a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: important studies yet to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we look forward to talking to you
about them here when they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan, thank you so much for reaching out
to me and wanting to talk about this new
[SPEAKER_01]: survey so that we can all get up to speed
as this new cannabinoid becomes more
[SPEAKER_01]: common to use and more common to find.
