[SPEAKER_00]: Today's another episode where I will be
learning right alongside of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started cultivating, I thought soil
was mostly inert and it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insert NPK and out came cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time though, I have been humbled by
how little I knew and I'm grateful for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the regenerative cultivation pathfinders
who constantly teach me what they have
[SPEAKER_00]: learned so that I can grow better flowers
in a way that most honors the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can be part of the solution and less
part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I have learned again and again
is that the soil is its own universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is infinitely complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: A truly regenerative cultivator doesn't
see the soil as something apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth and separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regenerative grower sees the soil in
their hands as the earth itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As regenerative cultivators, we are
constantly completing cycles, closing
[SPEAKER_00]: loops and acting in service to the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in service to the earth really
focuses our attention on how we can help
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth heal from the damage we have
done as humans and how to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership with the earth to grow the
best damn cannabis possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is Kawada Makviya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kawada Makviya is a highly respected and
sought after regenerative soil educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a friend of the microbes,
student of their ancient wisdom and
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher of their ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has years of experience working with
effective microorganisms and creating
[SPEAKER_00]: custom soil blends specific to the needs
of the plants he's working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does work in bioremediation of land and
waterways and teaching school kids these
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also teaches indigenous agricultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set, we're going to get a
good understanding of what biochar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the second set, we're going to
learn how to make biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the third set, we learn best
practices for using biochar in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: of any size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Kawada Mak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shango Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all probably seen biochar and seen
folks making biochar, but let's all start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a basic understanding of what biochar
actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take wood and burn it in hopes of
making biochar, what is it exactly that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're hoping to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we're trying to do is we're
hoping to create and leave behind just the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon structure of the biomass that we're
burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, by just keeping the
skeleton, the carbon of the biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to then contribute so many
benefits to the biology of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we consider life, we consider things
need water, but we also must consider how
[SPEAKER_01]: important carbon is as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to have when
we make good biochar is a good high
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of carbon remaining from the
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that idea that we're trying to get
ourselves down to the skeleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of like burning off the fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the aspects of the wood that
we're trying to remove so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the carbon core?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to burn off all of the
volatile gases from the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these volatile gases is what's going
to contribute to the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the heat pressure increases,
as this heat pressure is then going to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, or if you can imagine,
squeeze out the volatile gases from the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and hopes of just leaving us those
skeletal remains, the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, we are kind of refining
carbon in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking this beginning material of
wood and we're getting rid of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't necessarily want to use as a
fertilizer and purifying it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, a specialty carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the structure of that carbon,
it's going to be formed into a shape which
[SPEAKER_01]: is very similar to a beehive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that honeycomb structure is then going
to be home for many beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, nematodes, water
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think most of all we got to remember
is these bones or these carbon remains
[SPEAKER_01]: also have the electrical information about
that plant in which it grew in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this becomes a major contributing
factor in the regenerating growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: new successors of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring us back to the
electrical information in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with your first point
there on honeycomb, the honeycomb
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be too vague of a question,
but I'm going to give it a shot anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any explanation for why when we
burn wood we're left with the honeycomb I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, it's such a unique shape and it's so
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know why after we burn it,
it looks like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the pattern and the energy in
which drove the force of that plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: transport water and nutrients up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I call it skeletal remains,
but it can also be looked at as veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the pattern and structure of that
particular plant or tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this becomes very important because
each structure within each plant and tree
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be created differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in the diversity of those
structures, which allow many different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of microorganisms to then call that
carbon home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each unique structure will foster a
unique set of life form.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not expecting that bad ass answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, I really like the idea
that it is showing the vein structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant because it, you know,
this is to my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I learn about plant biology,
I learned more and more that my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that it's kind of uniform
within the plant and there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the flesh of the plant and then
the outside is just a real
[SPEAKER_00]: misunderstanding of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the interior botany of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I've ever thought about
that until now, because I've seen what
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar looks like up close and it is so
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you've got pits here and
elongated bits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're telling me that the burning
reveals the guts of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is telling me that the inside of the
living plant is far, far more complex than
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagining as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just scratching the surface on this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've looked at the plant in so
many different ways, but now as we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the electrical influences that
shape the plant and we get into this
[SPEAKER_01]: fourth phase water, we realize how
electric these things are and anything
[SPEAKER_01]: electric is going to need conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like we see mycelium growing
differently and threading differently,
[SPEAKER_01]: these patterns in nature, they repeat
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're finding these patterns and how
they relate to not just mycelium or plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, but your own human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many patterns within everything
that it's just become so, and this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the work so exciting because I'm
just a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have been, but the excitement of
watching patterns and shapes, you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: the relations and how they all come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's tie into the electrical info
because now you've hit on it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to know that there is our
electrical impulses in plants as there are
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to hear you talk so quickly about the
electrical info or the electrical history
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, I must admit, I don't
exactly even know what you mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break that out a little bit for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think of like a forest and how
that grows and how important the fire is
[SPEAKER_01]: to that forest to continue to grow and
stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not overran with invasives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see where that fire, as it comes
through and burns and leaves behind its
[SPEAKER_01]: skeletal structure, that that new plant
that grows, the new seed that grows is
[SPEAKER_01]: always stronger than the original plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we think of storing information
in carbon, this is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our phones and computers all use
carbon that we call silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the basis of loading information onto
the silica so we can access it when we
[SPEAKER_01]: need information, we can just whip our
phones out and get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never contributed or related that to
the forest itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we leave behind the carbon structure
of the parent, grandparent plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: have burned and their carbon is in the
soil, their successors can do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tap into that carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can know the relationships their
parents and grandparents had, meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, and how those symbiotic
relationships worked because it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon structure of the char.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what makes the forest so
intelligent and evolves the way that it
[SPEAKER_01]: does because it stores information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even now we realize there's
microorganisms, these electron microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that can join together, create a force
that can influence a lightning strike into
[SPEAKER_01]: an area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see where the forest fire is not
random, but more of a specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to create memory here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes somehow decide, influence a
lightning strike to carbonize because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is how the planet has done it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these patterns are nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mimic them as we develop computers and
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even as we talk biochar, we would have
we're used to doing this with farmers and
[SPEAKER_01]: conservationists and groups like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're getting the semiconductor
industry in the workshops because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for other carbon sources besides
silica to create computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like cannabis and hemp are
testing that 200% more semiconductor
[SPEAKER_01]: potential than other materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why we're now seeing the computer
guys at the workshops asking questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about the electrical side of things where
the sky's the limit with carbon and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that biochar could be,
you know, a natural hard drive for nature
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, you know, truly mind blowing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how literally should we take this idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that we've got a hugelkultur and
we're throwing biochar in it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're growing our cannabis plants on top
and the roots are going down and they come
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until our conversation,
I've been just imagining that moment is
[SPEAKER_00]: about two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the nutrition, fertilization
for my plant coming in contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar because it loves that,
that pyrogenic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, and then also it is touching the
bio, the roots of my cannabis plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the biochar, which is a home of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's providing them a variety of
shelter too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but now you've added something else,
which is this, this carbon from the now
[SPEAKER_00]: deceased and biocharred plant that there
are at a very simplistic level data points
[SPEAKER_00]: that are stored in this carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to get a little more poetic
about it, maybe it's like the story of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree that is being passed on to my
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, like, I guess I don't even
know what I'm asking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How literally should we take this fact
that there's information going from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree to my cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that plants communicate through
terpenes and when the plants have more
[SPEAKER_01]: information, when they have learned a
great deal of information from being under
[SPEAKER_01]: the stars, growing under the sun,
being in contact with carbon, that
[SPEAKER_01]: information then transfers into what we
know as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we test cannabis, that's growing
and this is what I love about the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we, us as the old farmers,
everyone, we always knew we had flavorful
[SPEAKER_01]: herb, but now we're to have the terpene
test and we can see those terpenes are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting higher and higher with the more
carbon or more information we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what makes it so exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we send this stuff into extract
where typically the capture of the oils
[SPEAKER_01]: under normal organic farming, they were
about 4% of the capturing oil out of
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass and extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the number up to 7%.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way more information or what the
bosses say, oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way more oil now in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then aside from that, we've doubled
and tripled the terpene scores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which for me, that's the most important
number I'm looking at because then that is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me that we are working with the
plant closely together and that plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have more information to then
share with the human who's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when we smoke the good herb
with the good flavor, you're going to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself who grew this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did it grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know the name, you want to
know the name of it and the parent of that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we had grown cannabis,
we've taken cannabis from a, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from a very, um, money driven
industry, but there's cultures where this
[SPEAKER_01]: is exactly how the cannabis plant was
raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more the cultivator, grows and becomes
a better person as they work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the plant knows the intention and
that information or what we call terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: is starting to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why special growers,
not just with cannabis, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing farm food or grapes, wine,
there's certain things where you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: the same inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the heart of the farmer is not in
the position of continuing to want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and make and improve himself, then that
information becomes limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ultimate goal when we grow these
plants is really about how we can become
[SPEAKER_01]: better humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then at the same time, the information
in which those are going to, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to consume those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have got to hope that that's the same
thing that's going to happen when they
[SPEAKER_01]: take on the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, information is translates and
into terpenes and into more oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a close relation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have somehow missed the mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we get, I mean, when you're
doubling your oil production, they start
[SPEAKER_01]: counting the stacks of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not thinking about what we just
talked about, but me who always wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve myself, I realized, man,
that is, can only be done with a close
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship to the plant, to the soil,
and to the people who are going to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant, envisioning who they are and
carrying that with you as you work out
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the information the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also an indictment of large scale,
automated growing too, because the more
[SPEAKER_00]: you scale and the more you automate,
the less interaction the farmer has with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no joke that highly automated
commercial flower is going to have lower
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles than smaller scale,
deeply loved plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your argument is that if the farmer's
not involved and the terpenes percentages
[SPEAKER_00]: are lower, it is very true that the
cultivator is communicating less with the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual toker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the kind of things where as
we strive to grow the best, we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize we're also trying to grow our best
self.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so closely related to how those
things go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this specialty carbon
that we're trying to refine out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they call it pyrogenic carbon,
of course, but why is this carbon so
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and so, well, hell, it's also
expensive if you buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's so special about pyrogenic carbon
compared to other carbon sources that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could feed our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to look at is how the
carbon is going to react within the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many soil types people have
around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, they use a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like the carbon allows for
that forgiving factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's be real, when people are
learning to grow or they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase something, terpenes or something,
they always want to use more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm finding like with the biochar,
it has such a forgiveness factor on not
[SPEAKER_01]: only the water that we're using,
the ingredients that we're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when we want it to go too much,
it seems to be a buffer and keep our pH in
[SPEAKER_01]: a range that's going to be favorable for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that being said, when our plants
are growing, we don't realize our soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: like a battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're draining from the battery,
it's going to have less and less energy to
[SPEAKER_01]: supply the plant, especially as the plant
develops and grows bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the char allows for the energy to be
kept up in the soil, but also calculating
[SPEAKER_01]: as the plant gets bigger, all of the
sunlight hitting the leaves are making
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars pump out of the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you calculating all those sugar
productions or are you just calculating
[SPEAKER_01]: your drops when it comes to soil health?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I have the biochar and I'm getting
the sugar production, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: I want when it comes to growing microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to just allow the
microorganism development to thrive much
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with permanent housing,
come on, who wouldn't thrive?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has hard permanent housing,
it has water, it has food, electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's everything you need to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the kinds of things that we
have to consider when we're developing
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your description of it, it sounds like
pyrogenic carbon is kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: flexible, knowing athletic carbon,
like good for any soil in the country can
[SPEAKER_00]: change and mold itself to what you need it
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's kind of like super
carbon or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a carbon goal that is just going to
simply outperform our other usual sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost is like super high right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what fascinates me is the USDA just
came off of a program where they're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: away char free every farmer in the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about this the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got very little cannabis people to sign
up, but tons of hazelnut farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USDA is understanding how we're
developing food with no carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like making houses without a building
code.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by them supplying the carbon free to
the farmers, they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to collect data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to send out
portable biochar units so that the farms
[SPEAKER_01]: can collect their own biomass and convert
on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is the agencies now are seeing
the value of char and trying to get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hands of people now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's up to the people to do their
homework to figure out okay, were they
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking this good thing to sell us
biochar or is it something good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I see the USDA now getting
involved, I mean, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something other than cannabis,
you know about the food production issues
[SPEAKER_01]: we have for our areas, especially low
income areas, this is why they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get char to everybody so we can have
sustainable food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just not for driving your cannabis
up to a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really about developing soil for
long term investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have major players now giving it to
people free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad that that we didn't have this
conversation before the USDA biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: program was completed because this would
have been a great plug to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm next time it happens,
I'll contact you as soon as I get the info
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can continue to support community
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I'd love to support farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to support that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's let's circle back around to
the advantages of the biochar now that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a better idea of, you know,
what it physically is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people ask you what the advantages
to their cannabis plant is, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: tell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to improve the immune system of
that plant, which then is going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: fight off a lot of diseases and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it just like a healthy person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always trying to encourage them
that by having a healthy plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be able to avoid many
things down the road that cause failure in
[SPEAKER_01]: our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that the biochar itself is
necessarily changing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the biochar is, you know,
providing homes for the microbes so that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a buffet of nutrition in the soil
and that it is good at holding water and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the plant is less likely to dry out and
the rhizosphere is less likely to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes cyst up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of essentially a soil regulator
and it's through that regulation that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to have better color and
better structure and better pest
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but also keep it in mind,
like each cannabis plant is going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: specific microbes that they're partnering
with, you know, we call them the
[SPEAKER_01]: endophytes now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't make a home for these
microbes to go in and out of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going through the loop, then that's
really what is going to drive that the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil and the healthy plant is
fostering the microbes in which that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: really wants to partner with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we can drop in inputs from
all kinds of beautiful creations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but essentially what I'm thinking is the
plant does want to partner with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the beautiful natural farming drops we're
doing, but it also has like a special
[SPEAKER_01]: group of partners that already has inside
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It carried from seed and allowing for
those little guys to continue to live,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether in the plant or out of the plant
in my char, I know that I have the A team
[SPEAKER_01]: for each plant because each plant has
their own different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the A team supported and that gives
me a way better chance of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we go to break, I would like to
hit on the water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already mentioned it a couple of
times, but a lot of people I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the first reason why they go to
Biochar because, you know, many of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially container farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little less so folks who are directly in
the ground, but definitely for container
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this, this whiplash thing where the
container goes from too dry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are sifting up and the soil is
getting hydrophobic to suddenly we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make up for it and we are making
the soil too wet then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so now it's too wet and it's
water logged and we're choking everything
[SPEAKER_00]: out from oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we let that dry out and then,
oh my gosh, then in a couple of weeks we
[SPEAKER_00]: were too dry again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the swinging back and forth,
we keep on hampering our microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: people say, well, that hasn't happened
since I've started using Biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us a little bit about the water
retentive capabilities and water
[SPEAKER_00]: equalizing abilities of Biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so in a lot of applications where
we're using the Biochar, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere between five to 15%, we're able
to cut that water down in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like you mentioned, the way the
water enters into the soil or pot and then
[SPEAKER_01]: respires back out, it makes all the
difference on how that plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the char, since all those little
pieces are holding water, it's distributed
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the system, seems to be much
safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much slower and it's just much better
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen some operations that are
doing about two gallons a day on full
[SPEAKER_01]: grown plants do fine and even better after
char was applied at one gallon per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is mixed into the rows or if
they, another section they did,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just dug out maybe about 10 gallons
of soil, mixed the char into there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put it back into the hole and planted
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't tell the difference
physically from the plants where the char
[SPEAKER_01]: was tilled in or the plants where the char
was just put into the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: They physically looked the same,
the same amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference was when they went to
lab, the rows with the char in the row
[SPEAKER_01]: scored higher, but plants still physically
looked really good from the lesser amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it makes your water go further and
it holds your water longer and it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like over time it gives the soil its own
slow drip of water instead of a flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you think of like below all
that where all the water is leaching down
[SPEAKER_01]: into when you have the micronized char,
headed further down into the soil system,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to aggregate the soil
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biofilms are different and all of
these contribute to water holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capacities when you have these things
going for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That micronized biochar is probably at the
core of why biochar regenerates abused and
[SPEAKER_00]: old soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can also put those in drip
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't clog up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so micronized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and it just keeps sinking deeper
and deeper through the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely more costly to use that
very fine activated, even activated carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: style, but the results are so quick and
they can integrate into many systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're doing hydroponic or,
or to, or soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are always like the one quit
shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they allow me to do anything to their
system, I'll pump into some very fine
[SPEAKER_01]: micronized char and the electrical charge
back to their soil always translates into
[SPEAKER_01]: plants praying that then that's where you
get more and more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people see their plants lift,
that's when they're become more receptive
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't take long when you add them
with the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just something about the healthy
glow of a, of a praying cannabis plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: make you believe in the strategy you're
using, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I think, I think it makes every
cultivator glow with pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's really how we know,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you come to work the next day
after a drop and they're doing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it plant yoga.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, cause the cells are just so hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just, it looks like they're
stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a yoga and it's nothing better than
to come to work in the morning and see
[SPEAKER_01]: them doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our first of two
short breaks and be right back when we
[SPEAKER_00]: come back in set two, we're going to talk
about choosing wood for making biochar and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make biochar and, and some best
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Kwadamukh Via.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without these advertisers, Shaping Fire
would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, organic cultivators have been
looking for a peat moss replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss has long been the go-to soil
amendment for water retention and
[SPEAKER_00]: container growing, but organic growers are
recognizing now that peat moss is an
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable resource and the mining of
peat bogs destroys wetland habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But peat moss works so well that many have
continued to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is finally a revolutionary
replacement for peat moss that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: better benefits while being a sustainable
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss sounds and acts like peat moss,
but instead of being mined from fragile
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems is actually made from upcycled
organic paper and cardboard headed for
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is excellent at retaining water
in your substrate and creating air pockets
[SPEAKER_00]: and tiny living environments for microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss instantly increases aeration,
nutrient absorption and water conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully and locally sourced,
pit moss is the result of decades long
[SPEAKER_00]: research into the use of recycled paper
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is lightweight and easy to use
and pit moss is inert so it won't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a range of preparations
including a nutrient enhanced blend and an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil conditioner with no added
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit moss is also available as an animal
bedding for horses, chickens and small
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.

[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many seed banks nowadays that
you really have options in who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, if you pick the wrong seed
bank, you could be in for a really sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one of the reasons I
recommend HEMBRA genetics collection to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and listeners who are looking for
a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's HEMBRA, spelled H-E-M-B-R-A.

[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis regulations become more
demanding and consumers become more
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, it is increasingly important to
avoid the use of chemical pesticides when
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects have been used for
decades by the greenhouse vegetable and
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plant industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, many cannabis cultivators are
moving from sprays and chemicals to
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shagalos, and my guest
today is Kwadamukh Via.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the break, we were talking about
what exactly biochar was and the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages to the plant, to the
rhizosphere in the soil, and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much the earth itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly the now microbes having
homes are definitely stoked too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this set, we're going to talk more
about actually how to make biochar because
[SPEAKER_00]: as we talked about in the first set,
if you're going to buy biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really not that hard to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like many things in our cultivation
scene, you know, it's time or money,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save a lot of money if you make
your own ferments instead of buying your
[SPEAKER_00]: own fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same way, if you've got enough
time, if you make your own biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have a super powerful ally to your
cultivation without actually having to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: your hard-earned money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start by talking about what kind
of wood we should use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, during the first set, you said that
these different types of woods,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have got different botanical setups
inside of the plant, inside of the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the shrub, whatever we're going
to make the biochar out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those provide different types of homes
for different microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would believe that, you know,
over the years, you have tried to make
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar out of lots of different types of
wood, and you've got to have some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites and for good reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about what you think through
when you're choosing the wood you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use for a biochar burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned before, one of my
favorite personal plants, it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, because in our industry,
nobody does anything with the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being that they're 200% more
conductive than other chars, that just
[SPEAKER_01]: allows for more electricity in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to close the loop too in our
industry by bringing that into,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're doing it at a veggie farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at the island where I live,
I'll grab the cannabis stocks from the
[SPEAKER_01]: producers on the island, and then bring
them to the veggie farm over at Topaz
[SPEAKER_01]: Farm, where we'll use it to grow
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my second favorite would be
blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackberry, if you think of the inside
pulpy material inside of that blackberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it chars, all of that pulp turns into
this beautiful crystallization that is
[SPEAKER_01]: easily micronized at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who doesn't have a lot of blackberry
out here in the Pacific Northwest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's been super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love doing like the hardwoods too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the hardwoods are going to just get
so hot and burn at a temperature where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just going to be able to add in
other materials to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the hardwoods are burning so hot,
I can maybe add in other kinds of wood I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not too crazy about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the high heat, it's going
to give me a different matrix of honeycomb
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what really excites me is the
matrix of the honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it's I love to see what people
bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up at our farm for the community
just to drop off their biomass just so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can convert as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was finding like the apple prunings
just made an amazing char as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a whole discovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned off of grapevines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the first conversion piles that
we did out in Napa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they would rotate the vineyards,
they usually would take them to the dumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we started turning them into biochar
and just incredible, incredible char
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from the grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit, I'm really surprised that
you are talking about, let alone
[SPEAKER_00]: preferring what I think of as soft plants
like the cannabis and hemp stalks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry versus hardwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really thought that the answer to the
question was you were just going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me a variety of trees that you liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really surprised that and we'll talk
more in detail about how to manage the
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar burn in a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really surprised that those soft
fleshed plants can be used at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're so soft, I would assume
that they would just like burn right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but let's think for a minute,
Shango.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're doing some cannabis breeding and
I'm working with this plant, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for a specific trait, the plant knows
what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it couldn't get there on that
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the seeds that come out of it,
if I don't put those skeletons of that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant back into the soil, it just seems
like it would take longer to achieve the
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics in which I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by adding the bones in of the plant,
the last breeding cycles, I think shortens
[SPEAKER_01]: the duration of what you're looking for
because the information then can get
[SPEAKER_01]: passed to the new seed where it's parent
information can say, hey, you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer that's growing us?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking for these specific terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If by chance you could grow them,
let's increase that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the strange way of the
cannabis plant, but you can see where if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's any legs to it at all,
you can really quicken and improve and
[SPEAKER_01]: become more targeted in the cannabinoid
research you're doing by adding in the old
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I like to use not only my
old cannabis that I've worked with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis from other farms too,
because it essentially is cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be talking to the new
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something I think is special about
that relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, definitely something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, I don't necessarily
consider myself especially spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I meditate and all, but compared
to the kind of ideas that you're laying
[SPEAKER_00]: out, these are mostly new to me,
I say humbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that you are bringing forth that
if the plants are holders of data and
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and how to repair the soil,
and if when we burn them into biochar,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is refining the carbon down to its
basics, and that carbon is holding memory
[SPEAKER_00]: just like carbon silica holds memory in
our iPhones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is feeding the memories back
into the earth, it really creates a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different motivation and intention for all
of us as humans to take all of our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: waste, our organic waste and turn it all
in the biochar and put it back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth because like, duh, why wouldn't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole package of idea right there
is all brand new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of like to picture it as,
you know, we have computer programmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are loading software on computer
to run specific apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about what you're doing when
you're making char, you're a nature
[SPEAKER_01]: programmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that char can be in the soil for
hundreds, thousands of years, it can have
[SPEAKER_01]: that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into it a little bit later,
but there's other ways you can load
[SPEAKER_01]: information onto the char too,
where the reality of you are really a
[SPEAKER_01]: co-creator and programming nature becomes
a reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create the char specifically from
the good, healthy blocks of the vineyard
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have, then create char with that
information that you can put into the less
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier blocks and continue to co-create
and regenerate soil that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about your favorite types
of wood and why we want to use different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of woods because they make different
types of housing structures and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: carry different kinds of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the worst to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any types of woods that you have
come across where you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, most all of them are great,
but this one is really not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any wood that we should avoid?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but you do want to avoid using wet
wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy a moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're about $40.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use wood that's between a 15
and 22% moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any biomass within that range,
it's going to combust beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem you'll have is when
you're using wood that's wet, that'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If temperature may not go up and making
biochar in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it rains so much, this is very
important because you don't want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: char and create a bunch of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If char is made correctly, you can use
that smoke to drive the combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture meter will keep you from ... All
wood is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to make sure it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of us cultivators who cut corners,
I happen to be one often, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't have moisture meters,
clearly a freshly cut tree is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the highest percentage of moisture,
whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a fireplace though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very used to the idea of taking down
a tree and bucking it and then putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in piles and then it'll be good the next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us, I don't know,
just a rule of thumb or some guesses for
[SPEAKER_00]: us about how long after we take down a
tree before it would be good for making
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same strategy as making
effective firewood or is it faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had our trees stacked from our
cuttings from the spring, they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: dry enough to burn in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times too, if we make the piles
but throw a tarp on the top, they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: release enough water so we can burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I cut piles in the fall but threw a
tarp on them, by springtime, they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken in all the rainwater and
released their water, it'd be good to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a chance where if I wanted
to do a burn and I had some material that
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of wet, but if I had three
quarters percent of that pile was really
[SPEAKER_01]: dry, you could integrate and mix the two
and get a full combustion from the
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain little tricks you can do
sometimes mixing really dry with wetter
[SPEAKER_01]: material or how you stack it or even
switch some of the kiln technologies where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use stuff a little bit wetter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, if it snaps, the rounds
that snap, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be some kind of a saying
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it snaps, it caps or if it snaps,
it's something to make a bumper sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that there's probably a good
conversation to be had right here about
[SPEAKER_00]: moving wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how they say don't move firewood
from one part of your state to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're moving all sorts of insects
or non-indigenous bugs that you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: helping spread around your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing that's probably the same when
you're making biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine people collecting wood at
place A and then moving it to place B to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into biochar where it's more
convenient for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably shouldn't do that,
should we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's times where that can be very
dangerous, ecological-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's times where some
biomass can be moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at how it's collected,
where it's stacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to put like a blanket rule on this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to figure out the materials that
we can and cannot use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's methods where we can employ that
to convert the biomass right on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many ways we can get the
conversion done, but maybe not just with
[SPEAKER_01]: one particular tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us who are natural farmers are very
much into IMO, indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microorganisms that are in your
locale, in your neighborhood, they're your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do what we can to beef them up and
use them in your local gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that same kind of idea might
go for the trees and other plants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use to make biochar, where if we're
saying, like you did in the first set,
[SPEAKER_00]: that our trees are holding memories,
if you will, of how to beat a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pest that it beat several years ago,
and it's still cellular knowledge for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, that it might make sense to focus
on making biochar with the kinds of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and even source them locally because
locally sourced plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a biochar that has got memory of
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the direction it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the conservation agencies now
employing the prescription burns that they
[SPEAKER_01]: call them, forestry groups that are doing
in-place conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly why, because you can't
import those goodies, they're created
[SPEAKER_01]: on-site and must be left on-site.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start going through a process of
making biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've seen biochar, I mean,
there may be many ways, but I've only seen
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people who dig a hole in the
ground that's pretty deep and has got
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty steep sides, and they throw
everything inside of that and they burn
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I see people who are using,
what do you call those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal things that are round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Kilns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilns Drums, that's what I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilns is a pretty sexy name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just meant oil drum looking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which do you prefer and does it matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to making char, most people
on farms are just doing burn piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're burning their waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we try to encourage them to do
instead of just burning their waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they employed a different burn
technique to their traditional burn piles,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be left with char.
[SPEAKER_01]: The method in which we're teaching them is
referred to as the conservation method.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conservation method is simply when you
light that pile of biomass, and these
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass, you have to check your local
regulations for maximum pile size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're going to do instead of
lighting, throwing a bunch of gas and
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting that pile on fire, what you want
to do is towards the top, you want to put
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller material and create a type of a
bird's nest, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird's nest where when you light that
fire, if you light it from the top at that
[SPEAKER_01]: bird's nest, when that little bird's nest
starts to burn and combust, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: excite the biomass just below it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it heats up and excites that biomass,
the gases are going to come out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wood and fuel that little light on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as that little light on top is
burning, you'll notice smoke start going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the top of that top lit fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke is actually combustible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't realize that when we make our
fires, but by lighting at the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the smoke to come back into the
flame, it's going to drive that top fire
[SPEAKER_01]: even hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more smoke that's coming out,
it's actually the fuel for that fire at
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's so cool about it is because
you no longer have those particulates
[SPEAKER_01]: going up into the air, but coming into the
flame for combustion, you could reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: particulates from these burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen them at the farms smoking out
all the neighborhood, but if that smoke is
[SPEAKER_01]: going into the flame front, driving the
combustion, that top lit fire is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get bigger and bigger and heat that pile
up so that the volatile gases get released
[SPEAKER_01]: from the fire and combusting all the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the practice of the art
comes in of conservation burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that fire burns that pile down,
you're going to notice the white little
[SPEAKER_01]: ash on the top of the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part where you want to
extinguish the fire so that you don't turn
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon into ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ash is basically oxidized carbon,
but you do want to get the gases out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning when to pull the trigger on that
fire, take some practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of really cool videos on
YouTube where people are using
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation burn with different sized
piles and materials, but you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: notice when they cool that fire down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part where the natural
farmers, you guys are going to love
[SPEAKER_01]: because when that fire carbon is in flux
and in heat, it basically has a memory
[SPEAKER_01]: that's neutralized and is pretty much
waiting to receive new information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hotter I drive the carbon,
the more I erase the old memory from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you say, well, you said V has a lot of
good memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you want to erase it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this case, there are times where I
want to erase some memory from carbon to
[SPEAKER_01]: load it up with new memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new memory is essentially all of the
great ferments that I've been creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: These ferments can be from your healthiest
plants or like I mentioned, your
[SPEAKER_01]: healthiest parts of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can record that information of
healthy soil in a liquid T form added to
[SPEAKER_01]: your water at the cooling process,
you're going to then add more memory to
[SPEAKER_01]: that carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where it gets even more exciting
because you are essentially programming
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they discovered the terra preta pits,
which means black earth, the biochar pits
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1960, Cornell University went down to
the Amazon to look at these carbon pits
[SPEAKER_01]: that were 10 to 15 feet of biochar,
but alongside them were Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Japanese scientists did tests on the
biochar that is still in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They not only looked at its physical
properties, but they're very interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: its electromagnetic properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, its potential to cast out
what we know as far infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Far infrared has the ability to have
microorganisms self divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that as mitosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a type of a thermal type of a heat,
but at the same time, it's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like hearing your favorite songs
while you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just gets the microbes cooking and
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the Japanese scientists left the
Amazon in the 1960s, they came back and
[SPEAKER_01]: they started playing with what we know
today as bioceramics.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are simply ceramics, silica quartz,
like the quartz crystal that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting around your house or quartz
crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grind those down and fire them at
2000 degrees to erase the memory,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then cool it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll cool it with the EM, effective
microbes, and they create this amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: bioceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japan has been playing with many forms of
bioceramic, whether they're mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: influenced or in Dr. Higa's case with EM
microbial influence, but their physical
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to cast electromagnetic frequency
in the far infrared at about 12 to 15
[SPEAKER_01]: inches away from the bag, lets you know we
know nothing about, there's so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we create our carbon and our biochar,
and we keep in mind of the principles that
[SPEAKER_01]: adding in these high-power microbial teas
are then going to create a physical and an
[SPEAKER_01]: electromagnetic property to the char,
I hope a grad student will pick up on
[SPEAKER_01]: testing different electromagnetic
potentials of char created under different
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO recipes and different consortias that
could potentially increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneration capacity of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so much in what you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go all the way back to the
conservation pile, but I want to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that anybody who was just turned on
by this idea of bioceramics, I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity of hearing Kwata talk about
bioceramics in the past, and it sounded
[SPEAKER_00]: unreasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked it up and the stuff really
exists and it is very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the trials that they have done
just putting bioceramics near other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that improved taste of wine and
things like this is truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to go down that path
today, but it is an amazing truth that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to Google bioceramics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, let's go all the way
back to the conservation piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found it interesting that we're
going to take our burn pile and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually really going to just make a small
fire at the top of the burn pile instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of just like torching the hell out of the
entire burn pile at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what we want to do is create this
physical nature of the pile where the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top is going to be pulling oxygen
up through the burn pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to be creating heat and
more and more heat in the burn pile,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really burning from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the burn pile itself becomes a
fuel source for this smaller fire that's
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said, well, when you're done,
that's also where you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguish your fire before it turns to
ash with water so that you're left with
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochar instead of just powdered ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said, take a look on YouTube
for videos so that you can get a visual
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of what we want the biochar
pile to look like when we put it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: like at what point do we put it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is probably really good advice to
turn people to YouTube to learn what that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had to describe it to us
without the video, what would you tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: to look for to know when to stop that burn
pile and we know we've got biochar and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get ash?
[SPEAKER_01]: The pile should be collapsed all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have at least 90% of the
charcoal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should start seeing a little bit of
white ash coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I use mixed woods, so there's
going to be some pieces that still are
[SPEAKER_01]: burning, but they're not going to have
enough time to convert or I'll lose a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of the small pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at what to separate,
what to cool, I'll even pull off some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger pieces sometimes with a rake
and then move them to the next pile
[SPEAKER_01]: because we'll have several piles going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, once I see that
pile has collapsed, most of it has turned
[SPEAKER_01]: white.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire should be very little,
if any, coming up at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point where I want to cool it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part where I hit it with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one more thing about the burn pile
before I move on to holes and trash cans,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is this conservation style burn
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really surprised that we're making
biochar with it because, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very limited experience in biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was reading about it, it was saying
that one of the key aspects of making
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar is that you're making it in a
limited oxygen environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why people make it in holes
and in oil drums or other types of drums
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you pack that space full of
wood and then you burn it, there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting biological reaction happening
in play because the area is small and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire cannot get all of the oxygen it wants
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it burns slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody commented online that the fire
can't get oxygen drunk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: While I don't know what that means
scientifically, it sounds really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can you tell me about the
importance of limiting oxygen when making
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why doesn't that really apply to the
conservation pile style?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll make a better char for sure the
more oxygen you can limit into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is farmers aren't going to
use drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get big farms to dig all these
holes and the amount of man hours to
[SPEAKER_01]: process the char and the pits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not feasible for a lot of
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first conservation burn method I
described to you is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: crudest way to make char.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way a lot of big farms who
are already burned in any way polluting
[SPEAKER_01]: the sky can convert piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to make higher quality
char, you're then are going to move to the
[SPEAKER_01]: drum technologies where you can get more
oxygen absent from the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to mention, you'll capture a lot
more char doing it in oxygen deprived
[SPEAKER_01]: environments than doing conservation burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the conservation burn is just an open
invite for many farmers who are already
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the practice to say, hey,
well, let me try this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, once they see the results
from that char, naturally, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make better char in your next run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the pit and the drums and
the kiln technologies start to come into
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the conservation burn is my gateway
carbon entry point to get farmers to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone through the gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we've got a bigger farm,
we're starting to make our piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all like, biochar, hell yeah,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're a smaller farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a craft hobbyist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a home grower where we love our
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want it to be high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, hell, I've got such a small
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take me a whole summer to put
together that much biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't have a big ass farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about level two of using a
drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you describe how to do a drum
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, with the drum, we have one
drum in which your feedstock that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the char with go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put all your material into one drum
with holes in that container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that drum typically goes into
another drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the outside in between the drums,
you're going to fill with biomass and
[SPEAKER_01]: different wood materials that then get
combusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the fire burns, it draws out the
volatile gases from the interior drum,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving you behind with pure carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, a lot of people use this
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get very smoky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you create very good char this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just takes a super long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you got to find two different
sizes of drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even that sounds like a pain in
the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's imagine that you have found these
two metal drums, one bigger than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said they've got holes drilled in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we drilling the holes?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to put them onto the side
and then down on the bottom so you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice draft coming up from the bottom of
the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a handful of drilled holes in the
sides, but then a whole bunch at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom because the idea is that it's
sucking in the oxygen at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also got to make sure you have
enough holes to release the volatile gases
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's to me, I think this is probably my
least favorite way to make char because of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the complications involved of making
sure my holes are the right size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they put too many in,
but that's the only drum you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just seems like it's a tougher
learning curve with that particular style.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pit char would be my second favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pit char, you're going to dig
yourself a hole into the ground and you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of want to cone out the shapes on
your pit that you make so you can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little edge around the outside of that pit
so air can come in and out of the pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the trick is when you light that pit,
you want to stack your wood above the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're about a foot and a half above
that ground level and same thing light at
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you light your pit char at the top,
your combustion rate is going to be super
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best part about the char pit is
once you get the fire up and going and
[SPEAKER_01]: burning, I can keep adding biomass to that
pit and as I'm adding the biomass to the
[SPEAKER_01]: burn pile, it's suffocating the coals
underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create a lot of char pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful, slow kind of a burn,
but you can just keep stacking into the
[SPEAKER_01]: hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: As to our conservation burn, you're
limited to the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pit char, you can keep adding biomass
and create quite a bit of biomass in a
[SPEAKER_01]: short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quality is just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you've got so much wood
material, burning and the hole is deep and
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you'd be limiting the oxygen,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the wood that's got this
slow and steady burn because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to get like all out of control
because the oxygen is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is our advantage to limiting the
oxygen is so that we get a slow and low
[SPEAKER_00]: lung char instead of here's a bunch of
oxygen and just have it go ape shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just burn to ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly how they feel too when
you're burning those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conservation burn is like mad and just
roaring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, in a vineyard when they got 20
foot piles where they usually take all
[SPEAKER_01]: day, three and four days even sometimes a
burn, that aggressive high temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: burn is nice because it's only three
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pit char, super nice, super slow,
good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even once you get the fire
burning nice, I can even throw in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit wetter wood because it's just going to
combust all within the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can convert more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably not favorable because of
that nice, calm, high heat from the pit
[SPEAKER_00]: char.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scaling up, like making more biochar
once you're already kind of sold and
[SPEAKER_00]: successful is easier than probably doing
it the very first time when you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are, for this example,
let's say that we're just talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: home cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that they're just like doing 20
plants or something and they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce biochar for the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big and how deep of a hole is
reasonable?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen lots of different holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see some people who are using
fricking backhoes for them and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: sickly see Nick Rysden who just spent an
afternoon digging a fricking hole that he
[SPEAKER_00]: can stand up in and making biochar in that
and not using a big old backhoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us a little idea of what this hole
is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like you to talk about that ring
around the top that you said that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in oxygen because I didn't follow
that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, I got people making the pits as
small as like a barbecue pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Weber size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people even making it in practicing in
the Weber, they can make small piles and
[SPEAKER_01]: then get the skill down and then,
you know, get it figured out on a small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, but it doesn't need to be big at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be just the size of a Weber and
that's great for a small cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm saying about the sides,
instead of having the sides of when you
[SPEAKER_01]: dig your hole being straight down into the
floor, if you can kind of angle that to
[SPEAKER_01]: the floor, so you're kind of at a 45 and
it over opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at something called a Tiki
Khan kiln, you'll see the shape of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiki Khan kiln or what's referred to as
the Oregon kiln and how it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the slant size that we need for
that type of burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we are making these slanted
sides, we're not filling up these slanted
[SPEAKER_00]: sides with material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually just still stacking up our
biochar kind of as a center column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these sides that are at 45 degrees are
not filled with wood and that just allows
[SPEAKER_00]: some oxygen to get down into our hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this 45 degrees go all the way to
our bottom or is it just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the top third?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it goes from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells me that like in my head,
I was imagining building a pit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, up to my neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a big asshole because you'd
have to go 45 degrees all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six feet of depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really big hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just even think of campfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually cool because your family
would love if you made a new campfire spot
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be bigger than campfire
size, but just the way you describe how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to stack your wood,
that's going to be the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't fill the thing up, but you make
that center column style.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a three by three hole is probably
all I need for my whole year, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm going to be adding more material as
it's burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll need plenty of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hole and we've started the fire at
the top and it's decreasing the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in the deeper parts of the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we're still getting good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a little bit of airflow from the
45 degree walls and it's clocking along
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're, we're throwing in some
additional biochar occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we, are we just leaving the top open
or are we covering it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: To extinguish?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trick is you want to, and it's even
referred to as a flame on the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure you keep a flame on
the cap of that pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that flame is what's going to
do all your conversion and that flame is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to keep oxygen out of your
carbon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping it, if you look at flame cap
kilns or flame cap pits, you'll see how
[SPEAKER_01]: they maintain it with the flame on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be your key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may need to add in different size
materials at different times of the
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion to maintain that ring all the
way around the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ring of fire on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be your converting
feedstock into biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why doesn't the flame, that cap flame,
why doesn't it work its way all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down so that I've got this like total
pyre?
[SPEAKER_01]: As it's releasing gases from the wood and
meeting the oxygen, that's our combustion
[SPEAKER_01]: point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't ever, the oxygen doesn't
make its way down into the carbon for
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real bad-ass skill to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to go back to the,
while we didn't really dig the drum
[SPEAKER_00]: version, I do want to ask one question
that's burning, good pun, in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, you said that we've got the
two different sizes of drum and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: burning material in the center,
but we've also got wood material between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two layers of drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are both the interior and are both sets of
wood going to be used as biochar or is
[SPEAKER_00]: only one of those sets of wood going to
become biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one, the one in the interior drum on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the stuff on the outside for?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the heat that's going to then
excite the volatile gases from the
[SPEAKER_01]: interior drum and get it to release
without actually being exposed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, since it really does
make sense that the vast majority of us
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably either going to dig a hole or
do a conservation burn, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into do the drum within drum version
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, if we have excited,
you know, listeners to like, go find out
[SPEAKER_00]: more, you and I have done our job,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as, as far as getting you to
teach it, I think that people generally
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what the drum version would be
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they want to explore that,
there's, you know, there's, there's lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of YouTube videos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about the end
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been going for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this very successful burn and,
and we have decided it's time to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: out because the material is starting,
it has, has collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the smaller stuff is starting
to get a little ashy and we want to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we just like put water on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we put it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're extinguishing with water
and keeping a rake handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to water down the pile and
kind of rake the coals around because
[SPEAKER_01]: they, there's just layers and layers of
charcoal under there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the bottom layer will stay hot,
even though it appears like it's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep it a rake as you're cooling that
char down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to allow that fire to go out
and maintain the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't put that thing out,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'll come the next day and
everything will turn to ash, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: you thought for sure the fire had went
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you'd be so sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of water and all that water gets
soaked back into the char too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like you're wasting any water
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water is definitely, you know,
you can't use too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The char is very hydrophobic at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to actually give it a nice
soaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water then is going to start to
attract the life forms that you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: charge up that char or get it inhabited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cooling part is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we just leave it in the hole
overnight and we walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can pull it out if it's cool
putting in storage containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically people just leave it until
the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next day, we look in our hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all this biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going like, hell yeah, Kwadamak
totally hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad I know this skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now what do we do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more in the next set about when
do we want big pieces and when do we want
[SPEAKER_00]: little pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm more asking you is storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I actually do with that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I go stack it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I put it in some kind of a bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep this stuff until we're
ready to use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can keep that thing in a pile
outside near anywhere near soil and soils
[SPEAKER_01]: or microbes are going to start being
attracted to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like to leave it out and open
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like we have to protect
it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you want things to come to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, so it's usually going to
house good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it actually is kind of becoming it's
attracting IMO at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap up this set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we come back, we'll start talking
about how to use this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take our second of two
short breaks and be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and my
guest today is Kwadamakvia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fully functioning greenhouse grows
extraordinary cannabis flowers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional bag appeal, great terpene
profiles and exceptional yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we have discussed many times on
Shaping Fire, a greenhouse is only as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as the environment you create for the
plants inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm has been on the forefront of
developing and installing highly efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse solutions since 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether new construction, major upgrades
or a retrofit, Biotherm's cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: climate solutions are tailored to each
grower's specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have root zone heating mats that
attach to a home hot water heater for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing areas 500 square feet or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere of the growing environment
directly affects the health and
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm offers heating, cooling,
dehumidification and CO2 enrichment to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the area where your plants
breathe and optimize plant growth by
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing the elements within the
cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm's dissolved oxygen irrigation
solutions will improve the vitality of
[SPEAKER_00]: your water and the efficiency of your
hydro delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you implement Biotherm's systemic
innovation, you'll experienced increased
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, improved plant vigor and increased
resistance to disease and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotherm offers free phone and email
support for everything they sell and will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you troubleshoot and diagnose issues
to get your equipment back online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The explosion of greenhouse cultivation
has crowded the field with novice
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants selling unproven gadgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you choose Biotherm to regulate your
greenhouse environment, you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on their over 40 years of
experience designing, installing and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting mission critical greenhouse
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants deserve nothing less than
Biotherm.

[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_00]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic flowering cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnome Automatics became a trusted and
loved brand in cannabis over the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years as Mandalorian Genetics and recently
changed their name to Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that has changed is the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Founder Dan Jimmy continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he releases for you to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score Gnome Automatics seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_00]: the website too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_00]: merch section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want reliable seeds, hand built
from effort, expert selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've discovered the benefits of
using cannabis, it's a very small step to
[SPEAKER_00]: start making your own Edibles Gummies with
these lotions, tinctures and concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: oils at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magical Butter has been helping cannabis
consumers become self-sufficient for over

importance of home growing so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to rely on others to feel healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Magical Butter machine can
empower your personal health by putting
[SPEAKER_00]: you in control of how you use cannabis in

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is Kwadimak Via.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here in the third set,
we have this beautiful biochar that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have already made during set two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are we gonna do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kwadimak already told us that we
don't have to keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to lay it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna start attracting microbes from
your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is exactly what we wanna do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we wanna use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted, you know, in the audience,
there's lots of different sizes of
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who are doing huge ass
hugelkultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got folks who are using
huge ass containers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100, 300 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got like a bunches of
people who are using containers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like sub 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got people who are,
you know, maybe wanna throw some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: in their house plants too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like this stuff sounds like such
magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna wanna put it in my like simple
ornamentals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I imagine when you're done with
a burn that you are seeing these different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes and you are starting to think about
what's gonna be used for what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of walk us through your
thought process when you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: this pile of various sizes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so before I was really anxious to
crush it all and make it all the same
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But later on, I started to realize how
good it was to have different sizes in my
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of leave, I do crush a little
bit, but I leave it mainly in its raw
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It falls apart pretty good as we handle
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that we're doing a hugel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start at the biggest size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you satisfied just for putting your
big ass pieces, your branches or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to have a variety of sizes
in every growing environment just based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the size that you're into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, small, medium or enlarge
pieces, but scaled to whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hugelmaas are one of those
recipients where they can actually take
[SPEAKER_01]: any size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually, the pieces I mentioned
that don't quite burn, but you can tell
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been charged and need more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually some of the best in the
hugelmaas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the hugelmaas, I find them the most
forgiving for all the different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when we get into the pots and
containers where I try to stay towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller pieces of char.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those big thick pieces that didn't
fully get charged up, they still got hard
[SPEAKER_00]: centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't feel bad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to bring its own set of
advantages to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we certainly shouldn't ignore it or
not include it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be helping in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be half hugel and half
biochar, but still contributing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the pieces we're typically
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not quite char and they're still
kind of woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mounds just take them and do
wonderful things with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are putting the biochar into,
assuming that we have dug into the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, because like, I know that
some people just make hugelmaas and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't dig in, but I'm picturing some
amount of digging into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ratio of the biochar do we want to
have in that hole?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go anywhere between five and
15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how much you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this a situation where up to 15%
more is better?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how should we decide whether or not we
want to use 5% or 15%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I have enough to do 15%,
should I always do 15% and stop at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are there ever any times where like,
no, because I'm using this other thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should only use five?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just mostly char is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't have it in abundance like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's say that like you've made your
own, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're biochar rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would want to use 15%, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 15% allows for like, sometimes if
you go too much char, there's this weird
[SPEAKER_01]: little adjustment period depending on the
kind of char that you have, soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found like 15% on the max just
allows for good soil development and not
[SPEAKER_01]: robbing from the host and allows me and
like, I'm always planting as soon as I use
[SPEAKER_01]: the char.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, some people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially like hugelmaas,
you know, I think it will use the right
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always planted my hugelmaas as soon as
we create them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, they say,
no, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the kinds of things where I
found 15% allows me to develop the ecology
[SPEAKER_01]: I need for that first season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just keeps me in a good position for
food production for that year or medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard that often myself,
people say, oh, I just built this
[SPEAKER_00]: hugelkultur, so we're not going to use it
this year, we're going to use it next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I've had like a lot of friends
who like build their hugelkultur and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like, well, you know,
sure, it'll be better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, let's plant it this year and
like get it going and get it primed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they grow these like insane
plants that are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all like, Oh, see,
you know, it's gonna be even better last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, but I'm glad I'm glad I used it this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you are definitely of on team use
your hugelkultur or use your hugelkultur
[SPEAKER_00]: with biochar, like as soon as you make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's because of the microbes
that I enlist to help me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was relying on the natural break down
microbes, they could lock out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things from my from my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since I'm an EM bokachi guy,
I use a lot of KNF stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of the drops I'm doing,
they're going right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus we got, you know, foliage
treatments at, you know, an arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things allow for my plant to
uptake and for biology to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: without going thermophilic or these other
pathways with all of the wood in the in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could potentially take it right on that
makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you are an effective farmer using
effective microorganisms, you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using a lot of the playbook of
our natural farming that helps get your
[SPEAKER_00]: hugelkultur up to speed super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% and same concept to like with char,
you're going to read on char where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, don't use it raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that same concept, if I'm feeding
my char raw, the same way I'm doing my
[SPEAKER_01]: mounds, and those first three,
four, five waterings are a nice tee that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know I've been bio or bio available for my
plant, I don't have to wait for the
[SPEAKER_01]: charging period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all being created naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since the EMs are just essentially
feeding the IMOs for the area,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really drawing them into the char.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do a lot of things where they tell
you, you can't do it with raw char,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because of the partnership with
specific microbes and those goodies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to get away with a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think I understand what raw
char is versus not raw char.
[SPEAKER_01]: So raw char is what they're going to
describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just burnt the biomass,
you got the honeycomb structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: you cooled it, there's really nobody
living in there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they say raw char, and I view a
picture the honeycomb structure as
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment buildings, you got to move in
things to those apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the microorganisms have moved in,
they consider that charged char.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you find as being best
practices for charging your char?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that earlier we talked about
just leaving your biochar out and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally gather IMO, and that's badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that spraying an IMO
solution on it that you have prior made,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds like a probable a pretty
reasonable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: So molasses is going to attract in the
goodies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding a little bit of molasses to your
water, when your water, and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: straining out compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a bag of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it with a sock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the tea bag extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting those goodies from the
compost, because it's already
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailable, you're going to know your
plants have the goodies that they need,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all of that's going to move into
the honeycomb structure of the char.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just want to spray it on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to dip the biochar into the
compost water or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be an application if you were
just made biochar and you want to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and mix with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we would call raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you wanted to top dress with the
char, you have your gardens already up and
[SPEAKER_01]: going, but you still want to add char.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add char to the surface,
but then water in with a compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that will begin to get the char
part of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that if you're going to top
dress with a biochar, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to also top that with soil or compost
because isn't biochar, it's most effective
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is kept moist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So having it on the top where it's wet,
dry, wet, dry every day as it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: watered, it's going to be harder for
microbes to establish, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but if you cap it with some
compost, well then now it's under the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and it's going to stay moist all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evaporation is going to come up through
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are on top, it still does get
some moisture, but scratching that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the surface gets it down into the
playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping that in mind, but if you got
slugs and things like that, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: eating your plants, leaving the bigger
chunks on the top, and around the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't like to crawl on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scratchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very scratchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's times where we'll top dress,
but big chunk around the base of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to keep crawling things off of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, biochar is like a do everything
member of your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have an idea of how much to use at
up to 15%, five to 15% in our hoogles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those numbers, you know, about the
same for containers or do we, do we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt for some reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every soil type is going to be different,
but typically I'll run between a 3% and a
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% for container gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also watering during my growing
cycle with, like, you can take that char
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have and make extracts too with
that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get just the dust particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of times where it seems
like you have less at the initial start
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're continually adding in with
your drops, your plants are going to love
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but you're building up the carbon,
the electricity, energy of that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep it in mind, add it in all,
not just a one-time drop, go micronized on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, go top dress on it, but always think
about your soil is draining.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's growing bigger, the energy is
going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to recharge that
and carbon is going to be that recharger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about really small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about my small ornamentals,
like my flowering plants that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smoke on my deck, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that's, stuff that's there to,
you know, look pretty for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dollies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it, is it the same,
same kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to, three to 5%?
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% typically are good at the house plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need, there's not a lot
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have like a crazy house plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll get them to flower some stuff,
like you haven't seen them throw flower
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll flower right up when you,
when you charm up and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, I didn't even know you made a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that, now that sounds like an
advantage for us in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of flowering plants that don't
like to live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so let's talk about getting them,
getting the biochar small and then this
[SPEAKER_00]: micronizing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you, you were very clear with us
that it's good to have biochar pieces in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of sizes so that it can be host to
a variety of types of microbes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just play more like a more
variety of roles in, in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say that we do want to get it
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe we want small pieces to top
dress so that we're discouraging slugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe we want to get it small because
we want to put a little bit in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a favorite house plant of ours
or, or, you know, maybe we want to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: small because we want to put it in the
batch bag with our compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make biochar smaller?
[SPEAKER_01]: No fancy technology, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we get a bucket sometimes and just
mosh it up in the bucket into,
[SPEAKER_01]: like with a hammer, you know, with a
shovel that the tips of your shovels can
[SPEAKER_01]: break that thing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll put it in between pie
boards, four by a pie boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you drive your machines around
the farm, you're going to crush it in
[SPEAKER_01]: between there back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've seen some of my friends,
their wives don't like it, but they'll put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the driveway and just drive over it
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly just crushes through your day to
day activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so there's really no fancy way
to, there's no trick to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend did a cement mixer where he put
in trailer hitch balls and let that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: run for a while and that broke it up kind
of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I've got access to lots of
burlap coffee bags, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can see me taking it and putting
it in that, and then honestly just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting it with a hammer, just because
like at small scale, that might be what
[SPEAKER_00]: works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, micronizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're describing this micronizing
and that's really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are we as cultivators making it at
micronized size or are we just pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in and then nature is breaking
it down to micronized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we bang it around, it's like glass,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time you move it, it breaks down
smaller and smaller, which I advise you to
[SPEAKER_01]: wear a mask when handling the char because
you're going to breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nature too is going to break it down
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the parts where as you're
watering, you're scratching the surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're moving things around, the char is
going to work its way down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has such a short life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to break pieces of that down if
I'm watering in my compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely love to add the char with
almost all of my drops, simply because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're out there doing cultivation,
you always are at that point where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give the plants all that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think every farmer can relate to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call it the hiring me or firing me
drops, where the plants are telling you,
[SPEAKER_01]: give me this, give me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're thinking in my head like,
oh my gosh, you're really pushing you
[SPEAKER_01]: girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you make the drop and it
works out and you know you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance from the char, these are the
parts where they're going to hire you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen people do the same drops
without the char and trash plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this allows the insurance for the
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to cover up your screw ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end result is the plants just they use
all that electricity and it just turns
[SPEAKER_01]: into plant yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant yoga.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you kind of like bring us
home here, Kodamug, here at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard you speak before and you have
spoken a lot about the interaction the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity, the interaction between the
biochar and the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are a very systemic thinker,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're constantly thinking about the
relationships between all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: players who are in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as natural growers,
the more and more we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: soil as a community that we are
supporting, and less as the soil being
[SPEAKER_00]: like this NPK-eating robot, I think that
we become more allies with the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of domination of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are adding something that sounds
like it is a very potent cause of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would expect that if we take,
you know, the simple communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we haven't been using biochar and we
start using it, I can imagine that there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a new environment in our soil for
all of the microbes and for our plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then eventually us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of like speak to this idea of what
it means to add this electrically gifted
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar to our soils and what might be
experienced by the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very fascinated with conservation
work and ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I find out is places around the
world where there's the most macro life,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most diversity, plant life,
where there's most diversity living and
[SPEAKER_01]: they look at the soil, it's always has a
high carbon content and it's loaded with
[SPEAKER_01]: char.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this tells me that when it happens
micro at the micro level and you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: it at the macro, something must be going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a like nature's playground of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many relationships
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to ask myself, what role did carbon
play in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I think further back as to
even how our whole planet started,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see where that carbon relationship
is hand in hand with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're only here for a short time on
this planet, you know, and it seems if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something we can do to co-create
life and foster life, and leave our
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent mark through carbon,
that's the real investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money comes and goes, but to say that this
investment we're making today is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be here in a thousand years.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many things can you say that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take on and have the
realization like, dude, I'm making a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for a thousand years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stand different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel like you got a purpose and it
makes it even playing field because all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this I picked up, which is barely a GED
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked at school, straight gangster from
the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I learned to work with the plant
and the plant taught me about soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: look how I ended up on shows on your show
talking about things the homies would
[SPEAKER_01]: never believe I picked up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only does it create life on the
planet, but it seems like it creates life
[SPEAKER_01]: within yourself and something about being
on this rock, especially in these times,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel like, man, I can do some
good, especially when we've done so much
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grabbing it with both hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like that life force that's even
within me, it must transfer over into life
[SPEAKER_01]: around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the kinds of things where
people feel like we can do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't wait around for someone to come
in and do this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is what we're born to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us in some way is born to
co-create, whether we're creating soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: we're creating art.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to believe it influences each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a financial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a money thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't eat none of that, but the soil
and the next thousand years I can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: positively and even spreading the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: If just one person starts to make charms
listening to this, and starts to program
[SPEAKER_01]: nature and finally starts to realize,
wow, I could really do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch what happens to that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it transforms a little area
into so much life, what does it do to an
[SPEAKER_01]: area where things aren't going so well?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add the carbon and the microbes
to an area, watch it change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a spot, a neighborhood and start
adding this to a spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come and visit that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch what happens to that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Birds show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butterflies show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, people with a picnic basket might
even end up there who you never saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: picnic there before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because something happens when you change
the soil that somehow changes the macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're part of that macro thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that this was able to make you
feel like you or have already been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of your natural farmers,
man, it's like, you don't realize what
[SPEAKER_01]: role we're playing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope this continues to inspire,
not just to create, but to share with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other how we're doing these things,
to share with the younger generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the ones who need it the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I definitely feel inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel all juiced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we'll, we might as well
leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quaddabuck, I'm so honored to have you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is our first
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your friendship and I look
forward to interacting with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I guess for now,
thank you for being a guest here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to meeting you again in
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Shango Los for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure to talk to you and our first
conversation to be recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a big fan of you for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing you at Emerald Cup a
couple of years back and wanted to go talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were so busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm really glad that we had this
opportunity today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessings, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would like to continue learning
more from Quaddamuck Via, there is only
[SPEAKER_00]: one place to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one center of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is at his Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was asking Quaddamuck
why, or, you know, where he wanted me to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn people onto, you know, he's all like,
oh, just my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, you know, you got,
do you have a, you know, a website or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, man, I don't have anything
to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all like, I'm just, I'm just here to
teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that like felt so good because,
you know, nothing against the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: come on my show to teach about a topic,
but then also, you know, make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we often make a living, but I gotta
admit, it's, it's refreshing to have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who has dedicated their life just
to, just to education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, his fantastic Instagram to
follow is Bokashi4u.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's B-O-K-A-S-H-I and then the number
four, and then the letter U.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Bokashi4u.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can follow along on Quaddamuck's
education of folks and adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you'll, you'll have found
out about things like the USDA biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: program that we didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's the place you want to go to
follow up.
