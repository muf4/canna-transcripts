[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Sunil Adderwal.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really an honor to be here with you
today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to thank my fellow panelists also
for getting me part of this with you all.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to just do two shout outs to my
colleagues to my right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Amanda Reiman is known for many years and
my PhD work at the University of
[SPEAKER_12]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_12]: I rely on her doctoral work in order to
develop the surveys that I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use to survey Washington State medical
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to honor her.
[SPEAKER_12]: Reiman is a leader in seeing patients,
medical cannabis dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_12]: healthcare facilities.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then part of the right, Dr. Mehdi
Stella.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to honor him because he actually
interviewed me when I was applying for
[SPEAKER_12]: admission to the University of Washington
School of Medicine in 2002.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was almost 15 years, 16 years ago,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I still remember that day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the first time that I wrote down
that I wanted to talk to researchers in
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoids and that we actually had
researchers at the university who had done
[SPEAKER_12]: research in cannabinoid receptors and
molecules.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dr. Stella met with me and he said,
well, you actually have read something
[SPEAKER_12]: about this.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that was nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was getting credit for cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was supposed to get discredit.
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, thank you Mehdi.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so what I'm going to talk to you
guys about my time today is what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_12]: in Washington State now as a physician,
clinician, and as I also do teaching and I
[SPEAKER_12]: do a little bit of research.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to touch on some of those
things today.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Laura Kaminski, thank you for
inviting me and asking me to kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: describe a little bit about my practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I also want to put some regulator
recommendations based on what things I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: seeing in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_12]: So back in early about a year ago,
I started doing one day a week an
[SPEAKER_12]: integrative medicine practice that had
been established in Bellevue, Washington
[SPEAKER_12]: called Sage Med Integrative Medicine,
which was founded by some naturopathic
[SPEAKER_12]: physicians, Sage Wheeler.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have my friend there.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was also seeing patients in physical
medicine and he invited me to come join as
[SPEAKER_12]: the allopathic doctor, the MD with the
group of integrative practitioners.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was excited about starting to expand
my practice like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And over the course of last 2017,
I moved it from one day a month,
[SPEAKER_12]: two days a month and November 1st,
I went full time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to tell you, it's been quite an
experience and trip.
[SPEAKER_12]: The kinds of things you get to see when
you're no longer, an employee doc working
[SPEAKER_12]: in a big system, but you're actually
trying to kind of see whoever comes to
[SPEAKER_12]: your door and trying to help them in
whatever ways you can.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my areas of clinical training are in
physical medicine and rehabilitation and
[SPEAKER_12]: hospice and palliative medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: And both of those have included training
in pain management as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are kind of the worlds that I put
out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've made efforts over the last few
months to try to ensure that I can see as
[SPEAKER_12]: many types of patients that I can see that
I can by accepting multiple forms of
[SPEAKER_12]: payers, i.e.
[SPEAKER_12]: insurers, everything from pretty much all
major private insurers in Washington
[SPEAKER_12]: State, starting sometime in early
November, I also got added to Medicare.
[SPEAKER_12]: So all patients on Medicare, which
includes people over the age of 65 and
[SPEAKER_12]: young people who have chronic diseases
such as hemodialysis, who are also on
[SPEAKER_12]: Medicare, even though they might be
younger because of disability or spinal
[SPEAKER_12]: cord injury.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also was added to provider one,
which is the state Medicaid, the major
[SPEAKER_12]: state Medicaid program, which includes
Washington Apple health and another is
[SPEAKER_12]: Molina.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's also been kind of a new
experience to see the range of type of
[SPEAKER_12]: patients from poor to more well-off,
those living with serious life-threatening
[SPEAKER_12]: illnesses to those who are living with
chronic diseases to those who are
[SPEAKER_12]: recovering from chronic diseases.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's another feature of the practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I've noticed, what I'm trying to
do with the cannabinoid side of things,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of calling it, people call this
cannabis integrative medicine or
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabinoid integrative medicine because
cannabis needs to fit into some schema of
[SPEAKER_12]: clinical care.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly a great medicine on its
own, but it's part of traditional medicine
[SPEAKER_12]: systems in which plants have been the
centerpiece, like Ayurvedic medicine,
[SPEAKER_12]: traditional Chinese medicine, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in my practice, I sort of see it as
how to integrate it into regular medical
[SPEAKER_12]: care that people are already receiving.
[SPEAKER_12]: In our SageMed clinic, we also have
acupuncturists, physical therapists,
[SPEAKER_12]: massage therapists, as I was mentioning,
the naturopathic physicians, including one
[SPEAKER_12]: naturopathic physician is also advanced
registered nurse practitioner.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this gives me a chance to recommend to
patients other types of care or I'm able
[SPEAKER_12]: to see how other forms of medicine see
them or how to, what would cannabis do
[SPEAKER_12]: when patients are also receiving
acupuncture?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I don't know, if you guys have
studied the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll see that cannabis isn't the only
thing that, you know, activates it or that
[SPEAKER_12]: can be demodulated because the
endocannabinoid system may essential
[SPEAKER_12]: functions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Dr. Stillett can tell you
much more about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's research that's been done on the
use of electro acupuncture as a way to
[SPEAKER_12]: stimulate endocannabinoids in the skin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's been research done on
osteopathic manipulative treatments as a
[SPEAKER_12]: way to boost endocannabinoid tone in the
spinal fluid.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's been research on running and
exercise as a way to increase
[SPEAKER_12]: endocannabinoid tone and masturbation to
orgasm to increase endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what real sex researchers in
Germany do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure it works other ways besides
masturbation too, but the point being,
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I guess that was probably the way
the review board signed off on the
[SPEAKER_12]: research.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's ethical issues.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, this is what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is, it's open to, the study of
cannabis opened up so much deeper
[SPEAKER_12]: understanding of how, you know,
the human body and not just the human
[SPEAKER_12]: body, but, you know, many biological
systems, animals from the sea squirts on
[SPEAKER_12]: up work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it makes sense to me, you know,
trying to be a clinical practitioner to
[SPEAKER_12]: try to think about patients in the
framework of, well, what can we do with
[SPEAKER_12]: your endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's potentially your tone low or high or
how can we modulate it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because cannabis is a homeostatic
modulatory, oh, I mean, the
[SPEAKER_12]: endocannabinoid system is a homeostatic
modulatory system.
[SPEAKER_12]: And many naturopathic doctors including
Michelle Sexton, who is a postdoc in
[SPEAKER_12]: MEPYSELVA's lab, she's written about
cannabis as an adaptogen, things like
[SPEAKER_12]: ashwagandha, which is a herb, herbidic
medicine is classified as an adaptogen,
[SPEAKER_12]: tulsi.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how can we best utilize those in
concert?
[SPEAKER_12]: The hard thing to do, the hard thing about
this compared to my colleagues who are
[SPEAKER_12]: doing, you know, medical workups of
patients and using whole genome analysis
[SPEAKER_12]: to understand are these patients slow
methylaters?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they have hormonal deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't really do that with
endocannabinoids at this time because to
[SPEAKER_12]: draw a blood sample and figure out
somebody's endocannabinoid tone,
[SPEAKER_12]: you have to freeze that down.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure MEPYSELVA can tell you way more
about the complexities of measuring actual
[SPEAKER_12]: endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have to use clinical markers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been really amazing to use,
to learn from Ethan Russo, who's,
[SPEAKER_12]: you all know well in Bombay, I don't know,
one of the international leaders he's
[SPEAKER_12]: written about the clinical endocannabinoid
deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Migraine headaches, fibromyalgia,
irritable bowel syndrome is kind of a
[SPEAKER_12]: triad and he's included other conditions
like endometriosis and other conditions
[SPEAKER_12]: which give us a sense into how patients
might have these complex symptoms and the
[SPEAKER_12]: research studies have shown that
endocannabinoid deficiencies might be
[SPEAKER_12]: involved.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been able to integrate,
try to trial cannabis products for these
[SPEAKER_12]: kinds of patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: And things seem, there are some pages that
have gotten quite a bit of nice results.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm very happy that the medical
system has available cannabinoid ratio,
[SPEAKER_12]: compound CBD, THC ratio, oral extracts
that I can use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I must say I do have challenges with
trying to utilize higher CBD products
[SPEAKER_12]: because they're just not so available.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's certainly true of whole plant CBD
rich extracts, probably you can get away
[SPEAKER_12]: with a lower dose than what the research
studies have been done with pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for example, a recent study in the
American Journal of Psychiatry was in
[SPEAKER_12]: London on schizophrenia showed a thousand
milligrams of CBD a day was effective for
[SPEAKER_12]: treating severe schizophrenic patients
compared to standard.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were actually already on their
standard anti-psychotics and they added
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD and they had improvements.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another step, well I'll say from Brazil,
showed 300 milligrams of CBD was effective
[SPEAKER_12]: in social anxiety.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then a recent preliminary study from
Yasmin Hurd's team at Mount Sinai showed
[SPEAKER_12]: 400 to 800 milligrams was effective in a
subject undergoing heroin withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, but where can you find 400
milligrams of CBD at the neighborhood 502
[SPEAKER_12]: shop?
[SPEAKER_12]: And how much are you gonna pay for that?
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe, you know, I may use pure CBD so
maybe we can get away with 50% of it,
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but I have had patients
who've had success coming off of
[SPEAKER_12]: Clonazepam, which is also a tick he's been
on for several years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've been able to do a slow dose
taper using, I think he's using five to
[SPEAKER_12]: one CBD THC ratio vape pens and extracts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's been, he's already more than
30, 40% down.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had a patient who's been dealing with
senapalto withdrawal for many years,
[SPEAKER_12]: which is another challenge and a typical
drug to come off of.
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's had a good success with
modulating some of her hyper arousal
[SPEAKER_12]: symptoms with CBD rich products.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanna give you a feeling of some
of the things I also see pediatric
[SPEAKER_12]: patients and adults.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's some challenges for
uncovered pediatric health conditions and
[SPEAKER_12]: licensed drivers between the ages of 16
and 20.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you're a licensed driver
between the ages of 16 and 20 and you
[SPEAKER_12]: happen to have a medical condition that
will benefit from cannabis, you can be
[SPEAKER_12]: medically authorized, but you can,
if you're at risk of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: automatic conviction, if you have any
amount of THC in the whole blood study,
[SPEAKER_12]: if somebody rams into you and the police
officer wants to do blood testing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have written, I've been involved in
some legal matter, the written letters for
[SPEAKER_12]: patients who've had some issues when they
had alcohol-related driving issues that
[SPEAKER_12]: were in their fault or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have no, I've called the Department
of Health, cannabis regulators,
[SPEAKER_12]: and they just say, no, there's nothing we
can do for these drivers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they just can't drive cars legally,
and that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ditto on mental health conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do have anxiety and you don't have
PTSD or traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we know that CBD has anxiety-related
properties, and THC-CBD ratios can help
[SPEAKER_12]: with that, why aren't we allowed to
authorize patients to use that?
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that has to do with the stigma
of mental health conditions.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, I feel like we need to
do some more with clearing up the stigma
[SPEAKER_12]: of cannabis use in public places and in
healthcare facilities.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had spoken to the Department of,
to Christy Weeks, who previously used to
[SPEAKER_12]: run the program at the Department of
Health, and she had said they have no
[SPEAKER_12]: issues with cannabis use in healthcare
facilities.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think state hospitals,
nursing homes, from the state regulatory
[SPEAKER_12]: standpoint, but I don't think state
facilities who are regulated by the state
[SPEAKER_12]: hospital commission or the state nursing
home commission know that the state has no
[SPEAKER_12]: issue with qualified cannabis use in their
facilities, and that would help to make
[SPEAKER_12]: direct administrators in those facilities
more comfortable with cannabis use,
[SPEAKER_12]: which those patients and people,
citizens, should have access to under the
[SPEAKER_12]: state law.
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are just a few of the health,
the regulatory issues I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Research and teaching, I can't really talk
too much about, but I can train residents
[SPEAKER_12]: and medical students, so I'm happy to try
to pass this information on to future
[SPEAKER_12]: generations coming up who have much more
open understanding of these issues,
[SPEAKER_12]: because many of them are born after
medical care won't even exist as a thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: They'd never know the time without it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm doing work on cannabis as a
traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: On the research side, how to deal with the
stigma of contraband and how to preserve
[SPEAKER_12]: traditional medical uses, such as they've
done in India and other places.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so pleased to be here in a room full
of leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you all are leaders in one aspect
of this industry or another, and what I
[SPEAKER_03]: would like to go over is how we can all
create more leaders in the messaging that
[SPEAKER_03]: we are going to provide, and different
ways of getting legalized and create
[SPEAKER_03]: security for this industry legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the CEO of E-Mart, and we have been
doing cannabis extractions for about 22
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I came aboard in about 2009,
it was pretty clear to me that of all of
[SPEAKER_03]: the different kinds of methodologies that
the founder of the company had created,
[SPEAKER_03]: that he was very, very into botanicals as
medicine and food, and that was the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why I had moved back to Seattle from
Miami, was to get into nutrition as
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine and food.
[SPEAKER_03]: That path didn't exactly happen,
but I realized there were a few extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: methodologies, that were creating an
Achilles heel for the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily anything that came up with a
law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, all right, we are only going to
promote CO2 and ethanol for this industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: because without a pure, safe product,
there's no way that this is going to move
[SPEAKER_03]: forward as fast as it could without a
clear pathway for fire departments,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the police, for medical applications,
for all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't legalize on the medical
without that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we created, basically, the CO2 aspect
of this whole industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a million good competitors now,
but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both for the founder, myself,
and the entire company, our main purpose
[SPEAKER_03]: is completely focused on plants as
nutrition and medicine, and getting that
[SPEAKER_03]: message across in everything we can
possibly do to do it, because that is our
[SPEAKER_03]: security for this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to create successful
businesses that can then turn around and
[SPEAKER_03]: give that same messaging back is how we
create more leaders and how we continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came to be here because I am an
anti-person, triple anti-personality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a total workaholic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I recognize, when I was living in
Miami, that it would be really cool to
[SPEAKER_03]: create some kind of retreat, where people
like myself could go and get advice on
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrition, exercise, learn how to take
care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because face it, as somebody just recently
told me, if I don't get the oxygen mask
[SPEAKER_03]: first, I can't help anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I want to make it clear,
too, to all of you here, because think
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You all need the oxygen mask first,
because without you as leaders,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Wired magazine sometime in
maybe 2000s did an article that Seattle
[SPEAKER_03]: was being number one most likely place
that socially responsible businesses would
[SPEAKER_03]: come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an epicenter for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are perfectly situated being
interested in sustainability and where our
[SPEAKER_03]: food comes from, being foodies,
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do a lot of national traveling,
and I can tell you, too, that we live in a
[SPEAKER_03]: hot knowledge bubble here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the new extraction methodologies
that I have seen using normal,
[SPEAKER_03]: already established scientific extraction
technologies came from here first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's our responsibility to keep this
moving forward, which is why I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: share this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This orange is a whole food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And inside this orange, you've got the
pulp, and then you have this white stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's called pith.
[SPEAKER_03]: And inside of there are really important
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, the skin has almost more
vitamin C than the pulp does.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can juice this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the danger of just having the juice is
that you can get too much sugar,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can raise insulin levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as opposed to just eating this whole
fruit, obviously, the outer skin feels
[SPEAKER_03]: also extremely nutritious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's full of delightful turkeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is the same thing, except far,
far, far beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is almost practically a whole food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's high in protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the most perfect ratio of negative
6 to negative 3 oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has so many different nutrients that we
need that it actually is a food.
[SPEAKER_03]: But who's talking about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great, you know, the gal,
Pam Dyer, who's local, who does a
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Butterfly Sessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she does a beautiful job of marketing
this content, of actually raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got primarily the THCA,
the CDDA, which anybody can utilize for
[SPEAKER_03]: health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is how we should be marketing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we can get through to everyone
as far as it just being a food,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you can't categorize it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just place it in pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just place it in medical or just
recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to create a nutraceutical
definition in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other countries have a nutraceutical
definition, which is basically a food with
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can, with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can create this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we have to do is focus on it and
continue to create more leaders following
[SPEAKER_03]: these lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an extraction company, this philosophy
puts us in a very interesting position
[SPEAKER_03]: because obviously you can isolate
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole lot of people isolating
different things out of the plant now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all wonderful and great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all excited about what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, we're doing that to plants
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started taking components out of plants
in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that we took out of a
plant was morphine out of loggies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we really want to go down that path
with this plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this plant is our way out of that
methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant can completely change our
entire medical system by utilizing what we
[SPEAKER_03]: now know about the endocannabinoid system
and the entralogy effect and having
[SPEAKER_03]: people's endocannabinoid systems analyzed
and treating individual and
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system deficiencies
because we all have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all different.
And so that would create compound
pharmacies for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving myself a chill moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have compound pharmacies based on
this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many years ago, when we first started
legalizing on CBD, some of us knew that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tikim Olam in Israel has been studying
this for well over a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: That CBD alone is not that effective for
very long.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to add THC back into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD has a bell curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they discovered this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they added a little bit of THC back
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made the efficacy, increased the
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it stabilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant is telling us what we need to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, sure, at the time, I was like,
yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalize on CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're going to figure out that
once you've already legalized,
[SPEAKER_03]: whoops, we're going to have to add some
other cannabinoids in there, maybe some
[SPEAKER_03]: turpeins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're still going down that path.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still only a few of us who
really, in the whole scheme of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: who really understand this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to message it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have the best widget to,
you can have the best alarm alarm on the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't message it and you don't
market it, no one is going to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to make it a part of every
single marketing thing that you can think
[SPEAKER_03]: of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as far as farmers go,
think about, I know that there are a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of farmers in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been so unbelievably difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost makes you want to cry how hard
it has been for them these last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about if we had a raw cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much more you would be able to
sell to be able to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the normalization that would bring to
the industry and the plant by just saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I'm just going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to juice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't create that psychotropic
feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just about health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get that messaging across,
we'll all be more secure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't want to downplay isolates and
all that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, isolates are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to emphasize that when we do
do isolate, we do it responsibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have the orange, or we can take a
vitamin C pill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can take the vitamin C pill,
but we're not going to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: bioflavonoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to get any of the other
properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why this is on this planet was
to feed us, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the fact is, unbelievably of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are made for each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to bastardize that is sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to keep getting this
message across that recreating things for
[SPEAKER_03]: specific illnesses is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still have so far to go to
understand what all of them do,
[SPEAKER_03]: our endocannabinoid system, how the
artifact works, all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to keep open minds and keep that
sense of responsibility alive and well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that we can all continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can change so many other things
that this planet is speaking to us to
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is Amanda Reiman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first, I want to say that the ideas
behind an endocannabinoid deficiency
[SPEAKER_04]: syndrome are on my world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And getting relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I totally hear where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the idea that we could actually
assess the functioning of someone's
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system when they are very
young and then give them supplemental
[SPEAKER_04]: therapy so that they never develop
epilepsy or they never develop MS.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell all the students I know that if
you are all interested in science,
[SPEAKER_04]: go into the field of endocannabinoid
research because it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Simil and I were saying when
we were getting lunch today that we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: often get to sit on panels together
anymore because there was a time 15 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago when there were so few Canada
scientists that any time they wanted a
[SPEAKER_04]: science panel, we were all on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we have had the opportunity to
diversify to where we have the biologists
[SPEAKER_04]: and the genome scientists and the social
scientists and the addiction researchers
[SPEAKER_04]: who are all starting to specialize in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get really excited when I get emails
from PhD students and grad students who
[SPEAKER_04]: say, I'm doing my dissertation on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing projects on cannabis because I
don't want to do it forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want to be able to give the
reins to the younger generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel that as we move more towards
legitimacy, and regulation, there is a
[SPEAKER_04]: sense of the social movement behind
cannabis that doesn't always come along
[SPEAKER_04]: with that transfer of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're transferring knowledge about cell
cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're transferring knowledge about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really transferring the knowledge
about the culture and the importance of
[SPEAKER_04]: the social movement that was medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really what I want to touch on a
bit today when I talk about kind of my own
[SPEAKER_04]: research path in this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to say right now, my current
position is not in research fully.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work with a company in California called
Flocona, which is a branded cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution company that works with
small, sun-grown farmers in Mendocino and
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_04]: I myself live in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity make up
the Holy Grail, the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're interested in that part of my
life, I'd be more than happy to talk with
[SPEAKER_04]: you about it during the networking session
or dinner tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: But today I'm going to talk about the
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Sunil was talking about the
synergistic effects of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: things like acupuncture and masturbation,
I think that how I can best describe the
[SPEAKER_04]: work that I do is very similar to what
Sunil does, except at a 10,000 foot view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my interest has always been the
intersection between cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: different aspects of social justice,
health care, social movements,
[SPEAKER_04]: equity, equality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like cannabis touches all
of those aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in many ways throughout our history,
cannabis has been part of the catalyst for
[SPEAKER_04]: social change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it continues to be that today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that back in the 1960s when we
started the war on drugs, basically two
[SPEAKER_04]: jail people who were using cannabis to
promote social change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's continued through people getting
their children taken away and having to
[SPEAKER_04]: become medical refugees because they want
to make good health care decisions for
[SPEAKER_04]: their families.
[SPEAKER_04]: It continues with the small, sun-grown
farmers that refuse to go to the way of
[SPEAKER_04]: large industrialized agriculture and
instead want to change the way we do food
[SPEAKER_04]: production in the US rather than go that
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis has been involved in all of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's very important for
anybody who hopes to be successful in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry to really understand the history
of cannabis as a social movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I moved to the Bay Area to Oakland in
2002 from Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really had no idea about medical
cannabis except the small bits I'd seen on
[SPEAKER_04]: the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I arrived in the Bay Area,
I became a medical cannabis patient
[SPEAKER_04]: because I had been using cannabis to treat
my own arthritis for years in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, very, very much in the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I started to visit dispensaries back
then in the early 2000s in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_04]: Berkeley, and San Francisco, what I
noticed was something very unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis aside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was also a PhD student at Berkeley in
social welfare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea was that I was kind of
studying social movements in the social
[SPEAKER_04]: welfare program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I saw when I went to those early
dispensaries was unlike anything I had
[SPEAKER_04]: seen in any other area of health care,
which is a truly socialized community
[SPEAKER_04]: based health care system that did not just
tolerate marginalized populations,
[SPEAKER_04]: but actually actively sought to care for
marginalized populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was more out of HIV activism than
the LGBTQ movement in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a little bit of a quiz,
and this is not going to take away your
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to do anything later.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you have heard of Brownie Mary
Rathburn?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and how many of you have heard of
Dennis Perrone?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to give a little brief
history for those of you who may not know
[SPEAKER_04]: who these folks are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back in San Francisco in the 1980s,
the AIDS epidemic was in full swing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as many of you know, who are old
enough to remember, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: misinformation about how HIV was spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was thoughts that it could be
spread by hugging, or by using someone's
[SPEAKER_04]: toilet seat, or by wearing the same piece
of clothing as them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't just the people who are
patients that believe this, it was the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors and it was the nurses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the advice they gave to family members
when someone was diagnosed was,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, hug them for the last time,
but be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these folks suffered a great deal
of social isolation, and a death sentence
[SPEAKER_04]: on top of that, and horrific side effects
from the medications that were available
[SPEAKER_04]: at the time, or not having access to
medications at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were two figures that emerged at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was Brownie Mary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brownie Mary was a volunteer at SF General
Hospital in the AIDS ward.
[SPEAKER_04]: She would go and visit with the patients
there, and she would bring them pot
[SPEAKER_04]: brownies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she wouldn't tell anybody what was in
the brownies, but she would bring them in,
[SPEAKER_04]: she would give them to the patients,
and it would absolutely help the side
[SPEAKER_04]: effects of their medications and the
symptoms of having the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another gentleman in San
Francisco, Dennis Perrone, who had been an
[SPEAKER_04]: activist for some time, and his partner
had HIV.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of you may have seen the movie
Dallas Buyers Club, where you see folks
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of lined up outside the house to get
their HIV medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll picture that in the Haight-Ashbury
neighborhood of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_04]: but giving away cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was an opportunity not just
for folks to get the medicine they needed,
[SPEAKER_04]: but to actually engage in a community that
wasn't afraid of them, to engage in a
[SPEAKER_04]: community that would touch them,
that would give them the care that they
[SPEAKER_04]: were looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the early dispensary system of the Bay
Area absolutely reflected that community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that when you walked into the
dispensary, there was a tray of weed
[SPEAKER_04]: laying on the table with rolling papers
for anybody that needed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was free food available.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lawyer there in case you had a
legal case pending and you needed some
[SPEAKER_04]: free legal advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was peer counseling.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was doggy daycare for folks who had
to go to doctor's appointments all day,
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't have anyone to look after their
dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was free internet access,
when in the early 2000s there was still a
[SPEAKER_04]: huge digital divide going on where folks
didn't have access to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a place that you could hang out
all day long and consume cannabis and do
[SPEAKER_04]: art projects and play in the garden and
have a sense of community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as somebody who was studying social
welfare, I was like, this does not happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: This does not happen in any other sector
of care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if you're going to a
chiropractor's office or a gynecologist's
[SPEAKER_04]: office, you're not going to see this sense
of community care.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to do my doctoral
dissertation on how these medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities, I'll tell you about that in a
second, were operating as healthcare
[SPEAKER_04]: providers because I knew that as we got
more into regulation, we were going to see
[SPEAKER_04]: these social model dispensaries kind of
become Walgreens and CVSs and we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I felt that it was very important to
capture what was happening at this time
[SPEAKER_04]: because cannabis was really leading us
into an alternative healthcare way that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've seen taken off since then,
coupled with the intersection of people
[SPEAKER_04]: being more and more concerned about
pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said medical cannabis facilities,
and I just had this as a caveat,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is almost, I think, a great piece of
history.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2002, the dispensaries were afraid
to call themselves dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were afraid that it would implicate
them as dispensing something to the
[SPEAKER_04]: public, which in California, except for
Prop 215, which is basically one
[SPEAKER_04]: paragraph, they really didn't have
permission to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't want to be named as
dispensaries in my research for fear of
[SPEAKER_04]: legal retribution, so they asked to be
called facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because they felt that it would be
safer for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so I did this study back in 2006,
and I did a study of 130 medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: patients to find out more about how they
were utilizing dispensaries and what they
[SPEAKER_04]: were getting from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give you an idea of how little we
knew back then, this was 16 years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: 130 patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the largest sample of medical
cannabis patients in existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: 130, that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so out of this survey, which I have to
give credit to Dr. Frank Lucido and Dr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd Micaria, who really pioneered the
medical profession of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Micaria being a psychiatrist,
Dr. Lucido being a family practitioner,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the first doctors in California to
recommend cannabis, had a very long and
[SPEAKER_04]: extensive intake form that he asked all of
his patients to fill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I borrowed heavily from his intake form
for my dissertation research instrument,
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of the questions on that survey
was, are you using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_04]: substitute for something else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I just threw the question on there
because it was on Dr. Lucido's survey,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I didn't think too much about it until
I saw the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw that 53% of my samples said they
were using cannabis as a substitute for
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that 75% of my samples said they were
using cannabis as a substitute for
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 25% of my samples said that they were
using it as a substitute for illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, wow, you know, this is harm
reduction, which I was a very big fan of
[SPEAKER_04]: as a paradigm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the idea that you don't have to
demand abstinence from someone who's using
[SPEAKER_04]: substances in order to make their lives
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, a lot of times it makes their
lives worse if they're not ready to go
[SPEAKER_04]: that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we can talk about it later in
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I saw that, and I thought,
well, this is really interesting because
[SPEAKER_04]: if we can think about cannabis instead of
a gateway drug as being an exit drug,
[SPEAKER_04]: then maybe there's some potential for it
as an addiction treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, if you see something
interesting in your research, the first
[SPEAKER_04]: thing you want to do is replicate that
research to see if what you found was just
[SPEAKER_04]: a fluke or if there's really something
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I replicated that study again a few
years later with 350 patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I found the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my colleague, Khalid Lucas,
up in Canada, replicated that study with
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 patients in Canada, and we found the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really felt that we were on to
the fact that patients were absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: engaging in this substitution behavior and
that they were having good outcomes as a
[SPEAKER_04]: result.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that, we morphed the discussion about
the opioid epidemic and the role that
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis could play in helping this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we see population-based data on this,
the study that came out in 2015 in JAMA
[SPEAKER_04]: that showed a 25% reduction in
opiate-related mortality in places that
[SPEAKER_04]: have medical cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see significant reductions in Medicare
Part D reimbursements for opiates in
[SPEAKER_04]: states that have access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see all of this really great data on
the population level, and then we hear
[SPEAKER_04]: patients saying, oh, this absolutely
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, yes, like 99% of patients say
that it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a study on this last year,
and they all really like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we haven't been able to do largely
because of both the addiction paradigm
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have decided is OK in this country
and because the Schedule I status of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is really study this as a
clinical outcome study, where we're
[SPEAKER_04]: matching patients who are using opiates
and patients that are using cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the first of these studies is
actually now taking place at the Albert
[SPEAKER_04]: Einstein Medical School of New York,
which is extremely exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a lot of work to do if we're
really going to move forward with cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: as a viable treatment for substance use
disorder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the problem is, as you know,
the line drawn between illicit and illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs is completely arbitrary in this
country, but we've done a very good job of
[SPEAKER_04]: convincing people that all the drugs on
one side of the line are OK and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs on the other side of the line are
horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have a conversation about what
it means for patients to have
[SPEAKER_04]: self-determination about how they choose
to get better and the methods they choose
[SPEAKER_04]: to get better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have conversations about
paternalism that we place upon especially
[SPEAKER_04]: women and people of color in this country
about what we think they need to do to
[SPEAKER_04]: prove their words to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis, again, intersects with all
of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the last thing I want to say is
that as you move forward in your cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses, very few of you, maybe not
even any of you, are researchers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but keeping with you the idea of the
evolution of cannabis in the social space
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be extremely important in
ensuring that the next wave of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: commerce is really in line with that
social movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I first saw 15 years ago and doesn't
go the way of the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and doesn't go the way of industrialized
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get to decide that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the ways we do that is by
transferring the knowledge, not just the
[SPEAKER_04]: technical knowledge, but the cultural
knowledge and the research knowledge and
[SPEAKER_04]: the clinical knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just as important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much again for having me
and I look forward to talking to you about
[SPEAKER_04]: many things later on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Randy Simmons.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was asked to be on this panel and my
response was, are you sure?
[SPEAKER_10]: I really started that conversation by
saying, I'm not sure I have anything to
[SPEAKER_10]: offer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I got listed with the other panelists
for it and they said, I must be here for
[SPEAKER_10]: the calming relief because I cannot match
what they have done in this industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I can talk about is passion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And two years ago, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So two years ago I walked away from,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is probably the most fun job I've
ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Working with great people, some of you in
this room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of us not always on the same page in
this room.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was a passion.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think about the passion of people that
are involved in this industry and I ended
[SPEAKER_10]: up walking away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ended up walking away from the passion
of people like Patrick who donates his
[SPEAKER_10]: time and energy and his life to supporting
military survivors of PSTD.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I have a pen for 22, too many
that I wear.
[SPEAKER_10]: And others of you in this room that have
shared over the years that two years ago I
[SPEAKER_10]: walked away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's gone on in my life in two
years?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been dominated by cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my wife of 43 years, in October,
a couple years back, had no cancer in her
[SPEAKER_10]: body.
[SPEAKER_10]: By June, she was at stage three breast
cancer, which had entered the lymph node
[SPEAKER_10]: system.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so then how do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's consuming.
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the things that's done is it's
consuming is I've always tried to figure
[SPEAKER_10]: out what it is you're dealing with and
working with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the unfortunate aspect of that is,
fortunately and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_10]: we went to see all the Cancer Care
Alliance, which is probably one of the
[SPEAKER_10]: better cancer centers in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, there have been a lot of people
from other countries that were there
[SPEAKER_10]: because of the care and service that's
provided.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it upset me and frustrated me to watch
what had to happen for a couple of
[SPEAKER_10]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_10]: One, to watch over a 16-week period as my
wife's body was filled with poisons that
[SPEAKER_10]: was intended to kill the cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're aware of what chemo does,
and three different types of chemo
[SPEAKER_10]: medicines during that period of time,
that killed not only the cancer cells,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they killed healthy cells.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you're in that process of trying
to rebuild your body after that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: And following that was surgery,
a bilateral mastectomy that she went
[SPEAKER_10]: through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though she only had cancer on one
side, she is a bracket gene individual,
[SPEAKER_10]: which means that her chances were 80% that
she would eventually have cancer on the
[SPEAKER_10]: other side, and then removal of her
ovaries because the bracket is fed by
[SPEAKER_10]: estrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all those things worked together to
prevent that she would continue to go
[SPEAKER_10]: through this process of dealing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And after that, radiation, which was a
seven-week period of radiation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, up in North Seattle, in Northgate,
there is a proton therapy center which
[SPEAKER_10]: uses a new type of radiation, which
doesn't go all the way through the body.
[SPEAKER_10]: Photon radiation that most people get was
not something that my wife could use
[SPEAKER_10]: because she has a heart issue,
and that wouldn't burn the heart.
[SPEAKER_10]: So using proton radiation gave her the
opportunity to not have the radiation go
[SPEAKER_10]: all the way through her body.
[SPEAKER_10]: The downside of that is the insurance
companies won't cover that radiation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was $149,000 billed that the
insurance companies would not cover.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully and gratefully, many
organizations came together to share that
[SPEAKER_10]: cost.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of you in this room shared that
cost.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what did I do?
[SPEAKER_10]: I started looking.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, research that's done.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the research that these people
have done is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's so much more that needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thing that holds us back is no
different today than it was two weeks ago
[SPEAKER_10]: or two years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no different after Mr. Sessions made
his comments on the list prior.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to change where we're at as a
nation and have a view of this plant here
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's a plant with many beneficial
aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as it's a schedule on substance,
we're not going to be able to do the
[SPEAKER_10]: research or get the research funding.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to turn our attention to having
changes made at the national level,
[SPEAKER_10]: which means when you go home at night,
please all be write letters to your
[SPEAKER_10]: elected officials.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now, the door's been open
for about, you know, and thank goodness a
[SPEAKER_10]: Republican senator from Colorado stood up
and said, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we need to do is continue the same
things we've been doing for the last
[SPEAKER_10]: several years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to move a normalization of this
plant in this nation to something other
[SPEAKER_10]: than a drug that Richard Nixon hated
because he didn't like hippies.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so it would take all of us
moving in a direction to continue to move
[SPEAKER_10]: to the normalization of this plant so we
can take the medical benefits from it,
[SPEAKER_10]: the nutritional benefits from it because
there's so much that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's only at the point where we can
get funding and we can have people not on
[SPEAKER_10]: small research projects, large research
projects.
[SPEAKER_10]: You heard earlier today about the fact
people from universities go in and have
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody else do the detective work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the best universities in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are we not allowing them to do the
research on this?
[SPEAKER_10]: So as my wife was going through these
treatments, I started doing research,
[SPEAKER_10]: my summer project, so to speak,
and looked at the work that was done by
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Christina Sanchez in the University of
Detroit and the work that she's now moved
[SPEAKER_10]: into her credit lab there on cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at some of the American
media and the stories of work she's done
[SPEAKER_10]: that talks about how she's slowed down the
cancer growth using cannabis, that's not
[SPEAKER_10]: true.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's killed cancer cells using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the story that needs to get
out, not that she's slowed it down,
[SPEAKER_10]: but that she's killed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at the work that Dr. Liu
at the University of London has done in a
[SPEAKER_10]: combination of chemo with cannabis,
the result is that you can get by with
[SPEAKER_10]: killing this gene or this cell with a lot
less chemotherapy drugs, a lot less impact
[SPEAKER_10]: to the body, and no recovery time,
no loss of hair, no neuropathy,
[SPEAKER_10]: and all the other things that go along
with chemo for cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to look at this work in some of
the other places and we need to open up
[SPEAKER_10]: what's going on in this nation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was asked to speak here today because
the testimony I gave at a recent hearing,
[SPEAKER_10]: and somebody wrote, that testimony asked
me to come and tell that story.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why I was here.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it has to be about the passion.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your passion?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a passion for something,
then go after it and keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This has become my son's project.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's sitting right over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: To figure out how do we move forward?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because she's through with chemo,
she's through with surgery, she's through
[SPEAKER_10]: with radiation, she's not through with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: The impacts on her body from these drugs
and for these treatments are already
[SPEAKER_10]: lasting and will continue.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what have we been doing to counteract
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've been using cannabis oils on
her neuropathy and her feet to bring that
[SPEAKER_10]: feeling back and to increase that blood
flow again.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also encourage cannabis use from care
providers in case anybody wants to know
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, we need to look at what is
happening within the medical profession
[SPEAKER_10]: and the insurance profession.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you heard earlier here today about an
opportunity for all of you, part of the
[SPEAKER_10]: organization to have insurance.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a stop there because you
have to know what that insurance covers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need a change in both the medical
profession, in the medical world,
[SPEAKER_10]: and in the insurance world.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure that the products
that can be developed out of this plant
[SPEAKER_10]: and the research that can be done to make
sure that we have the right cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: profile, including what the truth is due,
based on different diseases.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's different types of cancer
cells, do they all work the same?
[SPEAKER_10]: We need all that research done.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know I'm sounding like an
advertisement here today, but good,
[SPEAKER_10]: that's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate this panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you have medical doctors that
will step out and look at how the use of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabinoids can benefit their patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the research that's done at
many levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think back about it, in the early
years, the medical cannabis use drove the
[SPEAKER_10]: idea of legalization and recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really hoping that the push for legal
recreational marijuana in the other states
[SPEAKER_10]: returns the favor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's just a discussion about what
can we do on a national level if we remove
[SPEAKER_10]: the substance as a skill to one and let
the medical community really do the work
[SPEAKER_10]: they need to do to figure out how to
change people's lives for the better and
[SPEAKER_10]: so we can eliminate diseases.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at GW Pharmaceuticals out of
Emon, what they've done with oral spray
[SPEAKER_10]: for epilepsy seizures, the drug they call
a drug that X-Fact are working on for
[SPEAKER_10]: elimination of type 2 diabetes,
we all need to be aware of those things
[SPEAKER_10]: that are going on and we need to push the
elected officials and this nation to move
[SPEAKER_10]: that same direction because then we all
get to benefit of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: For ourselves and for our loved ones,
thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for sharing those stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the stories that are really
stimulating and gives a lot of sense to
[SPEAKER_06]: the work that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to thank Clara and Oscar who
introduced me to this venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my second year and I think it's
such an incredible gathering, the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid ecosystem that brings every
part of this new chapter together from the
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture to research to the policy
making.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's very important that we have
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm Nafis Talak.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a basic researcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been studying the cannabinoid
signaling system for about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a biologist and a pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about how molecules travel in your
body and how they act on our different
[SPEAKER_06]: organs, how they affect our brains and how
they affect different types of tissues.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been studying that for about 25
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 20 years ago, I came here at the
University of Washington and started my
[SPEAKER_06]: lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: The initial idea was that 20 years ago,
a lot of people were telling me that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy to start studying cannabinoids to
schedule one license whether to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was already some evidence that
cannabis has some very promising medical
[SPEAKER_06]: properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought, well, the other advantage
that cannabis has is what we call it has a
[SPEAKER_06]: very safe therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_06]: The profile of side effects is very low.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really have, there's no overdose
that you can obtain from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a very safe therapeutic index.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you want when you want to
have new medicines.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to have new medicines that by the
way are also safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only take care of the disease but
don't induce all the very bad side
[SPEAKER_06]: effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought I might start studying that
and try to optimize those medical
[SPEAKER_06]: properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a young field that I came into the
cannabinoid research field because it was
[SPEAKER_06]: the last drug that people started to
understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: People already understood how
methamphetamine works, how opioid works.
[SPEAKER_06]: But 20 years ago, we only knew what the
molecule was.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have any ideas of the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a very exciting field for
curious scientists to go into because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a lot of things that you can
discover.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in shaping the research that we did in
my laboratory, the first thing we did is
[SPEAKER_06]: we listened to the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to develop a therapeutic
approach, let's start with something that
[SPEAKER_06]: has a lot of promises and the multiple
sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two more recent types of research that
we've been doing in my laboratory are
[SPEAKER_06]: again because of the strongest evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one is the epilepsy field.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absolutely remarkable what's
happening today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm particularly touched because the
therapeutic approaches that are being
[SPEAKER_06]: developed for seizures are for kids that
have these seizures and it's always very
[SPEAKER_06]: gratifying to develop new therapeutic
approaches that will help the young
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we study how cannabinoids regulate
seizures in different ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: We confirmed and extended this really
exciting result that showed that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabidiol has an anti-seizure property
and we're finding results that show that
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe cannabidiol might not be the only
molecule and maybe we can complement and
[SPEAKER_06]: start having this concept of entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is very promising and it's
just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of research that we
can do to continue optimizing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second area of research is
cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We followed up on the steps of those
standard scripts that showed that
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid compounds can actually
directly kill cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not terrific for all cancer types,
but some cancers actually respond
[SPEAKER_06]: remarkably well and it'd be really
interesting to understand why this cancer
[SPEAKER_06]: type responds very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that we did is if it's not
working well for other types of cancer,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe we can optimize it and make it
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the two big efforts that are
happening particularly in my lab and our
[SPEAKER_06]: goal is from a very basic research,
from a concept to move this forward and
[SPEAKER_06]: create a new type of transformative
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: The word transformative is very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means that medicine has a lack and that
we create something that will actually
[SPEAKER_06]: fill this need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the cannabinoid compounds
have that ability to actually hit at some
[SPEAKER_06]: diseases that we're not able to address.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, the Dravet Epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: These kits are not able to be treated by
any of our standard care and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_06]: have a remarkable effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing this effort and we're
trying to push this forward into clinical
[SPEAKER_06]: trials and we're working with NIH very
closely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working with some pharma.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually started a company around this
technology so really we could actually
[SPEAKER_06]: protect this and go all the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that actually was an interesting step
for my career five years ago when we
[SPEAKER_06]: started this company because I started
thinking about the business aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it mean to start a company?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the challenges?
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's so many young entrepreneurs in
this room and the challenges that we face
[SPEAKER_06]: in starting companies so I started getting
really interested in business questions
[SPEAKER_06]: which is so not an academic way of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a really nice component.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's also why I really enjoy
being part of this current community is
[SPEAKER_06]: because we are able to have both the
research and the business and development
[SPEAKER_06]: part talk to each other and try to work
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I502 started germinating several
years ago and I always was very interested
[SPEAKER_06]: in legal and policy making questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had the chance of helping for I502 on
one of their panels to provide some
[SPEAKER_06]: advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love the part where when in policy
making the legislatures actually reach out
[SPEAKER_06]: to scientists to provide some framework of
what are the results and how can we
[SPEAKER_06]: actually shape the legal structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a very, very strong way to
work together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've been in very close touch with
the University of Washington Law School,
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis law and policy project
because again I think it's very important
[SPEAKER_06]: that there was some interactions between
the lawmakers and the scientists.
[SPEAKER_06]: That gave us the opportunity to actually
work with the Washington State Liquor and
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Board and each time we're able to
provide some advice and maybe some help.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always kind of happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then about three or four years ago a
group of leaders at the University of
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington including myself really decided
to step up and try to organize the forces
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have at the University of
Washington because we're in the middle of
[SPEAKER_06]: an extraordinary big experiment that's
happening and it's our duty as academics
[SPEAKER_06]: to try to help and do some research and
help that all this process goes well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we formulated the idea of creating a
center for cannabis research that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: an entity that could help and perform some
research on the academic ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the School of Leadership we went
several times to Olympia and had some very
[SPEAKER_06]: productive discussions with some senators
and some representatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're all trying to work together
to try to implement this center so that we
[SPEAKER_06]: can actually perform the research that is
really necessary in these times of
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we are building this center which
is currently still very virtual but what
[SPEAKER_06]: we've done is we've kind of reached out
and tried to understand who are the
[SPEAKER_06]: academics that are interested in cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course there's the Stella Lab because
we've been doing that for 25 years and we
[SPEAKER_06]: have a scheduled one and you've been there
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we reached out and what we realized is
that there was over about 50 different
[SPEAKER_06]: very high quality teams of researchers at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of experts here in
Washington that are interested in cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: related questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the breadth of interest is
extraordinarily large.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the medical school, there's the
law school, there's the social work,
[SPEAKER_06]: so many forestry, so many actually
academics that understand that it's part
[SPEAKER_06]: of their mission to study this plant and
try to help out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're very excited to mobilize all
this intellect and try to help out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to think about the cannabis field
as a continuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very broad, continuous field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, currently society is
very polarized.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either it's the best thing ever or it's
close to the devil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's too polarized and I think
that's one of the message that I think the
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists are trying to portray is that
it's a continuum and then there's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be specific questions that we need to
address in every aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: The health aspect is there's a toxicity
profile that's associated to cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is clearly not good indication for
women that are pregnant whose very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very strong evidence that it could be
toxic to the embryo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's actually an easy fix.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just about educating the people that
they're not supposed to be using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Young people also are very good that we
have a legal system that limits the age of
[SPEAKER_06]: use.
[SPEAKER_06]: The harm reduction is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from toxicity then now we have harm
reduction that might actually substitute
[SPEAKER_06]: things like cannabis and you do stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's tremendous benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's at the health level,
at the industry level.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are new jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's new concerns about the job,
whether there's some toxicity associated
[SPEAKER_06]: with the pesticides that people are
working with.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many questions that needs to be
addressed as a continuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the plant itself actually is so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's what, maybe a hundred scientific
articles on the biology of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and as compared to millions on the
tomato.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need research.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a potential that is tremendous in
understanding this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you can talk about the DNA and the
genetics, actually it has a very special
[SPEAKER_06]: DNA and therefore even the genetics of the
plant are just fascinated by the more
[SPEAKER_06]: beauty of the genetics of this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's really a tremendous amount of
research to be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've reached out at the University of
Washington with other entities to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: synchronize our efforts so that we're not
the only ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're talking to WSU to see what
they're doing and try to synergize.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking to other states.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing in California?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're starting centers for cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we actually coordinate our efforts?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying and I think it is moving
forward and we need to be working
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in conclusion, I think what we're
realizing is this world is changing very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all very excited about this new
chapter that we're happening to write.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think by working together,
we need to be able to foster what the
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much benefit in this new
chapter and we need to be concerned about
[SPEAKER_06]: reducing all the potential toxicity or
certain types of pitfalls of this industry
[SPEAKER_06]: as it continues.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my time allocated and we'll be
happy to discuss some of those specific
[SPEAKER_06]: questions that you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Danielle, come forward please.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in this association, what we will do is
adapt very quickly to try something we
[SPEAKER_11]: think is going to give added value to
businesses that help sponsor.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what we're going to do really
quick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we're going to take questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Danielle, right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you enjoy this panel?
[SPEAKER_11]: This panel is sponsored by Buddies
Recreational.
[SPEAKER_11]: Buddies Recreational is a unique cannabis
experience celebrating its great nexus of
[SPEAKER_11]: music and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Buddies is dedicated to bringing their
customers the best products, the best
[SPEAKER_11]: prices as well as being active
participants in the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Miles.
[SPEAKER_11]: Time for a picture.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be here in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked earlier about that value added
and this is a business association.
[SPEAKER_11]: These businesses are sponsoring.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get a media available,
a good use picture for their market.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will do this at the next panel as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will mention to you, I love this
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the panels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do this because I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things I love about it,
other than the brilliance, is when I hear
[SPEAKER_11]: it in sentences.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've known companies and groups like this
all over the country for almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never have I heard acupuncture and
masturbation in the same sentence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I've got four questions over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Randy, I wanted to thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question to you is that I would like
for you to reiterate and explain a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit something from your testimony before
the LCP about homegrown, which is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: connected the difficulties that you've
been through and the need for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: research with the viability and
desirability of homegrown with this little
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like you to possibly elaborate on that
today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Quickly is because I think until you get
to that point where that is allowed,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not going to normalize this plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a five-year-old who does not
respond to high CVE.
[SPEAKER_02]: She responds to high THC, cannabis,
for her terminal genetic disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington State particularly,
to be completely honest, I'm glad the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: memo is not something they can stand on
anymore because preventing youth access is
[SPEAKER_02]: just reaper madness 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a mother of a child who has no options
left other than high THC whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis oil, I see a big concern in the
industry that businesses are saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we're keeping it away from kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to wonder what's happening to the
hundreds of pediatric cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_02]: under the age of 18 years old that have
products, the only products for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: take because they can't smoke,
are all labeled with a sticker that says
[SPEAKER_02]: not for children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as business owners, it is your
responsibility to step up and service
[SPEAKER_02]: these patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm forced to educate my doctors because
no one is doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see this panel knowing Sunil who has
been instrumental in aiding in pediatric
[SPEAKER_02]: education, especially around CBD not being
the only cannabinoid, and I wonder if any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the other panelists are taking steps to
address this big concern that it needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: become an issue that cannabis is for
children.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that Rafael Noculum did,
35 years ago, did a study on epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_03]: the problem that he presents, and also
what we're saying on this panel too,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that no one wanted to do the clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, it was illegal, and then
there's also a great expense due to
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of at a point where they're
starting, but it's not happening faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is criminal that this is
criminal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me just say one quick thing for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: The FDA allows the manufacturer of
pharmaceutical THC, which is THC and
[SPEAKER_12]: sesame seed oil and soft gels and
capsules, which has been on the market
[SPEAKER_12]: since 1985, it allows the manufacturers,
and now it's multiple manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_12]: of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So label it, an FDA approved label,
which has pediatric dose and guidelines
[SPEAKER_12]: for pure THC.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Israel has also done studies in
inpatient pediatric oncology wards with
[SPEAKER_12]: vaporized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the FDA point, I think, should drive
home any doubt that the medical system
[SPEAKER_12]: doesn't allow or think about THC for
pediatric patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess my question really quickly is
that you mentioned a lot of the trials
[SPEAKER_08]: where CBD is added to treatments for
children, things like that, and in the
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmacological data for that,
you'll see that CBD acts on the side of
[SPEAKER_08]: the formal enzymes, and so because of
that, these kids that are on childhood
[SPEAKER_08]: epilepsy medications, the CBD itself,
while protecting the brain, isn't
[SPEAKER_08]: necessarily stopping seizures.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's inducing the blocking of the liver
enzyme, which is raising the levels of the
[SPEAKER_08]: medication they're already on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it really CBD stopping seizures or
CBD simply raising the medication?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which are then more efficient in stopping
the drug with less side effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same thing said for those
associated with cancer, treatment for
[SPEAKER_08]: specific cancers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps all of this therapy is not so
much from the cannabinoids directly,
[SPEAKER_08]: but from the induction of these liver
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will do the research.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, so you do have to, if you're using
CBD with patients who are on
[SPEAKER_12]: pharmaceuticals, you need to be familiar
with drug-drug interactions between CBD
[SPEAKER_12]: and other drugs, and there's nice tables
that have been published.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a great Medscape article by a
pharmacist, the University of Alabama
[SPEAKER_12]: group that's done clinical trials in CBD.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or for instance, on there too.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a whole, you gotta really know the
list, and you gotta know, and then a
[SPEAKER_12]: doctor in Colorado, I'm blanking on her
name right now, but she's done a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: the early pediatric epilepsy research.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's also put together a table.
[SPEAKER_12]: So compiling a few of those tables,
and I'm happy to send those to anybody,
[SPEAKER_12]: anyone else with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important to know that there
are talks, you have to watch for those
[SPEAKER_12]: high levels, because those drugs don't
have as wide of a therapeutic window as
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you do get into higher levels,
that could impact your liver enzymes and
[SPEAKER_12]: other things, so you should monitor those
drug levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that's really,
one of the things that's really good about
[SPEAKER_11]: the summit is while he was asking his
question, I could see eyes lighting up all
[SPEAKER_11]: around him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the question gets asked, and you
hear, well, we could.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I heard that, the fourth summit
happens.
[SPEAKER_11]: The next summit is, here's what we found
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So go forward.
Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a question regarding the
research that you guys cited, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really promising stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an easy way for the general
public to access this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we start sharing on social media to
educate people so that they can get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the segments in the community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, one of the big, horrible
things about research is that it's largely
[SPEAKER_04]: kept from the general public through the
cost of journal subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was a professor at Berkeley,
I had access to everything that the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of California is subscribed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm not anymore, I don't have
access to anything, unless it's an open
[SPEAKER_04]: access journal, which means that the
author pays for their own copyright.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any time I publish something,
I publish it open access, because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: who my research is for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not for people sitting in offices in
academia.
[SPEAKER_04]: ResearchGate, I think, is a good tool out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Sunil is on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can follow us as researchers,
and we upload everything that we publish
[SPEAKER_04]: onto there so that people can download it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a really good resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Drug Policy Alliance, where I used to
work, which is just drugpolicy.org,
[SPEAKER_04]: has a really good repository library on
their website as well that has a ton of
[SPEAKER_04]: articles that you can access.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the ability of the general public
to access the academic literature is a
[SPEAKER_06]: huge issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll add real quick to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a gap.
[SPEAKER_06]: These scientific papers are really heavy
and hard to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to be spending your time
reading those.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we need is a solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a website at the
University of Washington, the ADAI
[SPEAKER_06]: website, where you have scientists that
actually read the literature and then
[SPEAKER_06]: summarize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so therefore, what we're trying to
implement is a website where your
[SPEAKER_06]: questions, you can go and say,
so what is the deal about kinetic diet and
[SPEAKER_06]: anxiety?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have an area where you can
actually click and say, these are the
[SPEAKER_06]: strongest results, and this is what is
known.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to be some kind of filtering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's our job as academics is
to gather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's so many papers,
and some are not the same quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need a first level of filtering,
and that's what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working in that direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, final question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This question is for Sumeet and Casey.
[SPEAKER_05]: So earlier, you were talking about how
getting high dosages of whole plant CBD to
[SPEAKER_05]: patients is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a whole plant guy, and I'm not a
big fan of isolates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except it does seem to be appropriate to
spike patients' medicine that's already
[SPEAKER_05]: whole plant with CBD isolate to just get
that aspect way up within the bed of the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we should try it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's high safety.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all about clinical safety and
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you have the risk-benefit ratio is
appropriate, then you should do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this is how a lot of these things
are being done.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a new frontier.
[SPEAKER_12]: I try to use the latest studies that I can
find to inform the treatment that I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can track patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the whole beauty of clinical
observation.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how cannabis in medicine was
described 150 years ago in Western
[SPEAKER_12]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was people just dosing it on subjects
like William O'Shaughnessy or Dr. Richard
[SPEAKER_12]: Reynolds or Sir William Osler.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were just doing this kind of,
well, I've got this tincture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what happens to the migrates.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, they went away.
[SPEAKER_12]: How much did I use?
[SPEAKER_12]: So because I got really good safety
information, I would be happy that as long
[SPEAKER_12]: as that crystal CBD is coming from a
reliable source, that you know it's clean
[SPEAKER_12]: and free of any toxins, you can definitely
dose that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's a lot of research that
suggests that whole plant CBD,
[SPEAKER_12]: the synergistic effect of that is stronger
than the single chemical.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're going to do that,
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it would be really nice to get more
CBD whole plant available in the shops.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think anyone that can grow should
grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have all my patients who are
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_12]: At least Max and I use their plant counts.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they can trial and error like Kevin
Jordan was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, we have a short one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, first of all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
