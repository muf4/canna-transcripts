[SPEAKER_00]: The radically dysfunctional American
healthcare system programs us to get sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: get on long-term prescriptions,
and get some expensive body scans until
[SPEAKER_00]: we're out of money and benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our healthcare system is in shambles after
the insurance company capture of
[SPEAKER_00]: independent hospitals and the
mismanagement of the COVID pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more people are realizing that
there is no one coming to save us after a
[SPEAKER_00]: life of processed food, alcohol,
stress, and poor sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no greater wealth in keeping your
health or improving your health if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: already at a deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of people find their way
to cannabis medicine after Western
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine has failed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the 10 years I've been helping
patients, nearly everyone who has
[SPEAKER_00]: approached me for direction in cannabis
use has already been spent dry by the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare system and given little to show
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis medicine is still considered a
last resort for most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I propose that we start looking more at
cannabis as a preventative, a potent
[SPEAKER_00]: source of stability, both physically and
emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: For true longevity, cannabis can take some
time to bear fruits, but the results from
[SPEAKER_00]: early and daily use of cannabis offers
rewards that are often described as
[SPEAKER_00]: miraculous by traditional doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pairing daily cannabinoids with whole
foods and less alcohol could possibly be
[SPEAKER_00]: today's fountain of youth.

[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire and I am
your host, Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guest today is neuroscientist and
cannabinoid researcher, Hunter Land,
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunter Land is the vice president of
research and development at
[SPEAKER_00]: Biopharmaceutical Research Company,
one of the few DEA Schedule I FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant cannabinoid research and
development companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has 20 years of R&D expertise across 25
different indications as well as 12 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an expert in the field of cannabinoid
science, he has developed a pipeline of
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery work on over 20 novel
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, Dr. Land acted as the senior
scientific director, director of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid research, and scientific
spokesperson at Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably, though, he was GW Pharma's
first full-time R&D employee in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States where he played a critical role in
the development of Epidiolex and Sativex
[SPEAKER_00]: and co-authored multiple protocols for the
treatment of refractory epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sclerosis, and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Land has presented at over 50
scientific conferences, is a named
[SPEAKER_00]: inventor on nine patent applications,
and has over 20 publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunter serves as guest lecturer at the
University of Wisconsin and the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Colorado Skagg School of Pharmacy and
holds other important positions including
[SPEAKER_00]: chief scientific officer for the National
Hockey League alumni, scientific board
[SPEAKER_00]: member of the Veterinary Cannabis Society,
and member of the advisory board for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Council of Federal Cannabis Regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to the folks at Medicinal
Genomics who shared Hunter's presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: on longevity at CanMed 2023 this year on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: CanMed deserves a lot of credit for making
these presentations public and not
[SPEAKER_00]: gatekeeping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find links to Hunter's and all the
other CanMed presentations on the Shaping
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire website page for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the first set today, we will
discuss what longevity is in practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mechanics of aging at the metabolic
level, how increasing cellular energetics
[SPEAKER_00]: improves your health span, and how the
endocannabinoid system plays a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: role in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chunky second set is devoted to
discussing individual cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: their longevity benefits on particular
health systems, functional cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios, and how to go about determining an
individualized dosing strategy to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: your goals, including a vibrant discussion
of using whole plant resin versus
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the third short set,
we will focus specifically on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: cautions to consider when taking
cannabinoids to extend your functional
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting right into it, one of the
things I like about your presentations is
[SPEAKER_00]: you make this very delicate delineation
about lifespan and health span,
[SPEAKER_00]: because so often people just think about,
how long will I live?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I get older, I realize that there's
a lot of difference in quality of life if
[SPEAKER_00]: I get older and sicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you tease those apart for us so
that you kind of set us up for the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction we're headed in today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a critical distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living a really long life but not a robust
life filled with activity is certainly a
[SPEAKER_01]: shortcoming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to have the situation
where we can live well over 100 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but our last 30 years, we're unable to do
the things, the normal activities of daily
[SPEAKER_01]: living that we enjoy that goes to quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of us researchers, we don't just
look at how long something could keep you
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the quality of life there in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interesting enough, that kind of
middle set of health span measures,
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly around activity level, seems to
feed quite well into lifespan generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those who maintain health and health
span measures in the middle of life often,
[SPEAKER_01]: as an extension of that, extend lifespan
quite significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those who extend lifespan often
don't have this prolonged unfortunate lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of activity at the terminal years of their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely gives us the idea that
in one way, it might be better to live a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher quality, shorter life than a longer
life that's lower quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're really getting sicker
the last 20 years, it's like increasingly
[SPEAKER_00]: being in a prison, and yet you're still
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the goal ultimately would be both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can achieve both with some
level of intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen an extensive change in
lifespan, if you go back maybe 100 to 150
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Average life expectancy was about 35
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was riddled with problems around giving
birth, infections, lack of surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have those things, and we've
been able to extend life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, the health span remains
to be problematic in those middle years of
[SPEAKER_01]: life and ultimately impact age-related
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that we need to convince
very many people that living a long and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy life is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably going to be our easiest
thing to try to convince people of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move right on to the part that
the endocannabinoid system can play in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with how I normally
explain the endocannabinoid system just
[SPEAKER_00]: because patients dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'm going to ask you to give us a
more elaborate scientific explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to people who have never come across
the endocannabinoid system before,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that it's very similar to
being a second grade teacher in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the teacher in the room,
and you've got all these students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the teacher's in the room,
all the kids are pretty much doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if the teacher gets called out of
the room, the kids might be good for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, one kid cracks up,
and then another kid cracks up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all the kids are cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually, the teacher comes
back in the room and has to settle
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our endocannabinoid system is in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the endocannabinoid system gets
weakened, eventually one of the systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that it moderates will go bad,
and then another one will, and another
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be different systems that are
falling out of balance for different
[SPEAKER_00]: people first, but the chaos increases as
they run into each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that explanation would certainly never
fly at one of your science and scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would appreciate it if you would
explain in a more scientific way how the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system acts as the body's
master regulator for all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: mission-critical systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I think the analogy is really
interesting and suitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of it generally,
the endocannabinoid system, as the rest,
[SPEAKER_01]: relax, restore system of the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was something that Ethan
Russo, one of my mentors, refers to it as,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it's a good representation of
how that system works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the brain, the
cannabinoid-1 receptors, these are
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors that THC is an agonist or
activates these receptors, as well as your
[SPEAKER_01]: own body's cannabinoids, or endogenous
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's essentially how the system
functions, is by either local activation,
[SPEAKER_01]: your own body, your body's endocannabinoid
system, or by external cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC, I think, is one of the best
examples of what we would call a partial
[SPEAKER_01]: agonist at CB1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an easy way to think of this,
again, not trying to go in too much
[SPEAKER_01]: detail, but your brain, it has
neurotransmitters that signal for effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things can be, certain
neurotransmitters may act like stimulants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think caffeine, and other
neurotransmitters may act like
[SPEAKER_01]: benzodiazepines, so think Xanax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are signaling pathways,
but if you get too much release of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulant component, so that's glutamate,
or the benzodiazepine, the Xanax-like
[SPEAKER_01]: component, which would be GABA,
things can go awry, because we don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: these systems to be out of control,
just like your second graders in the
[SPEAKER_01]: classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second grade teacher, so to speak,
would be your endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which actually tells these
neurotransmitters to settle down,
[SPEAKER_01]: to calm down, so not release as much of
this neurotransmitter, essentially like a
[SPEAKER_01]: reset switch for those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting component is this happens
on a very localized level, so you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: reprimanding the whole classroom,
your body doesn't punish all the kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: if only two of them are bad, it only
focuses on those two bad children,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the small section of neurotransmission
that's gone awry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important difference here is when you
take a exogenous cannabinoid, so like THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can down-regulate all of that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stimulation and the inhibitory,
or the Xanax-like effect, which can be
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic if you use too much,
then that's where you get massive anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: and paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very particular system that can
be regulated well on its own, and in many
[SPEAKER_01]: cases may need to be regulated,
or people can benefit from regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: using something like THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not gonna dwell too much on the
mechanics, but I do have a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to go down this path before we
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often we will talk about certain
cannabinoids being an agonist or an
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonist, and my understanding is an
agonist essentially is turning on
[SPEAKER_00]: something, or an antagonist is turning off
something, and often lay people will talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this or that cannabinoid turning on
or off a receptor causing a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: effect or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really like that black and white,
zero and one, do these antagonists and
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonists really just flip a switch and
it's either A or B, or is it more analog
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a range of how much it is
being agonized or antagonized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, there's a tremendous
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could probably do a show on just
that component or just that question,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think we'll skip some of those
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the degree to which you stimulate or
agonize a receptor or block it can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful or it can be more gentle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC is not a very potent agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a sledgehammer for your CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some synthetic cannabinoids like
Spice and K2 that are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: inebriating and very potent and very
dangerous and can cause a lot of side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also antagonists, so at lower
doses THCV, so similar to THC but with two
[SPEAKER_01]: less carbons on the tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be an antagonist, so it can
actually block your endocannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: may lead to a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a drug called Romanabant that
was designed to be an antagonist and
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately it's something we call
inverse agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like THC, I think is the
important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened with that particular
drug is it caused increased suicidal
[SPEAKER_01]: ideation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were depressed, some people were
depressed and some people had suicidal
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also lost weight and seemed to help
regulate blood sugar and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your point of how strong something is
at either blocking a receptor or
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulating a receptor, especially as it
relates to medicine and health outcomes is
[SPEAKER_01]: of critical importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So circling this mechanics conversation
back to this idea of longevity and that
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger holistic picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about the endocannabinoids,
the endocannabinoid system and its ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn on and off different systems,
to bring them into balance, things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are running hot, it can have it settle
down or if something is too sluggish,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can suddenly be stimulated by the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us, folks who are cannabis
enthusiasts but are not researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we throw around the ideas of the CB1 and
CB2 receptor pretty liberally,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if not necessarily scientifically
accurate, just so that we can generally
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to dose ourselves one way
or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that CBD doesn't really act
upon those receptors and yet we still
[SPEAKER_00]: consider it part of the endocannabinoid
system, which clearly suggests that the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system is made up of more
than just these neurotransmitters and
[SPEAKER_00]: these two receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know again, it would be an entire
show to ask you to review all of the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm looking for is for you to
just give us a quick survey of who makes
[SPEAKER_00]: up the endocannabinoid system,
like what parts, because in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show, we're going to be talking
about how we're working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure that people
understand the reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the endocannabinoid system,
the endocannabinoid system is heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated with so many other systems in
your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can couple or affect upstream,
downstream things like serotonin,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is associated with depression,
dopamine, which I think we're all well
[SPEAKER_01]: versed in what dopamine, actions of
dopamine are, but also critical roles in
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation and mood, sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's heavily integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I personally like to think of the
endocannabinoid system in a classical
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just CB1 and CB2 in the endogenous
ligands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabinoids that your body makes
and then the transporters, whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to get these from point A
to point B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all targets for potential
making of medicines and maybe plant
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules modulating these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you go outside of that, then you
start calling a lot of different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, TRIP receptors,
TRP receptors, especially TRIP V1 we know
[SPEAKER_01]: is activated by cannabinoids and sometimes
desensitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same receptor for the spicy
taste, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually an ion channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just an example of another
system altogether that cannabinoids can
[SPEAKER_01]: function at, but isn't necessarily what I
would consider the classical
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, there are tons of
targets, especially for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there are about 68 different
targets, meaning places where CBD may work
[SPEAKER_01]: or function in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost all of those are outside of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same can be said for probably at
least 100 of the other phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: found in cannabis, that their principal
role is probably not CB1 or CB2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way of summary, will you make the
case for me real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the case that for somebody wanting to
increase their health span, why working
[SPEAKER_00]: with the endocannabinoid system is a great
place for you to be working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the endocannabinoid system
is, as I mentioned, the rest, relax,
[SPEAKER_01]: restore system of the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its importance around inflammation and the
immune system is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we think about age-related
diseases, a lot of these are mediated by
[SPEAKER_01]: our body's inflammatory response,
autoimmune response, and things that have
[SPEAKER_01]: gone awry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your body's able to keep these
components in check, then maybe you do
[SPEAKER_01]: have better health span and lifespan
measures by just keeping everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: this nice balance of where it should be in
homeostasis and not outside of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that certainly has strong
potential for extending life and activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, I think there's a big role
for cannabinoids and endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoids around mitochondrial
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mitochondria, if you remember back to
grade school, are the powerhouse of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as these things go into decline,
you have problems with cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: energetics, which if you don't have energy
for your engine of your cell, then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything starts to go awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about cannabis medicine
and all the things that it can help,
[SPEAKER_00]: people new to cannabis medicine will also
often have this reaction that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you think cannabis is a panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just cure everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing can cure that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I tell them is it really only
helps one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps balance the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue is that all of your body's
systems play into the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, the cannabis plant really has
one job, which is to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, I always think of it as
the only thing that you can do other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system that can have
such far-reaching effects to heal and
[SPEAKER_00]: restore the human body is eating a whole
foods diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that, too, reaches every part of
your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that set for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I would like to say is
cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know that there are,
I think last time I checked, about 545
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially active compounds that can be
found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we estimate right now there may be up
to 150 different phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we use cannabis as just a plant,
it is a very unique plant because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds it produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things like terpenes,
and terpenoids, and flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously cannabinoids, as well as a
lot of components that we're not even
[SPEAKER_01]: really well-versed in as of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science hasn't really directed us to
examine all these components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that being said, the complexity
is which of these components works well,
[SPEAKER_01]: where, and how does that affect disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to your point, if we're talking THC and
some of the other cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: then endocannabinoid system may be
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at something like CBD,
I would make an argument for the principal
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of our action are not directly
related, maybe upstream or downstream,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not directly related to the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, another level of complexity to a
very, very complex situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with your statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: About food, I have a deep interest in
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also add exercise and potentially
fasting to that as having a systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial effect to treat multiple
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard you talk before about the aging
process as part of this overall topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: living a longer, healthier life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people often talk about the body's
clock and how you can turn back the clock
[SPEAKER_00]: or stop the clock or different ways that
people use that turn of phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious, at a biomechanical level,
what does the body's clock, what is that
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: In passing, I've heard people say,
oh, folate is the body's clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't actually know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of components to
dive into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about body's clock,
a lot of this has to do with their
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds within cells called sirtuins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they regulate something called
epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think of the genetics as kind
of the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the epigenetics can either cover
portions of the recipe or uncover them for
[SPEAKER_01]: production of critical components for
health span and lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your body basically looks at the recipe
and makes what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, those recipes get damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the degree that cannabinoids play a
role, interacting with these sirtuins and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping regulate these genes isn't
incredibly clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when people, largely when
people talk about their body's clock,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're thinking about how this
information gets damaged over time and
[SPEAKER_01]: then measuring links of things called
telomeres, where you can get kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: biological age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to map, some of these
compounds seem to map with biological age,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very different than chronological
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to summarize that,
like if I was talking to a friend or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody, I would say that when we're
young or when we're born, our body is born
[SPEAKER_00]: with a set of recipes to make various
chemicals and parts that make us human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we get older, the recipe book
starts to get corrupted over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the recipes don't get made right
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the functioning continues
to degrade until the souffle flattens and
[SPEAKER_00]: we die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that one way to say what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I think that's one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start out making chocolate chip
cookies and at the end, they don't look
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like chocolate chip cookies
because you've got this disrupted recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other component has to do with,
cellular energetics and also the cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting rid of the bad and coming in
with the new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also gets damaged over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body's ability to heal, which I think
everybody can agree that an 80 year old
[SPEAKER_01]: individual does not have the same ability
to heal their injured knee as a 10 year
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ability declines over time for
multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that is your own body's
adaptation to cleansing the bad and
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in the new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If as we age, the recipes are getting
corrupted and what we want is thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular energetics so that we have a
longer health span.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that is degrading these recipes
that potent cellular energetics is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: undo or defend against?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are investigating this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are some people that just
have great genetics from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: These Centenarians that live over a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them have smoked cigarettes their
whole life and maybe drink too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were just blessed with this
genetic predisposition of just having this
[SPEAKER_01]: really robust genetic system that takes
care of the health of their DNA and their
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for most of us, we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things that we can control are
largely environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we put in our body,
the amount of rest and sleep that we get,
[SPEAKER_01]: the toxins that may be around us,
and activity level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that pretty much sums up the
outcomes of how well we can maintain these
[SPEAKER_01]: recipes and the cellular health as we age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ironic that even though the
underlying point of the discussion today
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing and using cannabis medicine as
a supplement can increase your health and
[SPEAKER_00]: your health span.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it's not lost on me that
we keep on coming back to the best thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can do for your health span is to
eat well, sleep well, and exercise,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for maybe whole foods more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are free things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that don't cost money,
and yet they're the hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are all like, I still want
to stay up too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still like to eat like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to exercise,
but I would really like to buy this bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of vitamins and just eat these and get
away with living my crappy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that with modern medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, some patients that are
diabetic may be able to manage it with
[SPEAKER_01]: diet and exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a physician, so consult your
physician before you do any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could, in the early stages,
potentially be managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's much easier to take a pill or a
shot or take a medication than to put all
[SPEAKER_01]: that effort into controlling something
more naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, we certainly recommend
a whole foods diet, exercise, and good
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also want to be able to do the best
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to continue the
conversation now and talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what their mechanics look like in the
body to support this increasing health
[SPEAKER_00]: span that we want to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yeah, there's 545 compounds and 150
phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, we're not going to go through
them all today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really think we need to
either, because for most listeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really only going to have access to
CBD, THC, CBG, and then whole plant resins
[SPEAKER_00]: that will have a smattering of these other
phyto-cannabinoids in it, which we may not
[SPEAKER_00]: even know about, because they might not be
testing for them in the COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so let's just focus on these,
because this is what people really have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to keep this relevant to real
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you've already started talking
about CBD, and the plethora of targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said 68 or something,
something way bigger than most people take
[SPEAKER_00]: for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start with CBD,
and then I'm going to hit all of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's start with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that we are hoping that CBD
does?
[SPEAKER_00]: When people ask me, I just generally say,
we want the CBD supplement that we get
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant to reduce or replace an
endogenous cannabinoid that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: making, or that we're depleted in,
or we don't have enough of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our body doesn't have enough,
and so we take CBD to replace it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it helps keep things in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you discuss it as a cannabinoid
researcher?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would discuss it a little bit different,
because most of my work around CBD has
[SPEAKER_01]: been in treating disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And primarily, at least the initial work
I've done with CBD was in epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically a lot of refractory childhood
epilepsies, like Gervais and
[SPEAKER_01]: Lennox-Gastaut, where these children had
failed 14 different modern medications,
[SPEAKER_01]: and were on three or four, and still
having hundreds of seizures a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see CBD is quite effective,
generally reducing about 50% of seizures,
[SPEAKER_01]: with some patients being seizure-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't work like these other
anti-epileptic drugs, or these
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-seizure drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the really clear component is that
we know that it is safe and effective for
[SPEAKER_01]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these doses are much higher than what
you would take CBD as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the clinical trials, patients were
taking between 500 and 1,500, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: more milligrams of CBD a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, would that be lower if it was a whole
plant extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would have to be lower,
because the whole plant extracts contain
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that be better?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly possible that it would be
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, we would really need to do that
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is also an anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you and your listeners probably
know, if you're getting a whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, the overwhelming majority of them
still have some THC present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which may be of benefit to some patients
with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be pro-convulsant to some
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be of critical importance to
areas like pain, and maybe areas like
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as you go down in doses, there's been
some evidence that CBD is a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful anxiolytic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that for things like public
speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't done any work with podcasting
yet, but maybe that's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do see that the anxiety tends to go
down in several studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be at lower doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bring that dose down further to,
let's say, 25 milligrams, there really
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been a lot of research to say,
what do these low doses do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it may not be doing
much at low doses, or it may be that it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a long time to see those effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you eat a healthy diet,
or you take certain nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: supplements, you may not see that
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be down the road where you see
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are things that are very
difficult to look at, and very expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at in a scientific setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often talk about psilocybin on this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the whole idea behind
microdosing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you just take a little bit every
day, and so the materials are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the constancy over time that
allows for the neurogenesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that always gets me
about CBD, though, where I'm asking you
[SPEAKER_00]: about the function of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as somebody who's looking for longevity
knows what the CBD is doing for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't really discriminate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gets into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's almost like, all right,
I can't tell you specifically what CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do for you and how soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you that CBD does so much
good for so many different systems that
[SPEAKER_00]: you should just take it and just let it
decide where it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you have multiple mechanisms,
multiple ways of having some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, if there's one area that's not
problematic, it may not modulate that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular system, which potentially could
give benefit if there's another area where
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs modulation or activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your point earlier that I kind of
glossed over, CBD is relevant to the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of study about it being
a negative allosteric modulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning it can reduce the ability for
things like THC to attach to that
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some other things like it
boosts your endocannabinoids, your body's
[SPEAKER_01]: own cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are kind of difficult to
really understand if that's really a
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the really interesting studies
that I think has just been published was
[SPEAKER_01]: in Fragile X, which is a type of seizure
disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these patients have disruptive
endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it appears that CBD was able to
restore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be because CBD may prevent the
internalization, so basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: disappearance of the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of a tree that gets sucked back
down into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the tree is gone, then it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of molecule you have to stick to
that particular receptor, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: there to activate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is possible that CBD may prevent
some of this internalization, which would
[SPEAKER_01]: be good for the endocannabinoid system as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that we can describe several
different cannabinoids in that similar
[SPEAKER_00]: way, where they can participate in several
different ways, in several different
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know that CBG, cannabigerol,
actually does different things than CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, would you make a delineation and
explain to us what is different about CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: than CBD, and how you have found it
acting, or what the state of the science
[SPEAKER_00]: is for CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though most cannabis
enthusiasts are relatively new to CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers have been jumping on it as the
exciting new novel cannabinoid for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really interesting molecule
to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is available, which some of these other
minor cannabinoids are not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is quite distinct from both THC and
CBD and mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: For your listeners, they probably know
that CBGA, the acid form, is considered
[SPEAKER_01]: the mother of all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: After CBG, the cannabis plant produces THC
or CBDA, which we know very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a principal component in a lot
of available cultivars of cannabis now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes it easy for us, or at least
easier for us to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also not a schedule one compound,
so labs don't have to have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: certifications to examine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not been available that long,
so we don't know nearly as much about CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: as we do THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily, we know that they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do know that there's some
unique properties for CBG around immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system regulation and around there's
something called nucleotide receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are things that are activated on
the nucleus of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be very important for coding
things that your body produces that are of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit or preventing things from being
coded that are problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the theme for the day is health span
and longevity, will you speak a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBG's activity on the immune system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we do see down regulation in a lot
of things that are potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic, like tumor necrosis factor
and interleukin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which can be kind of broadly destructive
and are common in a lot of disease states,
[SPEAKER_01]: autoimmune related disease states that
result in pain and neurodegeneration,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do know that it has activity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing will be to learn,
does that in combination with other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, does that have a additive or
super additive effect that can really help
[SPEAKER_01]: treat some of these diseases and
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks who haven't come across that
vocabulary before, I'd like you to briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: explain additive and more specifically
super additive because we continually make
[SPEAKER_00]: the case for people to consider finding
either whole plant or built cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines that have several of these
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea of the sum being better,
being more effective than the parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people, I want people to be able
to wrap their heads around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people talk about the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting topic and we do
see, I like to think of the entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effect is super additive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that would mean, so let's take a
step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So additive, I think of additive as very
simply as one plus one equals two,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're taking, let's say two
medications and one of them reduces your
[SPEAKER_01]: pain by half or let's say 20% and the
other one by itself would reduce pain by
[SPEAKER_01]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take them together and you get a
40% reduction in pain, then that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: additive, one plus one equals two,
which is benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you may not be able to take
medication one at a higher dose because it
[SPEAKER_01]: may be toxic or maybe it just doesn't work
beyond reducing 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with medication too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this additive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes we see these synergies where
we have two different medications and they
[SPEAKER_01]: both reduce something by 20%, but you put
them together and instead of a 40%
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction, you get a 80% reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I would call super
additive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that with cannabinoids,
you may be able to combine these or they
[SPEAKER_01]: may exist already in the plant to where by
themselves they would do nothing or they
[SPEAKER_01]: would help somewhat, but when combined,
they do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what the entourage
effect is defining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be cannabinoids with other
things that aren't cannabinoids as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: like terpenes or flavonoids like
canflavins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really sure, but I do think it's
important to outline that cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, sometimes they seem to work
well together and you get this additive or
[SPEAKER_01]: super additive effect and sometimes they
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen that with CBD and THC and
glaucoma, where using them together
[SPEAKER_01]: actually prevents the benefits or the
decrease in the pressure in the eye of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, which is relevant for glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's great to combine these
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to know what we're combining,
why we're combining it and who's it for
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's the purpose of them taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can probably better understand
the potential for having these additive or
[SPEAKER_01]: super additive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one more CBG question before
we go to our first commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, we have been aware of CBD,
cannabidiol for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's now a substantial and growing body
of research on it, where, except for in
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme circumstances, we're pretty
confident that CBD is pretty much good for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have to be concerned about
taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll help us or not, but it's
unlikely to hurt us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about CBG,
like we're just learning the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly anecdotally, we know about
how great it is for things like anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: and neuropathy and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we know so much less about it,
do we know yet that CBG can be generally
[SPEAKER_00]: regarded as safe for everybody,
where even though it hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: researched fully yet, where we're to the
point like, listen, we know CBD is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG is a lot like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not medical advice to anybody out
there who's thinking of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we can say it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that in the work I've done,
both in C.
[SPEAKER_01]: elegans and rodents, side by side with
CBD, I found CBG to be better tolerated at
[SPEAKER_01]: very high doses than I have CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these are animal models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tox work usually translates fairly well to
humans, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if you remember years
ago, there was this drug, this company
[SPEAKER_01]: called Bile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were making a drug for modulating
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pha inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked great in rodents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they put it in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three patients had brain death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't expect that that is going to
happen with CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't always know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we certainly don't know the test,
the level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tested the level to where we
can go with CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas there's not really an LD50,
a lethal dose that kills 50% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: No known reported deaths other than I
think a guy got smashed by cannabis in his
[SPEAKER_01]: car.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a car accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that might be related.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in CBD also seems very safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Acutely, we've given patients like 6,000
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are concerns with high doses and the
impact on liver, especially with other
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs like valproic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done any of that work with CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as well known in humans like
what doses we could go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, though, I think it looks like a
very promising molecule in terms of both
[SPEAKER_01]: safety and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG just has such amazing effects
specifically for anxiety in the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when CBD doesn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, have you tried CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, oh, wow,
that actually worked a lot better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things I like about
cannabis is individualized medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next our next cannabinoid we're
going to talk about is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's do that after the commercial
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a short break and
be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is neuroscientist
Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without these advertisers,
Shaping Fire would not happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please support them and let them know
you heard them on Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online cannabis seed distributors often
seem to be all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Multiverse Beans constantly works to
provide you with cannabis seeds and a
[SPEAKER_00]: buying experience that you won't find
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse Beans works directly with the
breeders to secure as many packs of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites as possible so that they have
your favorite beans long after others have
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shops simply buy breeder minimums.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get messages all the time from
breeders saying some version of Multiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: asked to buy my entire run.
[SPEAKER_00]: At multiversebeans.com, you can find rare
cannabis seeds from night owl seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the dark owl sub label,
Mephisto Genetics, Square One Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin Hood Seeds, and Ethos and so many
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse also initiates projects with
breeders to secure exclusive packs that
[SPEAKER_00]: you simply won't find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse founder Paul Lahl sees himself
not only as a curator of the best cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds available, but also as a
collaborator with breeders trying to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: novel crosses to the market that his
customers are asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse Beans also creates exclusive
stickers for their popular seed varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available free only when you

[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses everywhere are striving to
reach people through advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know, though, that trying to reach
a cannabis audience with a quality message
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many people choose to advertise
on the Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product, service,
[SPEAKER_00]: or brand in a way that really lets people
know what sets your company apart from
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers is essential, and that is what
we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will explain your service or product,
what sets it apart as desirable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help our audience get in contact with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising does not have to be all
whiz-bang, smoke, and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I find that people prefer just
to be spoken to calmly, accurately,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna make your own commercial spot
well, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: During these pandemic days, conventions
and cannabis events are pretty poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: attended, but podcast listening is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a commercial on Shaping Fire,
you'll reach your customers in the privacy
[SPEAKER_00]: of their headphones right now,
and will continue to reach new listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: as they explore the Shaping Fire back
catalog of episodes again and again for
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spot on Shaping Fire costs less than a
printed postcard per person, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire audience is full of smart
cannabis enthusiasts, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: and entrepreneurs who are always curious
to learn.

[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_00]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be fun, sure, but so many
varieties in one pack is a sign of an
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seed line that hasn't been worked
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer my auto flowers to be worked
enough that each pheno in the pack really
[SPEAKER_00]: captures the aspects that the breeder was
intending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I recommend Gnome Automatics
to my friends and listeners who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnome automatic seeds are not just crossed
and released.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are painstakingly sifted again and
again, tested in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, and taken to a level of
maturity that each plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable by its traits, traits that
were hard earned so that you can have your
[SPEAKER_00]: best growth cycle ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 10 years, Gnome Automatics
founder Dan Jimmy has become a trusted
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, and he continues to pour his
passion of breeding cannabis into every
[SPEAKER_00]: variety he raises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Gnome Automatics Instagram
at gnome underscore automatics to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive plants folks are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can score Gnome Automatics seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_00]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial cannabis farms across the
country love growing Gnome Automatics
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their consistency from seed to
seed, short grow times, THC percentages,
[SPEAKER_00]: and colorful bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms interested in bulk seeds of more
than a thousand should reach out through
[SPEAKER_00]: gnomeautomatics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: While on the website, be sure to check out
the Gnome Automatics shirts and other
[SPEAKER_00]: merch section too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want reliable seeds, hand-built
from effort, expert selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and experience, choose Gnome Automatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to Shaping Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Los, and my guest
today is neuroscientist Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pick back up right where we were
with THC targets or THC's functionality,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we talked a lot about our
familiarity and the substantial body of
[SPEAKER_00]: research we have in CBD, cannabidiol,
and then how we have less research in CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're already seeing all of these
fantastic results anecdotally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're starting to see them in the lab
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, THC, which is the cannabinoid that
most people love first in cannabis when
[SPEAKER_00]: they get turned on to it, it acts in very
different ways than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, most of them that we really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you start with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're taking THC with longevity and
wellness in mind, what are the functions
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC that we're looking to include in
the mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in terms of longevity,
we haven't seen anything that would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that THC is overtly poor for longevity,
and we haven't seen any major problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with acute toxicity or neurotoxicity at
relevant doses, and there could certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: be some protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's just not incredibly clear
on how specifically that may help with
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity, other than maybe some
neuroprotection and autoimmune-type
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially where we stand right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hit on that autoimmune component
real quickly, because autoimmune disease
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably becoming way more common,
but it is at least becoming more commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what action does THC take in that
realm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there have been some studies,
especially around like rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_01]: arthritis and things of that nature,
where we've seen clinical benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there have been some studies
preclinically that have outlined some
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit around these cytokines,
so these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of indiscriminately kill cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's difficult to make that
broad leap to say that THC is certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: going to extend lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you have a condition,
like let's say, and we don't know this
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically, so just to be clear,
the FDA hasn't approved THC or THC
[SPEAKER_01]: components for anxiety conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say that as many people do often
share that it helps with anxiety or sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: then by helping those components,
by helping with sleep or pain sensation or
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety, you may indirectly or downstream
effects may be that you have improved
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of life, that you have better
activities of daily living, that you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better as a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all feeds into this kind of
health span category, which ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: could feed into lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often suggest to patients who are having
inflammatory issues that doing a CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant blend with THC so you get the
anti-inflammation properties of both is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that would be the primary
longevity advantage to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we still seeing that in the research
that THC is still considered a beast when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to decreasing inflammation?
[SPEAKER_01]: In some models, we do see that THC is an
effective anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see similar effects with CBD and
some really interesting effects with
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go down a rabbit hole
here, but CBD-A is the acid version that
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs naturally in the plant before we
heat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think both THC-A, again the acid
version in the plant before it's heated or
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call decarboxylated, seem to be
really important for those inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the conversation that we're
having about THC and how the different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that it can do at different levels,
this would be a really good time for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: address the biphasic nature of
cannabinoids because I think that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: most obvious to most early users when it
comes to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you review that for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, I'm so glad you brought it up
because I think this is probably one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the more critical components of being able
to use, especially use THC for its
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to treat disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you look at the literature
and you look at self-reports, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients will say THC at lower doses help
my anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's approved for increasing
appetite and multiple indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it helps with nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's also clear is this biphasic
effect where as you go up, then you lose
[SPEAKER_01]: those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, you induce the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low levels, anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: High levels, massive paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low levels, increase appetite,
reduce nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: High levels, vomiting and nausea,
the spins, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is this therapeutic window that I
think is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just unique to cannabis and
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also common in like Robitussin,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be effective as an expectorant to
help you breathe if you have a cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe with cough and congestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you drink the bottle, you're
probably going to hallucinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where THC sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difficult thing around THC is,
we mentioned it earlier, is this
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got two things in patients that
are a little bit confounding when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is, how many CB1 receptors do
they have and where are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's why certain people can take
high doses of cannabis and they're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people will take it and
they'll have a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be very prone to anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably based on the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly is, if you're consuming
it orally, metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not speaking like metabolism,
like how fit are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about these compounds that are
in your liver, as well as elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: but primarily in your liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called cytochrome P450s,
or SIP enzymes for short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they break down a lot of plant-derived
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the result is is the components,
the outcome, so to speak, of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure it gets to your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain people just can't break down
THC very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get very, very high levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people are rapid metabolizers
and they break it down really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to juggle these two things in
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no way of looking at somebody
and saying, oh, you're going to break this
[SPEAKER_01]: down really quickly, so I need to give you
a higher dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have more CB1 receptors on your
pathways that result in anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to be more careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much in what you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back a little ways, I will say
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do not have to comment on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has been a long time since I've
thought about robo-tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about drinking the whole bottle
of Robitussin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was a young freelance,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacist, if you will, in college,
it was something that we heard you could
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to get the right kind and
all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really unpleasant for your gut
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But gosh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't thought about that in 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is when we're talking
about each person is going to have their
[SPEAKER_00]: own, I don't know what you'd call it,
but a biphasic threshold for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another good reason why
when people start to use cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time that includes THC,
that you always start low and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you may be particularly sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's better to start slow and work
your way up based on an actual plan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: results you want instead of just assuming
you're going to be fine and starting high
[SPEAKER_00]: and then having to pay the piper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when THC goes from jolly good and
relaxing to, oh my god, I'm freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do I need to call paramedics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely think you might.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really bad day at the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-induced psychosis is pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've witnessed some high dose THC studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA in some cases wants you to do high
dose studies to figure out where this
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be quite scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did some of that work with
Sativex, patients had to be sedated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember earlier when we were talking
about GABA, the benzo-like effect being
[SPEAKER_01]: cut off by CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons that you get
this anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the treatments to prevent that
is to give benzos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's often what can happen in
hospital settings when patients get this
[SPEAKER_01]: massive paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who don't know what
Sativex is, it's basically a 50-50 blend
[SPEAKER_01]: of two different plants, high THC and high
CBD plant, that was used in clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the research that we have
around cannabinoids is based on that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular medicine that's approved in
about 28 countries, but not in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they did those trials,
as they continued to learn about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had a self-titration built into the
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something I worked on in a
good bit of depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would see patients kind of all over
the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some would have six administrations a day,
and some would have 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could never look at them and tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we asked them to balance the safety
and efficacy, so to go up to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where they felt like it was helping and
they weren't getting bad side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good rule of thumb if
you're using THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually going to the point where you're
intoxicated may be negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some evidence that when you get
really high, you increase sensation to
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And increase sensation to feeling in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you go back to the 60s when a
lot of cannabis was being used at music
[SPEAKER_01]: festivals, I don't know that they were
doing it to decrease sensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may be that lower doses are better
for treating pain than intoxicating doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to take a sidebar because you
mentioned a topic that I'm very interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in and that it's very hard to find
information on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is rapid metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only learned about rapid metabolizers
about four years ago or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it explains a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to set it up in a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd just like you to speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in cannabis, it is very common for
people to have dumb internet arguments
[SPEAKER_00]: about dosage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Russo is talking about optimum
doses for THC, well under 20% for nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whereas other times, I'll watch
somebody eat a 200 milligram edible of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, how in the hell is that even
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And okay, if somebody is a long-term
chronic pain patient, certainly tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: can be made up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes these people are like
newbies, and they're just eating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't seem to phase them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really understand that there
were these rapid metabolizer people until
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a whole family of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was aware of their cannabis usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the doses that they were telling me
that they were taking for their various
[SPEAKER_00]: issues were like, as far as I was
concerned, they were off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were to relax after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who was relatively new was taking
80 milligrams of THC and RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be crying at 80 milligrams,
let alone without my tolerance that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got from years of use, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was at a music event on the
island with one of the people in this
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched them eat five grams of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, I'm a rapid
metabolizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body just metabolizes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have any fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, A, you're lucky because
taking a heroic dose like that without
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing it your first time could also be a
really bad day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's weird because rapid metabolizers,
they explain a lot of these kind of black
[SPEAKER_00]: swan events that as somebody who is trying
to support people to learn about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine specifically, but the wider field
of entheogens as well, these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: their biology breaks the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you just speak to the,
I don't know, the metabolics of rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly common that a proportion in
these trials will have rapid metabolizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually a test that we can
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about $450.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be tested to find out which
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the enzymes are the components that
break down these plant compounds as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as other compounds like drugs in the
liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look and you can say,
oh, wow, I have a really elevated or I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: most likely to metabolize drugs that are
through the 3A4 pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CYP3A4 or 2C19.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of these different
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could say, pretty definitively
say, if you take these drugs, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to take higher levels or they're
not going to work because as soon as they
[SPEAKER_01]: get to your liver, they're going to be
broken down immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also have the opposite effect
where a lot of patients will break them
[SPEAKER_01]: down very slowly and they have to go with
ultra low doses to avoid toxicity and side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other interesting component here too
is that kind of levels goes on with this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the food effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So administration in let's say a gummy
could be very different than
[SPEAKER_01]: administration with fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that with THC, if it's taken with
a high fat meal, you increase exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: three to five fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings on another level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this endocannabinoid tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got how quickly or slowly are
they metabolizing THC or other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then did they take it with food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then we've increased the levels
that wouldn't normally be there if you
[SPEAKER_01]: took it on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets pretty complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is another good argument
for one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because your friend is taking this
other particular blend of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's working for them doesn't mean that
specific blend is going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to start with the
basics and build up your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine exposure over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also why I recommend that patients
always keep a dosing germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: All for any any entheogens, just so you
remember what worked for you and what
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't, especially what didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just I would say in that
journal, they should also take note of if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something that they're consuming
rather than smoking, they should probably
[SPEAKER_01]: take note of what they had to eat and what
the format was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you take it,
it could be so minor as in if you take it
[SPEAKER_01]: with MCT oil, medium chain triglycerides,
which is what a lot of these products come
[SPEAKER_01]: in versus something like sesame or corn
oil or hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exposure is way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MCT oil kind of carries it great
directly to the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these other fats can can push
some of it into the lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets into the bloodstream,
but without going to the liver first to
[SPEAKER_01]: get broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's I wish it was simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard that about sesame oils
being able to push it into the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: bypassing the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, some proportion of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of the same technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear like seds, like self
emulsifying drug delivery systems or like
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these that are that are used in
beverages or fast acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it's not proven, but there are
some data available that that show that
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this technology can push it
quickly into the lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to wait for it to get
broken down by the liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there's higher levels in your
blood earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to the next cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we already did CBD, CBG and THC,
which are our most readily available for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, regular folks, I'm going to
create a basket of the rest of of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, you know, one that I know
that you've done a lot of research in is a
[SPEAKER_00]: can flavin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there's there's all these other
phyto cannabinoids that that either we
[SPEAKER_00]: won't have the time to talk about today or
there isn't even any research on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like you to generally speak to
them as this for people who prefer whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant resin preparations like,
you know, what we call many people call
[SPEAKER_00]: RSO, Rick Simpson oil, but like a whole a
whole a whole resin extract like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should we wrap our heads around these
these these trace and novel cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that will like all will also be in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be mentioned on the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not going to be tested
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but most many of us who are fans of
whole plant medicine, we like them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there because of a belief that they hold a
synergistic quality, maybe some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: protectant nature from having a bad
experience and an assumption that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably good for us in ways that we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of assumptions in what
I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so, you know, with the goal of
trying to speak to how these extra
[SPEAKER_00]: components play a role in longevity for
people who are going to be designing their
[SPEAKER_00]: own supplementation system, what do you
have to say about these these kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: variables that we can't control,
but we are just assuming they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's I think it's difficult
because it's to some degree, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a mystery soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that mystery soup could be
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that some of the cannabinoids
there, there's one called THCP that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: very small amounts in certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very potent CB1 agonist at low
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may be of critical importance to
some of these botanical extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but having it there or not having it
there could ultimately make a tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you found something that's
a botanical extract that you like and that
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for you, then I wouldn't,
you know, trying to get something
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be down to the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be down to these minor
cannabinoids, can flavins could be of
[SPEAKER_01]: critical importance around inflammatory
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without knowing what that is,
it's difficult to say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this group of other things, this other
mystery soup is going to help or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you could, as I mentioned earlier,
that that that those mystery molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: could be the holy grail to treating a
disease or they could be counteractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this with terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without having it better characterized,
it's it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really tough to say because they're
all so unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap up this particular topic before
we move on, I want to talk briefly about
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mutual friend, Dr. Ethan Russo has
been on shaping fire several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome as it relates to different
[SPEAKER_00]: research that he has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's interesting that,
you know, one of the reasons we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement our body with these phyto
cannabinoids that we are sourcing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant is because our own body is
not producing the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the endogenous cannabinoids that are made
inside of the body properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that the causes for
endocannabinoid deficiency include,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, poor nutrition, poor sleep,
anxiety and immune suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals and, you know,
environmental toxins, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of things that are just
generally not good for our human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm of the opinion that the vast
majority of Americans are are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering from endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I personally think
everybody should be taking some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementation to strengthen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you speak to I don't know if you can
speak to the commonness of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, but would you speak to the
idea of endocannabinoid deficiency as it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to, you know, longevity and and
how, you know, being deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoids will degrade probably
both your length of life and your your
[SPEAKER_00]: health spanned of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's again, it's difficult to say
definitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can both agree and just about
everybody will agree that the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system is critical to
health and can play a major component in a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about
endocannabinoids is they they're they're
[SPEAKER_01]: made on demand and they're metabolized
very quickly, especially most of them
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the brain.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't it would be great if we could
just test you like a regular blood test
[SPEAKER_01]: and draw some blood and say, oh,
you're an andamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be great?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make it so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, the levels in your
blood and how quickly they change based on
[SPEAKER_01]: stress and environment, they don't match
what happens in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have endocannabinoid deficiency
syndrome, so to speak, that affects that's
[SPEAKER_01]: important because remember, these
cannabinoid receptors are also in the
[SPEAKER_01]: periphery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just anxiety and mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be joint pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be inflammatory bowel disease,
something completely unrelated to what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on the CNS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then maybe you could examine this and
get some idea of, you know, a dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen that would help that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for CNS related disorders,
you can't really look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would agree with you that it's the
endocannabinoid system or dysregulation
[SPEAKER_01]: may be a critical component to a lot of
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the cause or is it a symptom?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still very difficult to
determine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do know that it does happen and is
associated with many different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I want to talk about is
how functional ratios between the
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids and how that plays
a role in your overall health span.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, the underlying idea
that I'm suggesting that folks find a
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of cannabinoids that work for them
and then take it as a daily supplement to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep their endocannabinoid strong or their
endocannabinoid system strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of each really does play a role?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've gone in and out of
being behind functional ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was when I was all new to this,
you know, I was I was very into the OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: do we want a 20 to one ratio or is it a
two to one ratio of CBD to THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, you know, this ratio is
for Parkinson's and this ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I realized over time that those
might be good places to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, every person has got their own
functional ratio, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so would you explain how you approach
thinking about ratios from a longevity and
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness perspective as a research
scientist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in terms of longevity and wellness,
we don't know a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the the best, the most recent work
is one of the kind of first examinations
[SPEAKER_01]: around CL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at isolated compounds versus
like this botanical drug substance that
[SPEAKER_01]: contained CBD and CBG and THC together in
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, is that the ideal ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you change that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that translate to humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still in the early stages in
terms of functional race ratios and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they potentially could treat disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a little bit more clear
cut, especially in when not to use certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things or when to keep certain things low
like THC and where it may be better to
[SPEAKER_01]: have higher amounts of THC or or a smaller
ratio with THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that's a little bit more
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, to do this research with so many
different humans who are all different
[SPEAKER_01]: with so many different diseases and so
many different variables is tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's almost like, you know,
it's a case by case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned, you said you kind of
have like certain ratios that you think
[SPEAKER_01]: are ideal for certain diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that may only be the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be able to be further optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on the contrary, there might be certain
conditions where you don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize them very much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may just be that it works at at that
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of that disease state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this this next thought is for
folks who are, you know, so far down the
[SPEAKER_00]: path with this, that they are they're
producing their own medicine, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as as we see when when the
rubber hits the road, when somebody is
[SPEAKER_00]: sick enough and Western medicine has not
been the solution for them and they find
[SPEAKER_00]: their way to cannabis and they find
something that works, it's a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: path from Oh, my gosh, this works a little
bit to suddenly they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing their own plants that are the
types of plants that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're processing it using,
you know, ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are making their own custom
blends that work for their particular
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been great, you know,
over the last, say, five years with the
[SPEAKER_00]: advent of some of these spectacular hemp
varieties that, you know, will isolate one
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid like, you know, the the all
CBD hemp plant that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from Oregon CBDs or the or the all
CBG version, you know, so so you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow these plants and and and make one
make a CBG oil and make a CBD oil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: make your type one plant your THC oil,
you know, make three different oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: then and then blend them like a vintner
would like, you know, blending a red table
[SPEAKER_00]: wine or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's what I had to do
after my brain injury to find something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was going to be a low enough amount
of THC that I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: take it during the day and still be
functioning at my best level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also high levels of CBD I wanted
for for the neurogenesis and the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then then when when it became
available, the CBG plants, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my central nervous system from
running too hot, which which happens to me
[SPEAKER_00]: because of other diagnoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so this idea of hand blending them,
I think is a real is a real winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I guess my my my my I guess I just
would like to hear your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: gap between what patients need,
how patients become citizen scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how so many patients go to the
licensed market for their first medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it doesn't work for them like it
has worked for other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I I'm on board with the idea of
blending to a certain specification from
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there is a limit to what can
be produced in an idealistic ratio from
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's nice to think, I mean,
a lot of people think, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant, it's here, it's on Earth,
it's for us, it's to cure us, it's to heal
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants aren't actually here so we can
eat them predominantly because of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, a lot of these are defense
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not they're not bred in such a
way that that if we that they were so
[SPEAKER_01]: magic that they would just be gone,
at least historically now, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow them and breed them for
recreational use or medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that we'll be able to
just say, oh, this is the perfect plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will stay at that perfect ratio,
I think, to your point of saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, let's have multiple different
extracts and blend them to a ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: active components that we know help at
this ratio is probably a much better
[SPEAKER_01]: approach than just saying, you know,
some arbitrary named cannabis cultivar is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best for treating this disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and unfortunately, I think we've seen
this in dispensaries in many cases where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grandma goes in and she said,
Oh, you know, I've got pain, which should
[SPEAKER_01]: I use and somebody gives her, you know,
AK 47 or, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not, they didn't tell her about
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't tell her about ratio or,
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a bad experience and her thoughts
is, I've tried medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't work, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me sick, you know,
or, you know, they take somebody says,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, CBD is good for it may help
my epilepsy and they take 25 milligram
[SPEAKER_01]: gummy, and it doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh, I've tried CBD for
seizures and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're kind of on the right
track and more on the scientific track and
[SPEAKER_01]: the others are kind of more on the
branding and kind of optimistic idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: something magical is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to finish off this set with a
conversation that, you know, I know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really well versed in and I spend a lot of
time thinking about and because I keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: open mind about it, my opinion has
definitely changed over the last decade of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with cannabis medicine and it is
the idea of a whole plant medicine versus
[SPEAKER_00]: using isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and this is, this is how I want to,
I'm going to set you up is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because, because, you know,
Dr. Ethan Russo has been my mentor from
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning and he is historically,
you know, I dare say ferociously whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I learned that from
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and for those who aren't
familiar, whole plant means that you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're, you're using a method to
extract all of the resin from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you are, you know, taking that
resin orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, nowadays when there
are so many more labs and people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, separating the resin from
the plant and then continuing to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: the single molecules of say CBD or CBG
from the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then either, you know,
selling that as a, as a, as a powder or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, you know, that powder and putting
into a gummy or, or, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then at the, at the extreme,
what is going to become much more common
[SPEAKER_00]: is pharmaceutical products where different
components of the resin are isolated and
[SPEAKER_00]: then combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've, I've gone so far when
I've, when I've been talking at
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions to call this like,
you know, Frankenstein built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like preparations and, and, you know,
I, I'm not quite that hot about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it as much as I used to be,
but there, but we do know that isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: acts different than a whole plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it, you know, there's a,
there's a plateau point where,
[SPEAKER_00]: where more doesn't help anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and many believe that it acts
differently because it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: working in a synergistic way with the rest
of the novel and minor cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there is absolutely good use for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one for me that I had to come
around to and embrace isolate was when CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: became popular, but before the CBD plants
were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so people were like,
we want to take CBD in our, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil, but there's no CBD in the
plants that we have near us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we decided to start,
you know, spiking a type one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a THC plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we started, you know, like,
like talking about spiking those
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations with a CBD isolate because
CBD isolate was available before CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were in a lot of places,
let alone CBD plants that don't have THC
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to mess with your ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I, I, I first went to
Ethan about it and he's all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, until you can get the plant,
you know, you can spike with, with a
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we talked to Dr. Sunil
Agarwal and he's all like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, until you, well, well,
damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that suddenly I was, I was
interested in isolate and recommending it
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that patients use it for this
particular purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that big setup, I know that,
you know, you and I have discussed the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge between balancing the kind of,
you know, ideal nature won't hurt me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature can heal me kind of like beauty,
you know, ideal plant medicine head space
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really grasp onto with,
with the more, more realistic idea or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or differently realistic idea that good
cannabis medicine is the same every time
[SPEAKER_00]: gives repeatable results and hits the
goals of the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I gotta say that there's so
many variables in, in making your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine that, that very often we
won't hit those goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, so, you know, breaking it apart
and putting it back together by hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pharmaceutical company would,
or like you have to do in the lab for your
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense as far as
control goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it also makes me cringe because I
really do think there is some kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown X variable of healing that comes
with a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I know that this is also probably
another topic that you could do a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: show on honor, but, but, but I know
there's a lot of people out there who are
[SPEAKER_00]: making their own medicine, who really chew
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'd like to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it could be a long
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of components.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I would say that if you're looking
at isolated compounds, quite frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be careful about what the
excipient components are in those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this kind of goes without
saying for most of your audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you, when you're making an
isolate and this isn't the case with every
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate maker, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to, are you going to just,
are you going to define what an excipient
[SPEAKER_00]: is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, I'm going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in excipient, I'll just go,
go for it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the excipient is the component that is
not what is in that particular ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an excipient like adulterates in the
isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could call them adulterants,
but they're used specifically for the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and crystallization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one method of crystallization to make
it into a white powder out of a resin is
[SPEAKER_01]: to add things like heptane or pentane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, and you can clean those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But depending on who's making it,
you could have some of these nasty
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, it's not the isolate that
would necessarily be the problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could be the provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if people are using those,
it would be important to get a COA that
[SPEAKER_01]: shows things like metals and everything
else, but also what solvents are present
[SPEAKER_01]: in that isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, if there
aren't regulations in place to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff's clean, that taking solvents
over and over again, like napthala or
[SPEAKER_01]: paint thinner or butane, residual butane,
could be problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to keep in mind when
you're using those compounds to fortify
[SPEAKER_01]: existing formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing just to point out on the
isolates versus the non isolates is I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there are certain conditions where,
you know, to get the entourage or this
[SPEAKER_01]: rational polypharmacy kind of effect may
not be needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an example would be in some cases of
pediatric epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the jury's out on how much
THC is good or bad for children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm of the group that would say,
until we know if we can avoid it and get
[SPEAKER_01]: the result we want, that may be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot more safety data on
CBD for kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can give a child CBD in an
isolated form and them be seizure free and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have side effects, then I don't see a
good reason to say, let's add a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff in there if they're already,
basically if the treatment is successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that doesn't happen all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is quite infrequent that that
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you'll need to balance,
you know, this whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can these other cannabinoids play a
critical role to reducing seizures or help
[SPEAKER_01]: treat disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are those components?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be that fortifying existing
whole plant extracts with other isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds is the best way to get what you
call Frankenstein medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say maybe optimized
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be the only way to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably very similar to the argument
you just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of us who really idealize
whole plant medicine, would you make the
[SPEAKER_00]: case to me as a whole plant medicine
aficionado on why I should be open to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of formulations that are presently
happening at pharmaceutical companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mean isolated compounds or whole
plant compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can take Epidiolex or Sativex or
any of these where they have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple components of cannabis resin and
then they have put together those
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the entire melange of resin,
but they have taken the parts that they
[SPEAKER_00]: think are most essential to getting the
desired results for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not whole plant, but there are
reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as somebody who, like you have a foot
in both camps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You believe in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, who is still resistant to
pharmaceutical preparations, I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear what you would say to somebody
like me so that all of us who think like
[SPEAKER_00]: me can learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, well, Sativex is a whole
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally an extract of two different
cultivars of cannabis and blended
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have an idealic ratio, or at least
what they thought was an idealistic ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: when they invented it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other components, the excipients,
so what that cannabis is in, isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily the same as what is commonly
available in dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use other kind of pharmaceutical
components that may or may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: important, so to speak, for delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Epidiolex is CBD isolate and sesame
oil with strawberry flavoring and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of ethanol to dissolve that strawberry
flavoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's primarily done so these kids
that are very sick and off of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: often they have like autistic like
features or not all of them, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: but oftentimes that's what happens in
these cognitively delayed children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't taste good, then they're
not gonna take it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in these instances,
having a pharmaceutical that is prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: by a physician that's covered by insurance
that works is a great step in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the doses that you need for
CBD to control seizures are usually quite
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the hundreds to even thousands of
milligrams needed to control seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a patient, it's almost like
dangling a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, hey, we have this treatment,
it may help you or it may help your child,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're gonna have to spend $100 a day
or $50 a day to buy it off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it becomes unattainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a system whether it's whole
plant, a whole plant extract that goes and
[SPEAKER_01]: meets FDA requirements for being the same
thing standardized that's proven to work
[SPEAKER_01]: in a disease accepted by physicians and
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether you're from the deep south and
think cannabis is evil or whether you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis connoisseur where you're like,
hey, we've got data at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works and it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's covered by payers and insurance
is a really good situation for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: until we fix all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be for an isolate or it
could be for a whole plant extract that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just know is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we've proven it works,
it gets reimbursed from insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good way to ground
that argument, Hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in the end, what is our end goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our end goal is not whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our end goal is to reduce the suffering of
our fellow humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can get there in a way that is
safe for their physical body and also
[SPEAKER_00]: relieves their symptoms, whether or not
it's whole plant or it's whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: spiked with isolate or it is a
pharmaceutical blend that was put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, they're all hopefully getting us to
the goal, which is to reduce suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just, your audience,
most of your audience, I would expect that
[SPEAKER_01]: most of you guys out there listening are
not anti cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people that are completely
anti cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are people that are maybe on the
fence, but they're just not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, you know, and a lot of
doctors are not going to prescribe grandma
[SPEAKER_01]: or grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, purple Kush or, you know,
name any one of these these different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars of cannabis, they're just not
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to help that subset of
people, whether they're right or wrong in
[SPEAKER_01]: their opinions, having a cannabis extract,
a whole plant medicine or an isolate that
[SPEAKER_01]: can help reduce their suffering that would
be prescribed by a physician has a much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher chance of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then trying to convince them to talk to
their budtender or grow their own cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and make their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's not going to happen for
some folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this this set has gone a little
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go ahead and take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we come back, we're going to
have a nice short set where we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a couple of the things to be careful
for when taking cannabis to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity and health span.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guest today is neuroscientist
Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about the award
winning cannabis seeds that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical breeding program of Seth and
Eric Crawford, who founded Oregon CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Seth was a guest on shaping fire
in 2020 to talk about triploid genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric are now releasing high THC
seeds for home growers and farms as grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the revolution seeds at GTR seeds dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their high THC seeds are extraordinary in
that they will start to flower at 16 and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours of daylight instead of the
typical 14 and a half hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means in most regions, your plants
will start to flower outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of July instead of the middle of
August, which means these photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: plants finish in September and not
October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally upending the photo period seed
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric took their prized early
flowering CBG line and bred it to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most desired verified genetics out
there, including Sour Diesel, Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Wedding Cake, Chem Dogs,
Skittles and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crosses all express powerful photo
period terpene profiles and THC giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: a great high.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds has a new THCV line with plants
like Double Durbin and Gigantor that boast
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one THC to THCV and people want
that THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTR seeds are very consistent,
true growing inbred F1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seeds are nearly homogenous and the
plants should all grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one phenotype in every pack
available as diploids and triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seth and Eric's company is still family
owned, patient and employee centric and
[SPEAKER_00]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can purchase these seeds and the
entire catalog of Oregon CBD seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: gtrseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to gtrseeds.com today and choose
something revolutionary for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor or outdoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the topics I wanna share with
you are far too brief for an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping fire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those instances, I post them to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to follow my two Instagram
profiles and participate online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shaping fire Instagram has followup
posts to shaping fire episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and processing best practices,
product trials and of course, gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shango Lose Instagram follows my
travels on cannabis garden tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: my successes and failures in my own
garden, insights and best practices from
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grows everywhere and always
gorgeous flower photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both profiles, the emphasis is on
sharing what I've learned in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can replicate it in your own garden,
your own hash lab or for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinopathic health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to follow at
shapingfire.com and at Shango Lose and
[SPEAKER_00]: join our online community on Instagram.

[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of
cannabis medicine around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Vlosky and Josh Rutherford on
solventless extraction and Jeff Lowenfels
[SPEAKER_00]: on the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several presentations from Dr.
Ethan Russo on terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, be sure to check out the
three 10-part shaping fire session series,
[SPEAKER_00]: one with Kevin Jodry, one with Dr. Ethan
Russo and one with Jeff Lowenfels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even my own presentations on how to
approach finding your dream job in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and why we choose cannabis
business even though the risks are so
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, there's over 200 videos that
you can check out for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to youtube.com forward slash Shango
Lose or click on the link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: with Josh Rutherford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are listening to shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Shango Lose, and my guest
today is neuroscientist, Hunter Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are with the big finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hunter, I wanted to talk about a
couple of things that folks should be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful of when designing their
supplementation regime to increase their
[SPEAKER_00]: lifelong wellness and health span because
people do put other things in their body
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing in the body, you know,
exists in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we recently did a full
length show with Jehan Marku about
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between cannabis and other
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it deserves to be brought up
here as well, since we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wellness and people,
you know, developing a supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: routine that they use every day because
there is a very, you know, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, maybe even likely that there
will be interactions between the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen that they come up with for
themselves and other things that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like you to speak to the
idea of cannabis, you know, drug-drug
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction so people can understand the
lay of the land as they are thinking this
[SPEAKER_00]: through on how they're going to proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like listeners to keep in mind that,
you know, the reason that we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymes in our liver and we have our
liver to process compounds that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to, and many of those are plant
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that these enzymes work is
when they're exposed to the compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: it breaks it down to something not active
or usually inactive that's easily excreted
[SPEAKER_01]: by the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of overlap on what each
enzyme breaks down, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine or a drug, a plant, a nutritional
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The body doesn't know whether it's
artificial or if it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it sees something that it needs
to get out of the body, or at least it
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks, and I'm personalizing the liver
now, which is a little bit odd for a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it doesn't really, you don't really
see this distinction between natural and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic as far as the liver's concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just knows it needs to excrete these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem comes when you only have X
amount of enzyme to break down one drug or
[SPEAKER_01]: one compound, and you also need that
enzyme to break down another compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one example of where you can
get elevations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this a lot with CBD,
especially at higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, there's a drug called
clopazam that's commonly prescribed in LGS
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dravet, two pediatric really sad forms
of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is if you take CBD in
conjunction with clopazam, both the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: clopazam goes up, as well as the active
metabolite, seven hydroxy CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When clopazam goes up, it causes sedation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw this in clinical trials,
and the patients need to reduce,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes reduce either CBD or clopazam
after the trial and clinical practice to
[SPEAKER_01]: limit this potential drug-drug
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also potential interactions around
bleeds for things like warfarin,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a commonly prescribed drug for
people with clotting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That needs to reduce clotting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably the most concerning thing
that we saw in all the CBD research is
[SPEAKER_01]: risk for liver toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really see any per se liver
toxicity, but we did see indicators in
[SPEAKER_01]: blood work that said, hey, this might not
be good for the liver at this dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was commonly in really high
doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also common when they were
taking another drug called Depakote,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a known liver toxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the ones we know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably five to 10 other drugs
that may have this interaction with CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: where it may not be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing can be said for some of
these supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of supplements that combine
a lot of different plant components,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of these can be enzyme
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inhibiting the components that break
down the drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they can also induce them, basically
tell your body, oh, we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, so we're going to increase these
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not going to get the
quality or the amount of exposure needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat your disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these can be a tough little balancing
act if you're doing it on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always good to consult with a
pharmacist or a physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: About these potential drug-drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for considering the state of the
technology and everything right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the common person, probably the place
to start would be to Google your
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical that you're taking and the
word cannabis and start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's pretty much going to be
your entry to any of this kind of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then follow up with whatever studies
you come across, if there are any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be one way you could
definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, cannabis, if you look up,
if you've got just a little bit of CBD in
[SPEAKER_01]: your cannabis, that's probably not going
to be the same as if you're taking,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you mentioned, a high CBD chemivore
of hemp.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So dose is definitely a critical component
to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a reasonable place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing would be, pharmacists
actually are pretty knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this area and the other type of
drug-drug interaction that we see is
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacodynamic interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is like, how does it,
it might not be the molecules themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting, but it may be that kind of
like you're having the entourage effect to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have a entourage effect for
inebriation or sleep or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like if you take, if you drink
alcohol with cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not necessarily interacting
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they may have a pharmacodynamic
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like then if you didn't want to drive the
car with your X amount of drinks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might definitely not want to drive the
car with that plus cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens with other medications
too, like commonly prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants or a lot of these drugs
that are mood stabilizers and things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might get these other interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with THC, the pharmacodynamic
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more safety question and then
we'll wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been talking about a lot
of different dosages and some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are developing their own
regimen, is there a too high a dose that
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, as many people have said,
it's like, oh, even water can kill you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you take enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know that there's like a maximum
for pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, how, you know, how can,
how can somebody who's formulating for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time think about the, how much is
too much question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think, you know, we've seen,
I mean, cannabis generally is pretty safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you also see cannabis hyper emesis
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so some individuals just end up for
whatever reason over time, not being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to tolerate THC very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that component that it could
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is safe at the beginning may not be
safe months or years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, you know, I think it would
be a reasonable idea if you're taking CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in hundreds of milligrams types
doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at your kind of standard liver
panel, your standard liver enzymes as part
[SPEAKER_01]: of your physical exam, I think could be
important because you can always see these
[SPEAKER_01]: elevations or maybe you already have these
elevations and then piling CBD on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, maybe, maybe a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think it's, it's, um,
it would be in everyone's best interest to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of monitor these things just for
peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and if, and if folks are new to
this idea of, uh, cannabis hyper eminence,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, cannabinoid hyper eminence,
emesis syndrome, um, uh, we did an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, uh, 80 on it with Dr. Ethan
Russo, whose name has come up a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and, and, and he's great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, you know, he's researched so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you can't really talk about,
you know, cannabinopathic medicine without
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping over a bunch of his research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, so yeah, so episode 80,
if you're new to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hundreds to, to, to bring us to the
close here, you know, we've, we've,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have talked about cannabinopathic
medicine today in terms of, of longevity
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and not only the length of life,
but also the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and instead of like, you know,
often we think about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid medicine as, oh, this is
broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I fix the broke thing in me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas when we're talking about life,
lifelong wellness, it's, it's more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the keeping the system going and
rebalancing itself and rejuvenating
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping those systems functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to, to bring us home, what do you see
as the, um, you know, the novel
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or the research that you are
seeing evolve right now that hold a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: promise for longevity with, uh,
cannabis medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I think it's a really
interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an acute interest in both,
uh, botanical drug substances that combine
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or include multiple different
cannabinoids to, to, whether we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say entourage or, uh, additive,
super additive effects or rational
[SPEAKER_01]: polypharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of ways to, to term it,
but go to, to treat disease, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: in combination by multiple different
methods or mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a really big interest in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that relates directly with age
related disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in preventative medicine,
um, and maybe once you've passed
[SPEAKER_01]: preventative medicine, maybe we can,
we can stabilize those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is these, what I would
consider more novel cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are understudied, like the,
the acids, the, the cannabinoid acids
[SPEAKER_01]: before they're heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, some of these other cannabinoids
like CBC and CBE and a lot of these really
[SPEAKER_01]: understudied, uh, cannabinoids that we
just don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know they're active.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't know where to use them and
how to use them and how much we should
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I think I've got a lot more work
ahead of me as well as, as many other,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cannabiners, so to speak, uh,
in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, Hunter, thank you so much for
spending your time with us and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bringing your unique experience that
has, you know, um, you know, your ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to do complex research in the lab,
but then the other ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak about it and to lay folks like us so
that we can better understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the cannabis medicine that,
you know, so many of us rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you so much for sharing your
very valuable time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, thanks so much for having me.
