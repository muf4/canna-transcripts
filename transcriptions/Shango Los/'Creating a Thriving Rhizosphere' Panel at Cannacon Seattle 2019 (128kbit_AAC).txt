[SPEAKER_04]: Hey there, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the 130 Soil Science panel
called Creating a Thriving Rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is for all you soil nerds in the
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Shango Los, moderator for the panel
and host of the Shaving Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoy learning from the top minds
in the cannabis business industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to visit ShavingFire.com
to enjoy in-depth interviews on cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: business, health, and technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will provide you with actionable
information and not waste your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, our YouTube channel serves over a
half a million minutes of exclusive
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis content a month that I've
gathered from conferences just like this
[SPEAKER_04]: one and from traveling the country to
visit industry experts.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, if you dig the panel
today, it will be on the Shaving Fire
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube channel next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other recent guests have included
cultivator Kevin Jodrie, the godfather of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis terpenes neurologist Dr. Ethan
Russo, geneticist Dr. Reggie Gaudino on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant patents, and Colin Bell and
Tav Hussey from our panel today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Natasha Riz on using the cannabis root
ball as medicine and many, many other
[SPEAKER_04]: folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've got your mobile phone with
you and we know you do, please take a
[SPEAKER_04]: moment and put it on vibrate so we don't
have to hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately to my right is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colin Bell is the co-founder of Mammoth
Microbes and co-inventor of their flagship
[SPEAKER_04]: product Mammoth P. He received his PhD in
biological sciences specializing in soil
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial ecology and plant microbe
interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: To his right is Dr. Jade Stefano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jade Stefano is co-founder and CEO of
Puffin Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: She earned her biology degree at Reed
College in a doctorate in naturopathic
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine from Bastyr University in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to her right is Tav Hussey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tav Hussey is owner of KIS Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He earned a master's from Macquarie
University Australia in 2005, but received
[SPEAKER_04]: the bulk of his soil education in the
family business over in Redmond,
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tav manages the research and microscope
testing for KIS Organics and teaches soil
[SPEAKER_04]: and body courses at the KIS Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the co-founder of logicalgarter.org,
a free science-based horticulture forum
[SPEAKER_04]: that has formulated soils, nutrients,
and other products over the past decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tav is also the host of the cannabis
cultivation and soil science podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a soil nerd and you haven't
checked out Tav's podcast, I highly
[SPEAKER_04]: recommend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes deep into vocabulary that loses
people, which is usually a good sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today we're going to be talking about
creating a thriving rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for people who may be new to soil
science, that's the area that lives all
[SPEAKER_04]: around the root structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the neighborhood of the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be talking about the
life that happens below the soil near the
[SPEAKER_04]: root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start with a question
for Colin first, and then Jade and Tav
[SPEAKER_04]: will take a turn with the question as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Colin, for a generation, most cannabis
growers have simply followed directions on
[SPEAKER_04]: the back of bottled nutrients and hoped
everything was okay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, though, we understand that having a
thriving rhizosphere is essential to great
[SPEAKER_04]: tasting terpene profiles and sustainable
results for business.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it mean to you to have a
thriving rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are some of the outcomes you
would expect to see in the soil and from
[SPEAKER_04]: your cannabis crop when you actually do
create a thriving rhizosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks very much, Shango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, this has been a really fun
journey because I am approaching cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation from my academic or
fundamental science background,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was a soil microbial ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for years and years, my studies and my
publications focused on understanding how
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes interact with plants to support
plant health, plant development in natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and in agriculture systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when thinking about how to apply
microbes or what I think about rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: health in more precision agriculture
indoor practices, it all relates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizosphere is the root zone and
microbes thrive in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a really significant
interaction that occurs where plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the microbes from the carbon they
assimilate through the air and score it in
[SPEAKER_00]: as simple sugars to stimulate the
microbial community or rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that because they get an exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a density and the right
diversity of microbes, when plants do in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere, they get exchanges with
nutrient uptake, with protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere from other potential
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think we see data-driven when
we add more biology into what might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively sterile, stult environment,
we see the plants respond by increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: their yield and increasing their quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I attribute that mostly to the not
only increased absorption potential that
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can take nutrients up that might
not be available through those microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions and assert them or allocate
them towards more yield and towards more
[SPEAKER_00]: quality metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some nutrients and micronutrients
become limiting very quick because of
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption capacity within the rhizosphere
or substrate zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbes, as they do in nature,
will liberate those micronutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: allow plants to take them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those micronutrients in particular act as
cavities or as cofactors to allow plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize their physiology, which allows
plants to increase yield significantly and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see in our studies, and I'll end
it there, is when we engage with
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial farmers and on our trial farm,
we have cannabis and high CBD cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farms in Colorado, strictly for R&D
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we see increases in the yield,
but we see significant increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: different terpene profiles and different
cannabinoid profiles, which strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to the plant-microbe interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different microbes will help plants in
different ways take up those resources to
[SPEAKER_00]: allocate towards those qualities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, thanks Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jade, what do you look for to know in
your soil or in your crop that the
[SPEAKER_04]: rhizosphere is helpful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when we first started growing
indoors in the early 90s, we tried all
[SPEAKER_02]: different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew in pots, we grew hydroponically,
we used soil, chemical fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: organic fertilizers, fish emulsions,
all types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the end of this journey, we started
growing in the 90s and we were doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: through the early 2000s, we at some point
realized that cannabis grown in soil
[SPEAKER_02]: always tastes better.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point we didn't really have the
science to tell us why, but it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: visible through experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started growing exclusively in soil
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that all the science is coming out,
we know that there is this microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: community that is making nutrients
available and letting the plants get
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal health so they do express better
terpene and cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just really interesting because I
think people have known for years that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil cannabis tasted better and they just
didn't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now we have the evidence,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we started growing in 502,
we decided to grow outdoors in a living
[SPEAKER_02]: farm in the soil that is native to the
earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had to amend the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a old hay farm that had been
cultivated intensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not use fertilizers or
pesticides, it was just hay, hay,
[SPEAKER_02]: hay, year after year sucking the life out
of the sandy loam soil that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: blessed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the time we got it, it was a
really good base of sandy loam,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it had been stripped of a lot of
organic matter and the microbial community
[SPEAKER_02]: was not so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had been working over the last
five years to rebuild that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's been, every year we see an
improvement in the soil and it's been a
[SPEAKER_02]: really pristine journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely soil is always,
it provides the medium for microbes and
[SPEAKER_02]: then adding things to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have added a lot of biochar,
which is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a permanent amendment being put in
the soil and it will be there for a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand years or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be there forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inorganic carbon so it doesn't break
down the way organic carbon does and it
[SPEAKER_02]: provides habitat for all these microbial
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these that we're talking about,
so as far as an actionable item in
[SPEAKER_02]: building farm soil, biochar is our
absolute favorite, one of our favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys touched on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to what Colin hit on a little
bit around nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a layman's perspective, this idea
when we're adding organic nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, what we're really doing is we're
feeding all of these microbial communities
[SPEAKER_05]: in the rhizosphere with events.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're recycling the nutrients and making
them plant available.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we have fish meal or alfalfa meal,
we're not directly feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, I think really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we're finding even from working
with like giant pumpkin growers,
[SPEAKER_05]: for instance, they sort of peaked out from
seed to fruit around a thousand pounds,
[SPEAKER_05]: 1200 pounds, which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But since they started reincorporating
back in biological things like mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_05]: fungus and various organic amendments and
taking more care with the compost and
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at the biology, they were able to
up the yields, you know, and through
[SPEAKER_05]: improved genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're up in I think 23, 2400 pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of, there's definitely a
synergy going on in the rhizosphere that I
[SPEAKER_05]: think is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jay touched on biochar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as someone who has worked with some
different biochar producers, I just want
[SPEAKER_05]: to comment that not all biochar is the
same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really important to know what
you're purchasing and what you're applying
[SPEAKER_05]: because biochar is sort of this catchall
term.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you get high quality biochar,
I would say we're seeing about eight to
[SPEAKER_05]: nine percent better growth and yield just
with the addition of biochar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Tad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for today, we're going to start with
Jay and then go to Tad and then Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Sopano, at commercial scale,
producers are working with large volumes
[SPEAKER_04]: of soil and they often need more scalable
solutions than we use as home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may be using local soils or importing
soils to grow in large bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, these soils may not be in the
best condition for growing by their
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you suggest for commercial scale
growers to invigorate and revitalize the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil they're beginning to put to work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that's kind of what our situation
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover crops are a really great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that there's all
different types of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen fixing ones are especially
beneficial to reinvigorate the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out roots that help the texture
of the soil and break up compact soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also fix nitrogen from the atmosphere
and release that into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they die, they are turned into
additional organic material and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plants can feed off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a long-term solution is using cover
crops in your aisles and then in between
[SPEAKER_02]: plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So off season in the fall, we plant a
cover crop and that will keep growing into
[SPEAKER_02]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it may or may not be tilled in,
depending on whether you're doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till or a till scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things that we really like that are
economical at scale are alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cheap input material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got compounds in it that microbes
absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has some nitrogen that's not very
strong, but it adds a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and provides great substrate for
the microbes to feed on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that it's a little
bit more difficult at scale because they
[SPEAKER_02]: can be quite extensive, but there are some
sources for affordable worm castings in
[SPEAKER_02]: bulk and you don't need as much as you
would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even at relatively low
concentrations, worm castings provide
[SPEAKER_02]: really great microbial activity,
organic matter, phosphorus, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's another one we love.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: We put in a lot of rock dust and that's
another cheap amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of soils are lacking micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So putting in rock powders from different
sources can provide a wide spectrum of
[SPEAKER_02]: base micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those you need to handle very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are an inhalation hazard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when those are being used,
proper precautions need to be taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mulching is a really great thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be done with the cover crops
that you grow and then you can just mow
[SPEAKER_02]: those down right under the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do not weed our farm anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pretty much mulch the weeds and cut
them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put a lot of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like choose your weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we choose alfalfa and vetch,
not alfalfa, vetch and clovers and
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial insect-attracting plants like
calendula.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole bunch of them,
radishes, daikons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are grown around the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they start getting too big and
encroaching on the plants, they mow them
[SPEAKER_02]: down and they create a mulch right there
under the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that breaks down and keeps other weeds
from growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thinking you have to keep a bare
soil under your plants or use black
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic to prevent weeds is kind of a
little bit counterproductive in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty good answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they have a lot to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, I always suggest that
people, if we're talking about outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: farming, which seems to be the focus of
this particular question, then I always
[SPEAKER_05]: suggest get to know your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find out what cover crops they're using on
their field because a lot of times they've
[SPEAKER_05]: done that research for you and they have
that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bringing in an outside consultant like
myself to come in and tell you what cover
[SPEAKER_05]: crop to run is not always the best idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll know about the type of water and
how your water may change over the course
[SPEAKER_05]: of the season, too, which is really
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also find out what you can source
locally.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many great amendments probably
in your area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know like in Ellensburg, there's
probably a lot of cow manure available.
[SPEAKER_05]: But finding things that are locally
sourced is a really great option.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, evaluating the quality of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So work castings made from cow manure are
going to be a very different quality than
[SPEAKER_05]: work castings made from horse manure or
green waste or other sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's important to do a little more
research on all this stuff and really know
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're putting on your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a lot of good local
resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing I want to mention
is on our farm, which is a vegetable farm,
[SPEAKER_05]: we use a lot of arborist chips.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get them for free.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a place to dump the chips.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we get deciduous chips,
we take those and we save those for
[SPEAKER_05]: composting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all the hardwood chips that we
get, we use for pathways around the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that does a great job when we need
suppression, when we really know what we
[SPEAKER_05]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, everything's been covered pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of overview my
perspective of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start with the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon is the currency of all life on
Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the currency which provides the
substrate and the fertility for plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is a habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the pool of nutrients that plants
need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only element that plants get outside
of soil is carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fix that from the air,
from CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other nutrient they get from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about soil as a habitat
and a pool of nutrients that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: for your plants to grow, that's the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about carbon as a
currency of all life, that is the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the carbon creates the habitat and
the binding capacity and the fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity for your soil to hold nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also creates the habitat for the
microbes in that soil to cycle the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients reflecting on what was shared in
these past conversations to deliver those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so scaling carbon as we get to bigger
farms is probably the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's costs and trade-offs
associated with all those practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as farms get larger, the cover
crops become much more scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the plan at the end of the
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to say this in academia from a
microbiology lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are charismatic carbon pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plant themselves in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take carbon from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they suck it right down through the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover crops, if you can have seed and
use cover crops effectively, you add
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon and habitat into your soils,
which improves soil fertility and the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be delivered back up to your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I'm going to add, too,
as far as cover crops go, is if you think
[SPEAKER_04]: about it, one of the things that makes the
Amazon so alive is that the canopy is
[SPEAKER_04]: holding the moisture in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we find from cover crops,
too, is because you've got this small area
[SPEAKER_04]: below the cover crop where you've got an
Amazonian type canopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the top of your soil is kept moist,
all of the microbes and worms and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: other life can do their thing closer to
the top of the soil where more of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis roots are located.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so another advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we move on to the third
question, I'm going to come back to you,
[SPEAKER_04]: Tad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I heard you answer this
question before, we usually get your plug
[SPEAKER_04]: for soil testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would like you to hit on the
importance of soil testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, Jayden, Colin, if you want to
add on anything on soil testing,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But get that plug in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about any soil or any
nutrient program or any even microbial
[SPEAKER_05]: addition, what we have to look at is
really we have to know what's already in
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what we're trying to figure out is
what the limiting factor of growth is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's a nutrient, that's something
we need to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: But randomly adding a nutrient really
doesn't solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can actually compound or create
even more problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really about balance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's sort of my pitch for soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another tool that you can use as
a gardener, just like a rake or a shovel
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything else, to really know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really, I think, the foundation
that we want to build off of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we talk about microbial
additions, what we're doing there is we're
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially unlocking or making those
nutrients more available to plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you sort of have two aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the test itself, which is going
to tell you what you need to add in terms
[SPEAKER_05]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the microbes,
which are going to give you the ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle those nutrients into a form of
organic uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do either of you want to take a vote on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think growing or cultivating
or farming with data-driven decisions is
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variability happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms, cultivation, cannabis farms,
alike, are dynamic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to inform that change with
some form of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start with the baseline of
understanding what we're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned, our substrate in the pot,
our substrate has soil in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: has an inherent soil nutrient-holding
capacity, which is going to change as your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In natural systems, those nutrients are
recycled back down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's detritus when some plants and the
leaves fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a natural cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In managed farms, in annual managed farms,
often there's more nutrients leaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil than returning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know what nutrient baseline you
have at the beginning of every season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be very efficient and informed
with what you put back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really critical step
that general agriculture ought to say is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know from years of research in
agriculture sciences that more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are put in than are ever taken up by
plants and nutrient buildups happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have pretty good ecological
pollution in waterways, in buildup of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and nitrogen pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those excessive chemicals,
fertilizers that are added to the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete or decrease microbial
biodiversity, which decrease soil
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so balancing out your nutrient inputs
actually nurtures the potential of the
[SPEAKER_00]: life, the biology in your soil to persist
and balance out the nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_00]: potential so your plants can grow as
naturally as possible in soils without
[SPEAKER_00]: having to amend a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing your microbial presence,
the biodiversity and the CFUs or the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, along with those nutrient
tests, allow you to have a baseline that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can follow over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farming, broad-scale farming, is about
predictable variability so you can be as
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a crop in, you want to have a
predictable outcome year after year
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can manage predictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes all the way down to
understanding the substrate of the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane, do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's all good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't overemphasize how important
soil testing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We test every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've actually seen our organic matter
wrinkle up was 1% when we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now at 5% or 6%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even if we use a low-till system,
even with tilling, we see an increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're putting back a lot of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we add nutrients,
we buy only what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the soil test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for some micro and macronutrients,
and especially micronutrients like the
[SPEAKER_02]: limes and whatnot, some years we might
need to add dolomite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other years, we may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, our soil doesn't need
dolomite.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of natural magnesium in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But different types of limes and just the
basic amounts of the essential nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can calculate that and add fixed
amounts and do that consistently every
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're not adding too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not adding too little.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's adding stuff with a good reason
and with science and a really important
[SPEAKER_02]: tester soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a little bit of an aside.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like soil gets a bad rap in a
lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people, whenever they see a
deficiency in a plant, they just assume
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a nutrient deficiency caused by the
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially for indoor growers,
you really have to look at your lighting,
[SPEAKER_05]: the quality of the lighting, the intensity
of the lighting, your CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_05]: your temperature and humidity
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hydrology, the way you're watering
has a massive impact on nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: availability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't just assume that your nutrient
deficiency means you need to add calmeg or
[SPEAKER_05]: add something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would encourage people to look at a
picture holistically.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get phone calls and people tell me,
they send me a photo and say, fix this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no way I could.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one could.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to know the whole picture
to really understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really all I wanted to add on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't put your microphone down
because you're starting this next
[SPEAKER_04]: question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is going to be our third and
final question.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our final question before we go to
your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think you're going to add a
question, that would be the time to
[SPEAKER_04]: determine what it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one we're going to start with you,
Tad, and then we'll go to Colin,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Jay will finish us up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tad, the cannabis plant rhizosphere is
an ever-changing place that has abundances
[SPEAKER_04]: and deficiencies over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than soil testing, which we've
already covered, for commercial farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: who need reliable and consistent results,
how do you suggest the soil be managed
[SPEAKER_04]: over the scope of years to remain potent
and abundant and not get depleted season
[SPEAKER_04]: after season?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I really like Colin's answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Realizing that in these commercial
systems, every time we harvest a plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're pulling out nutrients and we're
pulling out organic matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things need to be replaced every
cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so by getting data points on that
through soil testing, we're able to better
[SPEAKER_05]: manage, over time, our soil fertility and
by improving our soil fertility,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Jay's been able to do, raising that
organic matter 4% doesn't sound like a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot, but that's a huge improvement on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think every year, I'm guessing our
inputs are going down because of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So creating not only a better soil
fertility through mineral nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: management, but also through biological
management, that's where that organic
[SPEAKER_05]: matter and that carbon, creating that
habitat is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about it the same exact way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainable agriculture, is about giving
more than you take away and moderating
[SPEAKER_00]: your practices that accommodate that is
what I would encourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And year after year, if you have pretty
measurable or pretty consistent routines
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as how you're amending soil and you
collect the data on the responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: the results of those practices,
you can slightly alter and tweak your
[SPEAKER_00]: practices to match consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent practices equal consistent
results or manageable results that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: alter slightly to keep that trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4%, a 1% increase in organic matter in
soils is a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 5% doesn't happen very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there's a real drive in
this farm to maximize carbon content,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a direct correlation with soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an amazing figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, both of them are saying that your
numbers are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you close us out of this
question with some actionable things that
[SPEAKER_04]: folks can do over the life of their farm
to start to match your numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we touched on some of these already
and cover crop management is enormous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably one of the fastest
ways to put carbon back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years, every year, you might get
one or two cycles of tilling in plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter that then add to that organic
material level in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I really like cover crops,
you can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really add too much compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible, but it would be very
expensive to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just putting in as much compost as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfalfa, haze, and mulch with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are pretty cheap and add lots of
carbon to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start treating your soil
well, stuff can turn around really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, our farm, it was hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were tilling it, just planting hay
seed and letting it grow and just cutting
[SPEAKER_02]: hay, cutting hay for years and years,
just sucking nutrients and carbon out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we started putting stuff back and
adding compost and biochar, it just turned
[SPEAKER_02]: around really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were seeing like a 1% a year
increase and it doesn't sound like a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're getting up into those ideal
5% organic matter levels right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it'll keep growing,
but we're pretty happy with where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you done?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't getting this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we go to question, let's do one
quick speed round question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one thing that I often hear after
a panel like this are people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't afford all these amendments
for the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the K&F is so hot right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the K&F ideals come from
using natural materials found in your
[SPEAKER_04]: local area, hopefully even on your own
farm, so you don't have to pay for it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 90 seconds or so, would you each hit
on that idea of using local inputs or free
[SPEAKER_04]: inputs so that you don't have to work at
all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with you, Chad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, K&F is a really popular
attempt for Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not an expert on it, but I've talked
to quite a few people that have
[SPEAKER_05]: experimented with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the idea of sourcing things on your
farm as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we do have to look at the fact
that not all nutrients are found on all
[SPEAKER_05]: farms is where we may need to bring in
inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are things that are there that
we can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, K&F is very similar to
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is something I'm a lot more familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: This idea of just creating sustainable
systems or healthy ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I personally like on our farm,
for example, we try to recycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we look at the best use for every
byproduct that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, with our leftover
vegetables and things that don't get sold,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they start to rot, those go to the
pigs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that pig manure then can be used
as a nutrient source for some of our
[SPEAKER_05]: plants down the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at completing the cycle
as much as possible with what we have
[SPEAKER_05]: available on the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, buying amendments year after year
gets quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's difficult for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've spent lots of money buying
amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to use local things is
very appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in our case, the extent that we've
done that, we've grown cover crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: turned those into compost, tilled those
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has gotten us a lot of bang for
our buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have animals on our farm,
which I regret.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another thing to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a cannabis farm in Washington,
there's so much hassle and regulation that
[SPEAKER_02]: just adding animals to that picture would
be unmanageable for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people that can have animals on
their farm, like he has pigs, I have
[SPEAKER_02]: friends who have chickens on their farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go around and they let the
chickens into the pot field and they poop
[SPEAKER_02]: and they put fertilizer in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they eat the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of things you can do
with animals or chickens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to do that someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about this as economies of scale
and adding carbon back into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to revisit this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think you can use cover crops
with precision and confidence if you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see very marked results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add a clover, which is a nitrogen
fixer, we're not only adding the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil, but you're actually fixing
nitrogen from the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing that into the soil also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see very different
results between a Timothy grass or an
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa or a clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you understand these cover crops
more, you can engineer the soil fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: based on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of physical properties,
the soil type, the water holding capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the climate that you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to have to tailor
those practices to your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use biochar in my home garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use it on my 65 acre hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can grow clover on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding how your field,
how your farm responds, what your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, you can really clearly identify the
stoichiometry or nutrient ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient expectations that different cover
crops can bring in to supplement the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health to meet the maximum productivity
that you would like for your cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors in particular is what we're
talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Helen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to open up to questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has got a question to get us started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that cover crop, we're an indoor
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're soil meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if I was to use cover crops,
because we have to amend our soil after
[SPEAKER_01]: our soil test every time, is it going to
be harder to amend that soil with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop on there to get it in the soil
correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to have a caveat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based on some experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all practices work for every
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on an indoor, I think that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's trade-offs with every decision
that we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to add that we need to make
sure we can measure that difference on a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I add clover and grow it over 65 acres,
I can really measure the difference over a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years in not only the carbon in
the soil, but potentially the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: levels as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cycling dynamic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over a couple of years, that's
measurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if an indoor pot system,
if it's measurable in one cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to have measurable results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to urge caution when
you're implementing something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: into your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had growers who tried to
implement clover as an example in their
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out to be a vector for pests
that made it harder for pest mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are trade-offs with every
decision we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your environment might not be as
suitable for a cover crop as an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other solutions where we want
to nurture the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to nurture the carbon holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in your case, and you know,
you guys use mammoth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding that life, you see good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe adding some more carbon,
you're going to see some good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you added clovers, maybe you're going
to see good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the clovers act as a vector to
bring in more pests, maybe that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: right solution as that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to work through every
scenario to find out what works best for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, and then experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to go ahead?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Collin brought up a really good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we have to remember with an
indoor environment is we don't have that
[SPEAKER_05]: same diversity of beneficial insects
naturally occurring like you would on an
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I do think cover crops are a lot
more challenging indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's one more crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have to manage fairly stringent
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's one more crop, you do have to
manage fairly stringent cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of in an urban carbon meaning,
it just has a lot of surface area and
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat, which will allow nutrients to
bind and microbes to create habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can conceptually get great value
from a lot of different biochar sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not consistent for your farm,
you're going to have inconsistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the big challenge in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be a whole talk in and of
itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll keep it really short.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're talking about biochar,
we're talking about pyrolyzed materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very, very high feed, very,
very low oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't do that, what you end up
with is charcoal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the quick tests that Renell
over at Black Owl Biochar, that's who
[SPEAKER_05]: we've worked with for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good relationship with her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said if you take your biochar and it
floats, then it's not high quality biochar
[SPEAKER_05]: because it doesn't have the high
absorption rates that you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a quick test.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you need to get all these test
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard of companies anecdotally
using all types of materials because wood
[SPEAKER_05]: sourcing is tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: With Black Owl, I know they're using
virgin forest slash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds horrible, I realize,
but it's actually a really good source
[SPEAKER_05]: because it needs to be dealt with where
it's a forest fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by taking it and making it into
biochar, they're able to sequester the
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there are good sources out there,
but you really have to do due diligence on
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have seen research that showed a
good biochar made from anything from
[SPEAKER_05]: chicken manure to woods and all these
different sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really about the consistency of
material and the quality of your inputs,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I call them into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to add to that,
one thing I have seen that is concerning,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people making biochar out of
waste wood from plywood and stuff that had
[SPEAKER_02]: adhesives and stuff in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something you would definitely
stay with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hear anything about using any waste
products from pre-processed wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: just keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing with biochar is
you can make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are all kinds of instructions on
the internet on how to build a reactor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's quite simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It involves a 50 gallon metal drum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can produce a lot of biochar that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people selling biochar sell it for
like $1,000 for like a tote for 500,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 pounds or 1,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a buck a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so adding any biochar, even if it's
not like, if you make it yourself and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not like the ideal condition biochar,
that's part of the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting carbon into your soil and
sequestering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can figure out how to make it
yourself, like that is a really great way
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I had a conversation with
somebody about making biochar,
[SPEAKER_04]: we all realized that the margins were
better than candidates right now in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy it anymore because I see the
price that people are selling it for is
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty alarming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely something that you
should try to make yourself if you feel at
[SPEAKER_02]: all crafty or capable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add really quick, do you want
to charge it as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking of like a giant sponge,
you need to fill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically just a small amount of
nitrogen is all you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in our soils, we added in a rate of 5%
to 8%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, not a very high rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very aggressive rate for an
agricultural soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs a lot less outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a small amount of nitrogen is what you
really want to get on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sell ours with fish hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can get a rate of like an ounce per
10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: People can even use compost teas and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you were to add it to straight
biochar on your soil, on your plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's actually going to be more efficient
than your plant in the long cases of
[SPEAKER_05]: taking up nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see your plant yellow and see
the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just be careful that we're uncharged
biochar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll suck the nutrients out of the
soil and put it in uncharged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be disappointed for at least a
season.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you all for being here for the
soil science presentation.
Thank you all.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
