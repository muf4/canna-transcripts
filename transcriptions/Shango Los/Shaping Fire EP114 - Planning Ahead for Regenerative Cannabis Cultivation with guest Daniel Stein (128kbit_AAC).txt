[SPEAKER_01]: We are passionate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't passionate, you probably
wouldn't be listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And passionate people get excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get excited, sometimes I want
to do all the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do everything at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to leave anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have all the experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that works out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life can be great like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often, it can be exhausting and
sometimes I screw stuff up because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do too much at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's episode is about how to build your
regeneratively minded cannabis farm with
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about building your soil without
blowing up the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about staying busy without going
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about building sustainable future
without being your own bully.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode 114.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guest today is Daniel Stein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel Stein was born in Humboldt County
and grew up in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to college first for engineering
and then for soils, forestry, and
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually environmental science.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started farming vegetables and cannabis
in Hawaii, doing lettuce farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture installations while
caretaking a citrus and avocado orchard in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jungle on land that was part of
Terrence McKenna's Ethno Botanical
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardens, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel returned to the home in Humboldt
where he was born and started gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: and farming in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010, he met his wife, Taylor,
and they became Briceland Forest Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started selling vegetables at farmers
markets in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2016, they entered the regulated
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, Briceland Forest Farm won the
regenerative cannabis farm award.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great year at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, they grow about three quarters
of an acre of vegetables, 5,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet of cannabis, and a small orchard and
perennial garden, all low or no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to use Daniel's parcel
as an example of how to approach growing
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneratively on your own new parcel or
transitioning from petroleum and salt
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers to regenerative growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lessons learned from his parcel can
likely be transferred to yours as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the first set, we'll talk about
assessing your property for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, building soil, and choosing
cover crops and companion plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the second set, we will discuss water
sequestration, animal husbandry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and animal fertilizers, and if crop
rotation applies to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finish the episode considering
controlled fire burns, long-term research
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities, and the economics of
growing cannabis regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Shaping Fire, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for giving us some of
your time on a busy midweek Tuesday during
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you have got to be totally
busy on the farm right now getting
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in place for the summer crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really nice to have the excuse
and opportunity to sit down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that you have set up outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the first time I've ever
had somebody set up outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, dear listener, can enjoy the birds
of Humboldt during the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that when you arrived on
your property, you knew you had a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: do to make your property into a functional
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the case with a lot of
new homesteaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the biggest concerns or projects
that you knew you needed to address first
[SPEAKER_01]: off in order to build out your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, on a homestead level,
the first thing was making sure I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the land level, the property had
been unmaintained for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of gardening, the first thing
I had to do is re-clear the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a forest environment,
and the forest had re-encroached a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: tree seedlings, Himalaya blackberry,
white thorn, various plants that had
[SPEAKER_00]: re-encroached on historic garden spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first order of business was to get
to clearing, some burning, some chipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I could borrow a chipper,
I had very little resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for cultivating cannabis,
which I was really excited to do here,
[SPEAKER_00]: was building a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back onto the property,
it was 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in the 215 days where it was
vague what the legality was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hid it in a greenhouse where
they couldn't see it and get a warrant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearing enough space, building a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I started to build out the
garden, as it was cleared, my next order
[SPEAKER_00]: of business was getting a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew what I was dealing with and knew
my approach to bringing that soil and that
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening space to a place where it was
productive again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hit on a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a big parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My farm is pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually more like a homestead with a
big garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that when it gets right down to
it, if I want to clear something and want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be, if I want it to stay clear,
I need to clear it down to the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you've done a lot of
clearing for people who are new to their
[SPEAKER_01]: property and they need to clear things
like scotch broom where I live,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is absolutely heinous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you learn any tricks about clearing
that you would recommend to somebody who
[SPEAKER_01]: is new at clearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it while you're young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotch broom specifically, there's great
tools for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those tools like a weed wrench
and various tools that are specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for small woody things under an inch
diameter stems that give you leverage to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull things out are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work somewhat for blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've learned in land
development is it's really worth just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it right from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a lot of resources at the
time I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this, it would have been worth it to
hire a mini excavator or rent one and just
[SPEAKER_00]: get it done from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that land disturbance early on on land
that you're already transitioning from one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to another where the disturbance
won't make as big of an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the disturbance and then heal the
disturbance with kind of the new paradigm
[SPEAKER_00]: of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: biological pattern happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the suggestion that you're making
that like, you know, as regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, we're looking to do in most
cases, as little disturbance as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you weigh that realistically over time
and over the fact that you needed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get in your crops in order to make
the revenue to sustain the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, all right, well,
I can either do some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: careful disturbance now and and then come
right behind it with a lot of healing,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I can wait and do it the slow way all
by hand and then potentially miss the
[SPEAKER_01]: season, which also will not be good for
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really weighed the type of
disturbance that you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that clarity is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and even in the long term,
like there's the heavy handed disturbance
[SPEAKER_00]: of bringing machinery onto the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you have, say, small diameter
a foot to 18 inch diameter tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't get the roots out,
you will be coming back in with a
[SPEAKER_00]: chainsaw, depending on the species of
trees and burning fuel and using oil again
[SPEAKER_00]: and again and again to keep that held
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, more upfront and
then the lack of disturbance or a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous disturbance to maintain that
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your experience of getting on
the property and then first off,
[SPEAKER_01]: needing to get a greenhouse going is
that's a pretty typical experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to different farmers and I
enjoy hearing how they decided where to
[SPEAKER_01]: place their greenhouse, because on some
properties, it's obvious, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in the one place that gets the
most sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got things like,
you know, a seasonal sun changes or sun is
[SPEAKER_01]: available everywhere on the property,
there can be a lot of competing reasons of
[SPEAKER_01]: placement.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you come to the decision of where
to put your greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I would have loved to have
been on the land for five years before I
[SPEAKER_00]: made any infrastructure commitments,
you know, to kind of see the pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one piece of advice I would give to
new homesteaders is really to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can make infrastructure that's
functional, but not permanent in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: part of homesteading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you do put your greenhouse
somewhere where it makes sense when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first do it, but then it makes less sense
as time goes on, you can take it apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: move it to somewhere new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've seen a lot of land
development, especially around cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, make mistakes as far as that
desire to get in your cash crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first season makes you rush and make kind
of the decisions that you can pull off
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than the decisions you want to see
in the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no way around that to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm kind of wandering off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot the aim of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that you make a good
point that the first step on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: parcel is not to dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first step on the new parcel is to put
down your chair in the middle of the of
[SPEAKER_01]: the of the area and look at it with notes
and and and really like think and dream
[SPEAKER_01]: and plan before you dive into making
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that planning part, you don't want to
short shrift because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of reminds me of, you know,
the whole measure twice cut once idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want to build a
greenhouse and then have to move the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse in the same season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really better to spend a little bit
of time that you think you might be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to might should be doing something else
and really plan out what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do for the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even count the number of times
I've confidently made a design or a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision about something like irrigation,
ordered a bunch of parts, spent money,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it all together, and then realize the
areas where it falls short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people who are coming to their
property also have got limited resources
[SPEAKER_01]: like you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they really struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have really struggled on the OK,
it's it's my first season and I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can either do a a fast and cheap
greenhouse or I can build something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be proud of and will last me a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you know, perhaps I can go even
later in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I get an unexpected snow,
I'll be able to handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how did you weigh that for
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the wanting to not waste
resources, but needed to get something up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also not having the resources to just
throw money at it and make something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make a castle greenhouse right
out of the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, there's a bunch of
approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very fortunate in that I had access
to a wood mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a wooden greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, various approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot available online of used
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get on Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find galvanized conduit,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a conduit vendor to make your
own greenhouses relatively inexpensively
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way my first greenhouse here,
I believe I found an old pile of used PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: at somebody in somebody's yard,
asked them if they were using it and made
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick PVC hoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the following year where I had
actually had time to fell a tree and mill
[SPEAKER_00]: it and and build a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this idea of not only upcycling
your materials in the short term,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that way you can feel a lot easier
about building a temporary greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then as you're able to
collect the higher quality materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: do that the next season or further on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're going to do something
short term, it's great to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: things from from neighbors or shared
online so that you don't have to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: that money and, you know, and also create
new plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you don't need a greenhouse the
first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did because I was hiding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't use a greenhouse,
you start your plants a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you time to prepare your your
outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you plant that and you have a
crop that you can use towards building a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can give this advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't always been advice I've taken
myself, but to bite off what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically chew based on your your
budget and your your time, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have the bad habit of jumping
out of the airplane and then imagining I
[SPEAKER_00]: can sew the parachute before I hit the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I I've I can't say that it's always
worked that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I think that is one of the
challenges for those of us who are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, optimistic, visionary type
folks, because we were always biting off
[SPEAKER_01]: more than we can chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it all looks so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so let's talk about the real star of
the farm, your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I understand the story, when you got
to the farm, it had not actually I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't even really a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the soil had not been cared for in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of us imagine that the soil
in Humboldt County is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: infused with magic and like good all by
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was was your soil already good to go when
you arrived?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you know immediately that you
needed to do soil building?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a combination because
generally the the soil in Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_00]: and around here is a very thin clay soil
is as far as the top soil goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and here we have a vein of of really
quality soil in terms of of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place we are is relatively flat and
and it has a vein of alluvial soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: where two creeks had come back and forth
across and deposited some soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so it has a slightly sandy loam strip
through part of the the flat area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, it was covered in brush
and was very acidic and it needed a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first order of business definitely
was testing that and adjusting the the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring it back to to neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we expanded the farm,
we reached out into more of of the clay
[SPEAKER_00]: poor soil areas of the farm and started
working on those soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you, you know, once you got the pH
back to neutral from all the all the
[SPEAKER_01]: acidity, why don't you kind of illustrate
for us a couple of the processes that you
[SPEAKER_01]: did to like build fertility into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, as we know,
it takes more than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a good pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the soil we want to imbued with with
with microbes and beneficial bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'm sure that you were probably
excited about that part of it because
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, it's my favorite part
because you get to do a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool living projects, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so why don't why don't why don't you
just kind of like go through some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the projects like that that you did to
just increase the the life force in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was relatively lucky in that
generally, unless the soil is really bare,
[SPEAKER_00]: you you have a lot of life force in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we have a forest soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is infused with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the the challenge here in Humboldt and
in similar Mediterranean climates is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets so dry during the summer that it's
kind of like the winter would be if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were in Michigan or something where the
the the season that the life kind of gets
[SPEAKER_00]: put on hold in in that most active layer
of the soil here is in the summer because
[SPEAKER_00]: it dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big part of that for me was
developing the organic matter so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could hold moisture and there could be
life there throughout throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, a big part of it was was
building a stable organic matter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and and stable organic matter is very
different than active breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, both of which you need the
act of breaking down organic matter is the
[SPEAKER_00]: food for the biology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stable organic matter, I kind of think
of as the the housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the well that that your plants can
draw from and the place that the pantry,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a relatively slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the early ways I started putting
stable organic matter into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when I had a much smaller
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm didn't come until until later was
was through biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a lot of of burning here on
the property and learning how to as I did
[SPEAKER_00]: fire safety work and thinning in the
forest, learning how to make burn piles in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that preserved a lot of the
charcoal, then soaking that in like a worm
[SPEAKER_00]: casting tea and then putting that in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have this this repository of
moisture holding and nutrient holding
[SPEAKER_00]: within the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, I was managing the soil with
a bio intensive style rather than a no
[SPEAKER_00]: till style.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you like double dig
everything all the time, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly tiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also really allowed me to to build
up organic matter very, very deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard of no till yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was really excited when I
discovered that about a decade later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, I'm already doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I I don't have to dig everything
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at that point, I was digging
with a shovel and a fork to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same kind of a thing of like keeping
soil structure while aerating and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering techniques to be able to do
that without as much work was was mind
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I didn't understand it when you
first suggested that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I do, that must have been a
really fabulous moment when you when you
[SPEAKER_01]: read a, you know, a defense of not double
digging and realizing that that perhaps it
[SPEAKER_01]: was time for that to end all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's particularly backbreaking work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have felt like, oh, I'm free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was amazing because it kind of
came with as we expanded into being a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger farm, Taylor, my my wife and I,
as we expanded into a larger area here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the property, the first thing we did was
like, well, we obviously can't double dig
[SPEAKER_00]: an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to we have a tiller for our
tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just felt so wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tilled and we were basically
gardening an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this awareness like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't garden this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to learn how to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farming is a different thing than
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we farm in a way that feels
like we're taking care of the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we discovered various literature about
it and discovered techniques to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: and become efficient at the same time as
as becoming better stewards of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this idea that that farming is
different than gardening, that's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: provocative statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: My best understanding of what you're
saying there would be that with with
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening, you're doing things that can be
inefficient because you're not scaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're scaled to a farm,
you have to be far more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're farming, you know,
unfortunately, you're interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: with an economic reality where you can't
lose money the way you can having a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have a hobby where you
spend ten dollars to make a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom tomato for your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work if you're if you're
trying to make a living selling that
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of been the constant
challenge is how how do you scale in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can provide food in an
environmentally friendly way in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves your land in a better state than
you found it and at the same time is
[SPEAKER_00]: economically viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it is a kind of a constant push
and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's no way to do it
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about being regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, when it comes to it,
we're all of us striving towards this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of being regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's it's not something that's
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't in permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about a closed loop system where
where the outputs of your farm become the
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs of your farm and it's a
self-sustaining ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that that's a lot harder when so
much of the output of your farm is leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm never to be returned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so so when you were you were
describing how you were you were double
[SPEAKER_01]: digging until you learned about no till
because, you know, while while that's
[SPEAKER_01]: while that's an, you know, an ancient
process, it's it's a relatively new to
[SPEAKER_01]: trending again, I guess I'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine that at the beginning also
you were probably doing things that that
[SPEAKER_01]: we all know as regenerative farming just
because you had low resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking with a guy I never did get
his name, but at a at a Golden Tarp
[SPEAKER_01]: several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he says he says, oh,
I've been regenerative farmer my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was young, we just called it
being poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because he was focused on using the
materials that are on the property and and
[SPEAKER_01]: because he couldn't afford, you know,
the fertilizers that you'd get from town
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you like, you know,
you described how you wanted to both
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the microbe life, but then also
increase the, you know, what we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to call housing or structure that that
protects it and gives a place for those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to to I want to use the word
procreate, but that's not scientifically
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate, but make more incubate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what what were some of the natural
inputs that you found, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the parcel or nearby that you could
wildcraft and put to work in your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: building it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, early on in building the soil,
I didn't really have the awareness of of
[SPEAKER_00]: wildcrafting inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that kind of the the JDOM KNF kind
of input awareness came came to us maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, I had a lot of wood,
a lot of wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't doing hugel building with large
wood, partly because I had really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't feel like I needed to put
wood in the lower profile of it to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did have is a lot of wood chips
for doing mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although I didn't have animals myself
early on besides chickens for eggs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that manure went back onto the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have friends and neighbors who had
cows and horses and and goats and was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to put a lot of organic matter in the form
of manure and wood chips from from the
[SPEAKER_00]: area onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that that really is like the
input you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is is organic matter, especially in a
place like Humboldt, the flip side of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we were talking about earlier about the
dry season being a time when when microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go dormant if if the soil isn't
kept moist and there's not good moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of it is the wet season here
is 80 plus inches of rain during during
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't hold those nutrients
somehow, they they wash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wash out all all of the soluble
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the biggest issues for us over
the years have always been like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we create nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we hold nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find sulfur?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we hold sulfur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the micronutrients and
minerals, things that wash out of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: here just aren't there unless you find
ways to put them in and to hold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of gardening here,
the single largest way that we've found to
[SPEAKER_00]: build soil is is through wintertime cover
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it just is incredible how much
soil you can build because the winter here
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're not able to grow crops is is
four to six months of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're actually growing a full crop
during that wintertime season entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: just to put back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start doing the the no till
version of it, you're you're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it back on the top, but all of the
roots of those cover crops get to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are in the pathways in the soil
that they've opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That becomes a porous structure of the
soil and the exudates of the roots help
[SPEAKER_00]: create kind of a glue that glues the soil
structure together and then makes a porous
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a cover crop, and you lay
the the the green matter on the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: let that decompose naturally into the top
of the soil and the roots decompose down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the subsoil and in the soil deeper
where they are, you really quickly build
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter deep into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a beautiful explanation,
Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's top notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the engine for all of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The engine for organic matter is
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to take advantage of the
photosynthesis potential on your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: soil all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's either you're you're taking
photosynthesis from another area in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of straw or hay or wood chips or even
animal manure from animals that have eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: that and bringing it to you or your or and
really not or you're creating
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the lovely thing about that is
it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wheelbarrowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not moving it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have it be nitrogen fixing so
that it also creates creates fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to hit one more topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's actually the same topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to ask you one more question
before we go to the first commercial,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, what the specific
overwinter cover crop is going to be is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be different depending on what
part of the country that we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so everybody's going to have their own
local plant that tends to work best for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm curious to hear you speak to is
is number one, did you choose one cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and go solely with that ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you pick a few different cover
crops and and plant them together for
[SPEAKER_01]: variety?
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, how does that crop cover crop fit
into like all of the plants that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: your property?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on your property, I'm assuming that
you're going to have these these seasonal
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crops, but then also your you're
going to have the food that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: for market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the cannabis probably
in the greenhouse and outside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got your ornamentals that
you just grow around your property for
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know as regenerative farmers that
these plants are all interacting with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other at a biological level, even even if
they're not planted right next to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to kind of like hear hear about
like what was the melody for the different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of plants that you chose for the
farm as you settled in and figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going to be best for the farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a number of different
management strategies that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and are developing and will will
change over time for for different goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we manage beds for cannabis is very
different than how we manage beds for
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the big factors are the
crop that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a quick turnaround?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it suffer from from competition from
weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it do fine with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and again, like you just said,
how does it interact with the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our perennial gardens, we just do a
lot of deep mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a variety of plants both for for
beauty that we like for medicinal use for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, for beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis is kind of somewhere
in between a perennial garden and an
[SPEAKER_00]: annual garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is such a long lived annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really plays well with perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the way we manage that tends to be
an in between where we we grow grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop, but we manage it through
crimping and mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the edge of the cannabis beds has
has a perennial garden of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that garden tends to entirely be
beneficial for insects that are predator
[SPEAKER_00]: insects for cannabis or trap crops or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the annual vegetable production,
depending on the crop that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in an area, gets a different management
technique and and needs longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from the wintertime cover crop
to being a very clean, blank, bare slate
[SPEAKER_00]: bed that we could use cedars or
transplanting tools on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've really found that I like in
terms of cover crop is doing a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find a mix that that works for
your environment and works for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but we actually buy a premixed cover
crop that is a combination of fava,
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch, peas and oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and what I like about that is,
is there's an inherent intelligence to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and their interaction with their
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you find different expressions of
what germinates and what thrives in
[SPEAKER_00]: different beds in beds that tend to be low
in nitrogen after a year of growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop you've had on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legumes in that cover crop mix really
thrive in beds that have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the grass really thrives and it's able
to grow a lot before the heaviness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter rains comes and and hold a lot of
that nutrient in its in its structure
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the legumes which are building
building nutrient through its relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: in in its roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so having a mix of cover crop really
helps it thrive in whichever environment
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changes year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I've been able to wrap
my head around predicting what will do
[SPEAKER_00]: well in which area at which time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one aspect we're starting to discover
in in the cannabis zones especially where
[SPEAKER_00]: we use crimping as a technique to
integrate cover crop is that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit if you're if you're using crimping
as a technique to having cover crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: come into flower at the same time because
crimping as a technique really depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if you crimp while a plant is in its
most vigorous growth time it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow right through that push its way
through the mulch you put on top of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus if you cover crop right when a
plant's putting all of its energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering but hasn't produced seeds yet it
tends to actually be killed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: crimping technique and start its
decomposition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cover crop mix we've been using
which we've still used this season the the
[SPEAKER_00]: oats flower at a later time than than the
vetch and the the fava beans so the oats
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow or if I were to wait for
the oats to flower the the fava and the
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch will have already seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a benefit and I know
farmers who are effectively using already
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded cover crop and dry farming somewhat
so they if you are aren't overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: watering say if you have your irrigation
under where you crimp your cover crop so
[SPEAKER_00]: that after you do your cover crop it it it
kind of dries out and becomes mulch you
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a fully seeded cover crop let it
dry out and become mulch your irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: lines are under it and then when you get
fall rains it causes that to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: again and you're already planted in cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's that's theoretical I've heard
some some really amazing farmers talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that but I have not tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to nail that timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to nail that you know and and
getting it to reseed and and all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something I'd love to experiment with
at some point but but haven't gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: yet as it is I'm now looking for an
earlier flowering grain grass that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: mix in with with my my vetch and and my
fava beans to have them at least come into
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition at the same time for effective
crimping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know one thing that is underlying this
this this philosophy that you just shared
[SPEAKER_01]: is that when you're when you're just a
establishing your farm is regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not you just got the parcel or
if you're switching from petroleum farming
[SPEAKER_01]: to regenerative farming sometimes the
first few years as you're getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: legs under you it's it's okay to use the
same kind of like off the shelf like cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop mixes and other other things where
where you don't have to reinvent the wheel
[SPEAKER_01]: like you don't absolutely you don't have
to be inventing all new farming techniques
[SPEAKER_01]: your first couple years there's reasons
why these some of these seed mixes and and
[SPEAKER_01]: other tools are you know there are things
that everybody uses and and so just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know go ahead and follow the crowd on some
of this stuff until you get established
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can really fine-tune it for your
own particular parcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well and it goes back to that biting off
more than you can chew I mean I often
[SPEAKER_00]: still use cover crop mixes because I don't
have the time to wrap my head around every
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of the farm and farmers are doing
it especially now there's so many small
[SPEAKER_00]: farms out there there there is so much
thought being put into this and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of products out there that
are made by farmers with the thought of of
[SPEAKER_00]: helping farmers and especially like in the
tool realm and things like that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot available you don't need to do it all
yourself you couldn't even if you tried
[SPEAKER_00]: and part of learning to farm was learning
to focus on what we're good at and and to
[SPEAKER_00]: let other people do what they're good at
and be collaborative about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on that's good those are good words
of advice so all right so let's take a
[SPEAKER_01]: short break and be right back you're
listening to shaping fire and my guest
[SPEAKER_01]: today is regenerative farmer Daniel Stein
and you know without these advertisers
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping fire would not happen so please
support them and let them know you heard
[SPEAKER_01]: them on shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Revenue is tight for cannabis businesses
right now there is no question about it
[SPEAKER_01]: and when revenue tightens businesses need
to spend smarter on advertising instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing obscene money at hanging your
company's logo from the rafters at your
[SPEAKER_01]: next convention perhaps consider placing
commercials on shaping fire and if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: a very small business there is simply no
better bang for your buck than commercials
[SPEAKER_01]: on shaping fire especially if your
products are for regeneratively minded
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advertising on this show allows us time to
talk about your product service or brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that really lets people know what
sets your company apart from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bold people who own companies know that
getting into relationship with their
[SPEAKER_01]: customers is essential that is what we
offer we will explain your service or
[SPEAKER_01]: product what sets it apart as desirable
and help our audience get in contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: you it's pretty simple really advertising
does not have to be always bang smoke and
[SPEAKER_01]: mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays I find that people prefer just to
be spoken to calmly accurately and with
[SPEAKER_01]: good intentions if you want to make your
own commercial spot you can do that too
[SPEAKER_01]: with a commercial on shaping fire you'll
reach your customers in the privacy of
[SPEAKER_01]: their headphones right now and will
continue to reach new listeners as they
[SPEAKER_01]: explore the shaping fire back catalog of
episodes again and again for years a spot
[SPEAKER_01]: on shaping fire costs less than a postcard
per person and the shaping fire audience
[SPEAKER_01]: is full of smart cannabis enthusiasts
cultivators and entrepreneurs who are
[SPEAKER_01]: always curious to learn and right now in
the new year we are booking the few open
[SPEAKER_01]: spots we have for the rest of 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to be one of our new
advertisers do yourself a solid and

[SPEAKER_01]: Fish poop brand fertilizer is an all
natural fish poop concentrate with nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: added real fish poop is extraordinarily
complex not only are you adding the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen phosphorus and potassium your
plants need to build mass transport
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients enhance flavor but fish waste is
also packed with biological activity and
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients when you add fish poop to
your irrigation water you are adding life
[SPEAKER_01]: force probiotics and active microbes these
microorganisms include a wealth of various
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and protozoa which further
enhance nutrient availability for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because plants are limited by the
absence of any essential micronutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: these trace nutrients are the difference
between having a decent garden and having
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden that makes you feel really proud
of your efforts fish poop is a naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: complete solution that fills in the cracks
in your fertilizer program to ensure you
[SPEAKER_01]: offer your garden a broad base of
nutrients not all fish poop is created
[SPEAKER_01]: equally most products with added fish
waste don't reveal their sources or lab
[SPEAKER_01]: results fish poop brand fish poop however
generates their own fish waste as a
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of their organic aquaponics
cannabis farm where they raise ornamental
[SPEAKER_01]: koi and tilapia you are even invited to
tour their farm in person or on their
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel to look for yourself this
sort of transparency is wildly rare in the

call half of their garden as males the
[SPEAKER_01]: folks growing for the fun of getting high
grew colorful flowers with a exceptional

[SPEAKER_01]: along with photos and descriptions that's
Humboldt CSI.com welcome back you are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to shaping fire I'm your host
Shango Los and my guest today is
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farmer Daniel Stein so before
the break we were talking about the the
[SPEAKER_01]: initial things to do or at least
considerations as you are setting up your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm to become regenerative rather or not
whether you are post petroleum or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just your first time on the property now
one of the things that Daniel hit on was
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know if you're building up all
this soil you don't want it all to get
[SPEAKER_01]: washed away and so that's what we're going
to start with Daniel you know water
[SPEAKER_01]: retention is really important you know
across the country but especially where
[SPEAKER_01]: you live because you like I we have this
this drought portion of the summer and and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's lots of there's lots of laws
rurally about what you can and can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: with water and if you find yourself
without water and you're far out like you
[SPEAKER_01]: are off-grid it's not like you can just
turn on the faucet and then suddenly there
[SPEAKER_01]: it is absolutely and you also mentioned
that you know not only do you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: retain the water but you also need to
control the flow of water so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: water doesn't take away all the nutrients
that you're putting in all this effort
[SPEAKER_01]: building into the soil so I'd like you to
talk through yeah let's you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain use your property as example but
I'd like you to talk about it more
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretically so it so it applies to many
people's farms talk about water retention
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning how you can sequester the water on
your property strategies to do that so the
[SPEAKER_01]: water stays and then second how you
control the flow so that it doesn't wash
[SPEAKER_00]: all the good hard work you've done away
yeah well there's a number of strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: and it really depends on on your
individual situation needs and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going for for your farm I mean the answer
to so many of of the issues is organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter organic matter is how you can hold
water like a sponge it's how you can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients it's how you can you can buffer
high rainfall high water events it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer to so much when it comes to
farming and then in in terms of of water
[SPEAKER_00]: flow if you're trying if your site doesn't
get enough water retention throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season the main thing you want to do is is
get more water to it and and so doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things like swales where where you slow
down the water coming across your property
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it to go into into your system
help that that's in my environment that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not something I've ever really had to do
with 80 inches of rain everything that can
[SPEAKER_00]: get saturated get saturated without the
help of bringing more water into it and as
[SPEAKER_00]: a matter of fact doing swales is something
you have to be careful about because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you super saturate areas you could deal
with with landslides if it's in the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong kind of an area we do use some of
those techniques less about retaining
[SPEAKER_00]: water and more about slowing water down in
areas that we have plantings that can
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake some of those nutrients that that
would flow out with water so low on our
[SPEAKER_00]: property we have some swales that are are
planted in in comfrey and other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are deep rooted so it can slow any
water down and and we can hopefully remove
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the nutrients that would be
flowing out with that water and turn them
[SPEAKER_00]: back into plant material that we can
harvest and bring up to to the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: system again but it definitely is organic
matter organic matter is the sponge it it
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces water the speed flowing through
sandy soil it increases the drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of clay soil it it brings
everything into balance I believe this
[SPEAKER_01]: next question you just answered and it's
going to be organic material but I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask it anyway because a lot of people
run into it you know a lot of parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country and and it's probably even going
to become more common to have a drought
[SPEAKER_01]: period during the summer and when that
happens you know the the topsoil gets you
[SPEAKER_01]: know dusty and and in many places it gets
hydrophobic so that when the rain does
[SPEAKER_01]: start it doesn't immediately go into the
in the topsoil and it and it runs and and
[SPEAKER_01]: so people really rely on on these
permaculture solutions like swales to to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide it and to and to also slow it down
do you find like the question is what do
[SPEAKER_01]: you what strategy do you most like to
fight the likelihood of hydrophobic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: so that when the rains first start for the
year you don't lose a lot of important
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and soil chemistry before the soil
opens up well mulch being kind of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: when it when it's something that you can
work with like if you're in a cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system where you can do a heavy mulch if
you can afford to either bring a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: straw on or use wood chips for mulch that
will break up the water it'll slow it down
[SPEAKER_00]: that works for much of our farm for a lot
of the the vegetable side of it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't mulch around radishes that are
in the ground for four weeks and then pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the mulch and replant each time so we do
have a lot of beds that that end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively bare soil even though there
there's cover crop planted and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: will sprout quickly after the first rains
one of the main things we do for that
[SPEAKER_00]: where we don't we don't have control of it
through something on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is making sure that all of our beds
are on contour so in a way they act like
[SPEAKER_00]: swales so our beds are on contour and even
though we don't have much of a slope the
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on contour and they're slightly
raised above the pathways so that if we do
[SPEAKER_00]: lose any soil from erosion it goes into
the pathways and then every couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: we we come through and we put the the the
soil and and broken down wood chip mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: and various things that have built up in
the pathways back on top of the beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: it acts like another kind of a boost it's
like putting compost on top of the beds so
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier you mentioned trap plants and in
addition to that and and perhaps you can
[SPEAKER_01]: explain the kind of trap plants that you
like how do you manage pests on your
[SPEAKER_00]: property well different pests different
ways I mean there there are pests that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can manage effectively through encouraging
the natural balance and then there are
[SPEAKER_00]: pests that come out of balance pests that
we can deal with effectively through the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural balance we we encourage plants
that are are an ecosystem an environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that encourages natural predators and
often for us those are our umbles things
[SPEAKER_00]: like Queen Anne's Lace, Sweet Alyssum,
various flowers one thing that I a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't don't realize is that the the
stage of of much of many of the predators
[SPEAKER_00]: that attack pests say if it's aphids or
thrips or something like that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: predators that attack those pests are the
larval stage of of the predator and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult stage that you need to have
around in order to lay the eggs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place to have the larval stage eat
nectar and pollen from specific plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: so when you talk about beneficial plants
it's all often you're providing the food
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment for the adult stage of
of a beneficial insect that will then go
[SPEAKER_00]: lay its eggs in aphid bodies or lay larvae
that then crawl around on the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: and eat thrips things like that the the
trap crops are are interesting because the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of a trap crop is having having a
plant that your pests desire more than
[SPEAKER_00]: your cash crop and one of the main ones we
use in our cannabis is is actually catnip
[SPEAKER_00]: works really well for mites mites seem to
prefer catnip over cannabis any day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week and and it provides an environment so
if we do have something out of balance we
[SPEAKER_00]: can if we're using beneficial insects we
can release the beneficial insects into
[SPEAKER_00]: the trap crop where there's a large
population of of the pest and they can eat
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest they can breed and then they can
branch out from there where if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying an expensive beneficial
insect and putting it on say a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that has a smattering of a pest not
not to an epidemic proportion you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting a lot of a lot of that insect
they'll they'll mostly die off of
[SPEAKER_01]: starvation if they can't find their food I
like this idea and that is common in
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative agriculture that that these
pests are usually coming because the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden is out of balance and it's it
swings one way or another to dry to wet to
[SPEAKER_01]: to whatever and and and when it's out of
balance it creates opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pests to expand and then you've
got a problem and I think it's really fun
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I tour regenerative farms
there's there's just such a diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants right it's it's it's it's the
complete opposite of a monoculture yeah of
[SPEAKER_01]: course we've got we've got these you know
fields of cannabis but then you've got you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know all these smaller plants and
then and then cover crops and then
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamentals that are just pretty for the
farm and and they're all growing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: in the summer which is normally when I do
my tours they're all flowering and
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous and they smell good and you can
you can feel the balance of the farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that the the number one
solution for pests on regenerative farms
[SPEAKER_01]: is just to grow a lot and a lot of variety
because I certainly have got great results
[SPEAKER_01]: from adding beneficial insects as well but
but you're you're speaking the truth man
[SPEAKER_01]: when you when you say that if you if
you're if your garden isn't already out of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance there might not be enough food for
the beneficial insects to keep them going
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's really going to be better for
you to instead of of spot trying to fix a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem really focus on the biological
diversity and the flowering and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity so that the plants that you want
they choose to come to your farm and they
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to do their life cycle on your farm
and then you can save some money on the
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals like beneficial insects for
when you actually have a problem and and
[SPEAKER_00]: you need some first aid yeah and
absolutely absolutely and even even there
[SPEAKER_00]: within that our farm isn't an island it is
in a greater environment and so as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen more proliferation of large cannabis
farms as we've had to move towards using
[SPEAKER_00]: clones things like that more more pests
become an issue like the the hemp aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: did not exist for us in any way many years
ago and never would have if we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: some large cannabis farms in our area that
proliferated them and that that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pest poses a unique problem because our
the way our environment will is bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: that pest into balance is through a number
of predators but one of the primary ones
[SPEAKER_00]: is the surfed fly or hover fly and there
are those little things that kind of look
[SPEAKER_00]: like bees but they're shaped like flies if
you've ever seen them for sure and and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're wonderful the the issue is that
the hemp aphid comes late in the season
[SPEAKER_00]: during budding often or early budding and
the surfed flies follow them and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the surfed fly feeds on on the aphid is by
by laying eggs which hatch and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: into larvae which then crawl around and or
squirm around they kind of look like
[SPEAKER_00]: maggots and and eat aphids and aphid eggs
now the issue with that is it is bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: it into balance and it is getting rid of
the aphids oftentimes there's no aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: left in on on plants where where the
surfed flies have worked but they also
[SPEAKER_00]: leave eggs and larvae inside of butts so
the the most extreme version of this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years ago I knew of a jar brand
and and the the surfed fly larvae will
[SPEAKER_00]: remain dormant at certain temperatures but
then develop at room temperature over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of two weeks so there was a jarred
brand that that had organic regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in it and because it was organic
and there were aphids there was surfed fly
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae that had once it was put on the
shelf in the dispensary at room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature had hatched and become flies
inside of the jar which really makes for
[SPEAKER_00]: bad branding yeah that's a really bad
brand experience for sure so that that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular balance does not work for us we
can't encourage surfed flies as the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: for aphids even though our natural
environment wants that to be the balance
[SPEAKER_00]: so we do have to work with with beneficial
insects to control the aphids early on so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't have what is essentially a
beneficial insect hurt the the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: our flower down the line wow that's really
thoughtful not only so so the so the
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids are the original pest and the
surfed flies are the original beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: but due to the nature of the surfed flies
the surfed flies actually becomes a pest
[SPEAKER_01]: because of their larvae in the flowers and
so actually you need a third party outside
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insect that will take out the
aphids before the aphids get so
[SPEAKER_00]: significant that they attract the surfed
flies yeah and so we do introduce green
[SPEAKER_00]: lacewing which are natural here but never
seem to build up enough of a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: population fast enough to deal with the
the hemp aphid which doesn't exist here
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally along with cannabis which also
doesn't exist here naturally so it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that that it is sometimes hard for
the natural system to come into balance
[SPEAKER_00]: with these essentially exotic plants they
the the lar the lacewing isn't able to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up a population quick enough to deal
with just the incredibly rapid rate at
[SPEAKER_00]: which hemp aphids proliferate well so um
and hemp aphids do like there's it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to variety there there's there's strains
that they seem to like no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy they are that there's something
about them they like and they're strange
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't seem to like and and not all
oftentimes it is there is an imbalance in
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm that causes a pest to like
something but there there's oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: pests that that do really well uh um
attacking plants and and it might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant's out of balance it might
just be that that plant has not developed
[SPEAKER_00]: with a resistance to that particular pest
because they known each other long enough
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean that makes sense especially with
you know some of these uh the the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that that that are like a far cry
away from uh land races sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes they just absolutely so they
just don't have that depth of uh of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic protection they've they've never
seen the sun even so they've never been
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of indoor yeah um so let's let's
uh shift gears to um uh to animals on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property um so far uh you have mentioned
uh chickens as far as animal husbandry
[SPEAKER_01]: goes and and using uh manures from
neighbors farms but that that was way in
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning so so so now that you are
more established perhaps you have other
[SPEAKER_01]: animals too but but whether whether the
animals are yours or whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing them from elsewhere um speak a
little bit if you would to um how uh
[SPEAKER_01]: animal um inputs if you will uh whether
it's their manure or their their their
[SPEAKER_01]: body uh how how those are being
incorporated into the cycle on your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah absolutely well i mean number one
it's the the relationship with humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and farming it all kind of evolved
together right and the the way i see it is
[SPEAKER_00]: animals have developed incredible
microbiomes um to be able to digest and
[SPEAKER_00]: process raw rough food and come out with a
fertilizer basically so goats are the the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary large animal we have on our farm
and our goats free roam a large area
[SPEAKER_00]: around our homestead they're not fenced in
our homestead is fenced and and the goats
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything else um and what they do
is is they gather food they they go around
[SPEAKER_00]: they they eat a wide variety of food they
they come back to the barn three times a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and where they pee and they poop and
and they they make uh an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: compost that we can gather and and add to
our intentional compost piles every year
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's another way besides wood chips
which are very slow slow to degrade and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a lot of nutritive value in
terms of um in terms of macronutrients um
[SPEAKER_00]: it's another way for us to to gather
biomass from our surrounding area bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: here onto our farm and process it into
kind of a super fertilizer um and and an
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculant of microbiology i want to i want
to poke at that bit did you did you really
[SPEAKER_01]: mean to suggest that the that the goats
come back to the farm to poop and that
[SPEAKER_01]: they they don't just drop it wherever they
are walking around they absolutely drop it
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever they are walking around okay no
no so they they come back to the barn
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're always pooping right on
okay i was gonna i was gonna say a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: their poop ends up at the barn what they
do is they'll roam around and then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and loaf and hang out at the
barn and drink water and during that time
[SPEAKER_00]: they're continuing to poop all right great
the way i heard it i'm really do they come
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the barn as a toilet i've never
heard that about goats but but now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really developing our our animal training
don't pee not yet no yeah hold it till you
[SPEAKER_01]: get back to the barn all right i i
understand more clearly now they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just always pooping and and they
naturally come back to the barn for
[SPEAKER_01]: shelter and water and they drop a load
there too yeah all right very good um so
[SPEAKER_01]: when when you bring in manure from another
property um how suspicious are you of that
[SPEAKER_01]: manure like like how much do you want to
know about those animals before you're
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to bring the manure onto your
property you you want to know a lot um you
[SPEAKER_00]: know early on i brought horse manure on
and and there's a couple aspects with
[SPEAKER_00]: horse manure horses are basically pets to
a lot of people most people worm their
[SPEAKER_00]: horses continuously and um so wormer
horses things kind of pass straight
[SPEAKER_00]: through horses so if somebody is giving
their horse horse wormer you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: have wormer in the manure yeah so you want
to ask those kinds of questions are your
[SPEAKER_00]: horses being fed any medication another
aspect with horse manure is because things
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through horses um something about the
way they process you they they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: process a lot of magnesium so horse manure
is high in magnesium that will build up
[SPEAKER_00]: over time if that's the one manure you're
using and you'll get an imbalance between
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium and magnesium in your soil um
right now one of our primary manure inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: is from an organic dairy where we we get
probably 40 to 50 yards of of dairy manure
[SPEAKER_00]: solids from an organic dairy which is
wonderful it's great material um one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges with that is that they they
dust the feeding stalls in the barn so so
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that works is is that the cows get
milked they go to to a large barn with
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding stalls and then they go back out
to pasture and while they poop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding stalls that gets washed in into a
trough where the solids are separated from
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquids we get the solids the liquids
get watered back out onto pasture but they
[SPEAKER_00]: dust down those feeding stalls with wood
ash so now that we've been using that
[SPEAKER_00]: manure for a while we're starting to see
an intense buildup of potassium salts from
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood ash and so we're having to manage
this this great biomass that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at at a good price delivered to us
with dealing with potassium toxicity as as
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential outcome of that if we don't
manage it properly what does management of
[SPEAKER_01]: that look like that's a pretty exotic
concern for me um it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly common with a lot of of heavy
compost applications and especially manure
[SPEAKER_00]: applications um but the the way it works
for us is we just make sure we age the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost really well and we don't add
potassium in any other facets it's like we
[SPEAKER_00]: used to add potassium in our amendments to
our farm and we just don't do that anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: we make sure that doesn't happen and if we
see signs um i believe one of the one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the aspects of potassium toxicity is a
reduced uptake of manganese i believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: is and a reduced uptake of manganese
during the first few weeks of a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle on cannabis could cause really small
buds especially at the top so when you see
[SPEAKER_00]: like larger buds lower down on your
flowering stalk and as it comes towards
[SPEAKER_00]: what should be the nice top cola on a
stalk it kind of flattens out and and
[SPEAKER_00]: stops developing into a larger bud that
could often be a manganese toxicity a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of manganese which either could be a
potassium toxicity it also could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese uptake didn't happen because the
temperatures were too low for the uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: for that particular strain during its
first few weeks of flowering a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that but but it's like paying close
attention to to what we're seeing on on
[SPEAKER_00]: the the growing end of it and seeing if
we're seeing those effects right on so
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been we've been talking a lot about
specifics i want to i want to pull back
[SPEAKER_01]: our focus for a minute and and kind of
give you an opportunity maybe for a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of storytelling because if we go back
to you know where we are now in talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about your about your farm and using it as
an example farm you've got very
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated and and experience rich
solutions whereas at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show we were talking about your very young
and immature farm when and when you had no
[SPEAKER_01]: money and like doing the best you can with
what you've got and so we know that over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 25-ish years your your experience
has been increasing and the farm's depth
[SPEAKER_01]: has been increasing and which sets us up
for this question i'm curious if there
[SPEAKER_01]: were you know were there any milestones
that you experienced which told you that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were having a really positive impact
on the biological diversity of the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and that things were getting better like
in the soil and in the i don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: biosphere of of of your farm when you know
signs that when you saw it you just like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stopped you're like oh man we're
doing it we're doing it i i there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of that i mean i i kind of walk around
every day and feel that like oh my god
[SPEAKER_00]: this is this is amazing it's it's
happening it's working um i remember
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically uh the the first regenerative
cannabis conference i don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were there i wasn't at the first one no it
was it was right here in my neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: it was at at uh... beginnings in in
briseland here and it was relatively small
[SPEAKER_00]: and i uh... i had a few people who were
there a few of the presenters come up into
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick little of the farm and and one of
the presenters was uh... a mycologist who
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on mycorrhizal mycology and he
said oh this is cool you've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the same area for for ten
years or whatever it was at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more than that can i take a
sample and and do a mycological study of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that sounds amazing and so he got back
to me about a week later and he said the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores of the specific mycorrhizal fungi
that have relationship with cannabis are
[SPEAKER_00]: dense enough in this soil that you could
cut it by ten parts and sell it as an
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate wow that must afford you i was
like what the heck well i i didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: and i was like well does that mean we're
doing a good job or that commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants are ridiculous and he said a
little of both right yeah that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic and to to know that um that you
know it was your your soil was that
[SPEAKER_01]: fungally rich um it really gives you um an
understanding that you've got like room
[SPEAKER_01]: for error right because you're you're not
barely getting by your your soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually bursting and and you know i some
of it i i think you just end up with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of happy accidents you know um like i i
have thought a lot you know while i'm on
[SPEAKER_00]: my way to bed and don't have a piece of
paper things like that of you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of of of mycorrhizal relationships
now there's a difference between um spores
[SPEAKER_00]: and active mycorrhizal that that are in
the soil and there's active mycorrhizal on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis roots what what makes
mycorrhizal go into kind of a suspended
[SPEAKER_00]: state is not having those relationships so
if you go into a winter time where your
[SPEAKER_00]: soils bear the mycorrhizal that's alive no
longer is there's spores maybe maybe it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: build up again but it'll take longer to
build up again in the spring and i've i've
[SPEAKER_00]: been curious and i actually haven't done
the research or looked at it it's like is
[SPEAKER_00]: there specific cover crops that that have
the same mycorrhizal relationships with
[SPEAKER_00]: the same species as does a cannabis crop
or a crop you're growing for that summer
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can encourage a continuity of
those species because you know we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of uh you know if you if you go on
instagram and you look at people's
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts everybody um posts these pictures
of incredible mycelium in their soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of those species are wonderful
they're good to have in your soil they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the species that break down um woody
material or unbroken down organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: and and provide nutrients from it but then
the specific fungal mats the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: specific mycorrhizal relationships that
that directly benefit the cannabis um in a
[SPEAKER_00]: more direct way relationship way how do we
keep those alive how do we proliferate
[SPEAKER_00]: those and and are there cover crops or or
perennial plantings that share enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same species to be able to be the the
kind of safe space for for those living
[SPEAKER_01]: species to to overwinter yeah because you
don't you don't want the the the really
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial ones for cannabis like
interocetes to suddenly be out competed by
[SPEAKER_01]: like um wood digesters only you know
exactly and and that's mostly what you see
[SPEAKER_00]: it like no shade on anyone i i love
posting pictures of of all my you know
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal mats when i find them but
almost always it's wood digesters whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know wine caps or or the
stropharia kind of mushrooms um that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you see a lot because they're
they're the way we're gardening the way
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing things whether it's through
hugel beds or through a lot of uh of
[SPEAKER_00]: addition of carbon in the form of mulch
really favors the wood digesters yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: right on all right so let's go ahead and
take our second uh short break we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: right back you are listening to shaping
fire and my guest today is regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer daniel stein you've heard me talk
about the award-winning cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that come from the analytical breeding
program of seth and eric crofford who
[SPEAKER_01]: founded oregon cbd seeds in fact seth was
a guest on shaping fire in 2020 to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about triploid genetics seth and eric are
now releasing high thc seeds for home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and farms as grow the revolution
seeds at gtrseeds.com their high thc seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: are extraordinary in that they will start
to flower at 16 and a half hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: daylight instead of the typical 14 and a
half hours of daylight that means in most
[SPEAKER_01]: regions your plants will start to flower
outdoors in the middle of july instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of august which means these
photo period plants finish in september
[SPEAKER_01]: and not october totally upending the photo
period seed market seth and eric took
[SPEAKER_01]: their prized early flowering cbg line and
bred it to some of the most desired
[SPEAKER_01]: verified genetics out there including sour
diesel triangle kush wedding cake chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs skittles and others these crosses all
express powerful photo period terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and thc giving you a great high
gtr seeds has a new thc v line with plants
[SPEAKER_01]: like double durbin and gigantor that boast
one-to-one thc to thcv and people want
[SPEAKER_01]: that thcv gtr seeds are very consistent
true growing inbred f1s from stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred parent lines these seeds are nearly
homogeneous and the plants should all grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the same there is only one phenotype in
every pack available as diploids and
[SPEAKER_01]: triploids seth and eric's company is still
family owned patient employee centric and
[SPEAKER_01]: partially powered by their two acres of
solar panels everyone can purchase these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and the entire catalog of oregon cbd
seeds at gtr seeds dot com go to gtr seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: dot com today and choose something
revolutionary for your next indoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor run after you've caught up on the
latest shaping fire episodes do you
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes wish there was more cannabis
education available to learn well we got
[SPEAKER_01]: you shaping fire has a fabulous youtube
channel with content not found on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast when i attend conventions to speak
or moderate panels i always record them
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring the content home for you to
watch the shango los youtube channel has
[SPEAKER_01]: world-class speakers including zoe sigmans
lecture understanding your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system kevin jodry of wonderland nursery

[SPEAKER_01]: one of the challenges with buying auto
flower seeds is that often you'll have as
[SPEAKER_01]: many different phenos as you will have
seeds in a pack that can be fun sure but
[SPEAKER_01]: so many varieties in one pack is a sign of
an immature seed line that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: worked enough i prefer my auto flowers to
be worked enough that each phenom in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pack really captures the aspects that the
breeder was intending this is why i
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend gnome automatics to my friends
and listeners who grow automatic flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis seeds gnome automatic seeds are
not just crossed and released they are
[SPEAKER_01]: painstakingly sifted again and again
tested in a wide range of conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: taken to a level of maturity that each
plant will be recognizable by its traits
[SPEAKER_01]: traits that were hard earned so that you
can have your best growth cycle ever over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 years gnome automatics founder
dan jimmy has become a trusted breeder and
[SPEAKER_01]: he continues to pour his passion of
breeding cannabis into every variety he
[SPEAKER_01]: releases for you to grow check out the
gnome automatics instagram at gnome
[SPEAKER_01]: underscore automatics to see the
impressive plants folks are growing you
[SPEAKER_01]: can score gnome automatic seeds in
feminized or regular at your favorite seed
[SPEAKER_01]: provider listed in the vendor section of
their website commercial cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_01]: across the country love growing gnome
automatics because of their consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed to seed short grow times thc
percentages and colorful bag appeal farms

[SPEAKER_01]: listening to shaping fire i am your host
shango los and today my guest is
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farmer daniel stein so daniel
during this last section i want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about um some macro ideas um around land
management and and let's start with crop
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation um you know we talked a lot
during the first set about um the the joy
[SPEAKER_01]: of planning the farm and and how that plan
can evolve over the years and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't have to do everything the
first year um but you know one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges that people get into is they
really kind of fall in love with their
[SPEAKER_01]: farm design and and where things go and so
everything has a place but but as
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farmers we also know the
benefit that comes from crop rotation so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not trying to feed the same crop
with the same soil all the time but gosh
[SPEAKER_01]: um it's really easy to not rotate um crops
um different farmers i've spoken to will
[SPEAKER_01]: either rotate and some will be like well i
just choose to amend and not rotate um i'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to hear what your thoughts are um i
think my thoughts on this is is do what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see you see where rotations are
important for you and and where they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't um and sometimes it's self-limiting
for instance with cannabis we couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate because we had such a hard time
explaining to the regulatory agencies what
[SPEAKER_00]: crop rotation is and we didn't feel like
redrawing and resubmitting our maps every
[SPEAKER_00]: year um and but what's interesting is that
led us to a discovery which is that i
[SPEAKER_00]: think cannabis likes to grow in the same
spot and when i started thinking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and and imagining cannabis growing in the
wild you know like a ditch weed for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance cannabis produces a ton of seeds
that fall right there and and regrow right
[SPEAKER_00]: there um so i think cannabis as a plant is
used to growing in its own shadow i guess
[SPEAKER_00]: you would say um and you know that doesn't
change the fact that crop rotation can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce pest pressure especially pests that
tend to overwinter in the soil or things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that or wouldn't be beneficial but i
i think for us for our different crops we
[SPEAKER_00]: weighed the benefit of crop rotation
versus the challenge of crop rotation and
[SPEAKER_00]: decide individually on each thing um you
know for instance in our vegetable farm we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a block that is lettuce production
that we don't rotate because the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure that it takes for us to
have year-round lettuce production in this
[SPEAKER_00]: hot arid climate doesn't lend itself well
to rotation and lettuce doesn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem in terms of nutrient use or pest
and with rotation things like um garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: and tomatoes and carrots we tend to rotate
and primarily our rotation for those isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient based because we are so well
provided with nutrients through compost
[SPEAKER_00]: our rotation tends to be what crops do a
good job of reducing weed pressure for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next crop that doesn't do well with weed
pressure like for instance carrots might
[SPEAKER_00]: come after zucchini because zucchini
reduce the the seed bank of weeds in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area and then carrots can come after them
and things like that so it's one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things uh cover it's more important to
plant stuff and get it in the ground than
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it just right because um at the end
of the day you'd rather have a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot that's not perfect than not to have
any carrots um and it's similar to how i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel about uh planting with moon cycles
like plant it out try to plant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: moon cycles if you don't miss it if you
miss it don't wait a month to plant again
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's better to have it growing a
month than to to hit it on exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: energetic cycle um so that bit that you
said about right on do your best that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good theme for today you know that you
kind of blew my mind at the at the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: your answer when you when you pointed out
that cannabis seeds when mature are pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the flower and just dropped to the
ground at its own feet and start next
[SPEAKER_01]: year's plants right there at its feet you
know they're they're not they're not air
[SPEAKER_01]: distributed and and while while they could
be distributed by birds that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really not their main schtick they really
are they crack them open and then there
[SPEAKER_01]: you go so so they don't even they don't
even survive the process so um yeah that
[SPEAKER_01]: that really kind of sets crop rotation for
cannabis in my head in a totally in a
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different realm i'm already
envisioning the the next time i talk to a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiologist about the difference
between um the root structures of of of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that need to be cover or not cover
crop need to be rotated versus ones who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't because i'm sure that life in the
rhizosphere is entirely different for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are are built to be the same
location every year yeah and and that
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal relationship is there too it's
like the roots of the previous year are
[SPEAKER_00]: there with all of its microbiology while
you plant the next year yeah and they must
[SPEAKER_01]: have very burly exudates too i'd imagine
so sure does seem like it yeah right on so
[SPEAKER_01]: so let's let's talk about another variety
of land management other than crop
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation so you know we we've been talking
about different parts of your parcel and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they relate but really if we if we
pull the pull the camera out your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: parcel is one big um land mass of growing
as well um what kinds of forward-thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: big picture land management do you use on
the parcel as a whole i'm thinking stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like controlled burns and things like that
that can regenerate the property itself
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah exactly um so our homestead is
perhaps five to ten acres of of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall parcel and we're on 170 acres most
of it is forested and relatively steep um
[SPEAKER_00]: and here in northern california our our
native forest environment has been very
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by by extractive land management
and the exclusion of native cultural land
[SPEAKER_00]: management um so when we're looking at the
overall property we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how we take it from this state
where it's out of balance because of
[SPEAKER_00]: logging and fire suppression and get it
back into its natural balance which for
[SPEAKER_00]: this area is is a natural fire regimen and
more of an old growth less less trees more
[SPEAKER_00]: space between the trees more biodiversity
um so yeah we're we're looking intensely
[SPEAKER_00]: at that we've we've partnered with uh some
local non-profits that work on on
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed restoration we're doing some big
in-depth studies of of how groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: moves through the the soil here basically
in this area geologically we have a a
[SPEAKER_00]: bedrock layer that's relatively
impenetrable by water on a lot of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a 20 to 30 foot deep soil sponge on
top of that and and um we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: aquifers our summertime water is the water
that slowly moves through that sponge from
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ridges down to the creeks and out
so where we have groundwater wells where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're studying infiltration from rain how
long it stays in the soil where it moves
[SPEAKER_00]: through the watershed and then we're going
to be doing some some um forest
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration work thinning and limbing and
just kind of every bringing it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: balance forest restoration work we could
do in that area and seeing how that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes the water flow through that
watershed and then moving on after we get
[SPEAKER_00]: to study that for a couple of years to
doing a prescribed fire in that area and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how that affects water infiltration
and does it affect the ph of the
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater and how does that change the
soil structure and things like that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of the long range is looking
towards how we get this large parcel back
[SPEAKER_00]: to a place where we can manage it through
the use of prescribed natural fire and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also what land management techniques
we can use on a closer level and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where things like the goats come in
they're kind of like a biological fire
[SPEAKER_00]: where they consume a lot of the biomass
around around our area and keep it down so
[SPEAKER_00]: so not only does it get into a better
balance but it keeps us fire safe we are
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fire prone environment because of
this out of balance with fire that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: it is um it's very catastrophic when it
happens as we all know yeah um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that you talk about these bigger
projects which um it's amazing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are able to find time or create time to do
something that that is that big and
[SPEAKER_01]: future-minded versus just the daily
demands of a farm but really that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: effort that you put in it's it's like the
farming um equivalent of generational
[SPEAKER_01]: wealth you know it's like it's like you're
you're doing these studies and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how the the the farm parcel will
be will be better over time with your eye
[SPEAKER_01]: on 20 and 30 years out so that the you
know you can be a participant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of the nature around you but
also that um your farm has got a reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: backbone uh you know in case in case your
your kids want to take it over in time or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that and i think that's i
think that's philosophically really uh
[SPEAKER_01]: important to regenerative farming and and
often given short shrift well and land
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership is funny it's like um you know
i'm here now maybe my kids will be here
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they won't but this land will be
here either way and in terms of like time
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this i'm i'm super fortunate i have
great partnerships um i'm do some grant
[SPEAKER_00]: writing but i'm working with local
non-profits that are doing the grant
[SPEAKER_00]: writing actually doing the work and i'm
just coordinating with them to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's happening oh that's great um it's
it's wonderful having people like that
[SPEAKER_00]: working on your behalf yeah it's
incredible and you know to some degree
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the openness to it and the the
engaging in the community constantly in
[SPEAKER_00]: these spheres of you know a a big part
here as the economy is shifting here as as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis economy has changed and gotten
integrated into this larger broken economy
[SPEAKER_01]: saying it's shifting is like the the the
nicest possible way to put what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: around you yeah i mean think it's honestly
it's coming into balance but on
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately it's coming into balance
with a broken system yeah it sure is and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's kind of the way it goes but
oh one of the economies that is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to take some of that um burden is is the
restoration economy what we have here is
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible amount of a beautiful
forested land in our area and it it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: work it needs restoration if we're going
to have healthy fisheries if we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a fire safe community etc so um you
kind of set me up perfectly these next two
[SPEAKER_01]: questions are uh economics based and the
first one is um uh you know what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: economic impact of switching to
regenerative farming you know on a small
[SPEAKER_01]: farm you weren't you weren't petroleum
based to begin with so it wasn't that much
[SPEAKER_01]: of a swing but um you certainly stopped
you know double digging and and other uh
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially laborious uh practices but you
probably also traded those for other
[SPEAKER_01]: laborious practices and and okay you're
you're saving money on on a lot of inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: that a non-regenerative farm would be
buying in town but then but then you also
[SPEAKER_01]: have to buy materials to do other types of
projects there's like all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: trade-offs in both directions and so um so
for regenerative farming i think
[SPEAKER_01]: incorrectly is is assumed to be so much
more expensive to do because you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: to use the shortcuts of of modern farming
which is also happens to be poisoning
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody so i'd just like to hear um how
you how you kind of like weigh it out
[SPEAKER_01]: about the the economic impact um for you
specifically on regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding some of the other options that
you have in front of you yeah i i mean i
[SPEAKER_00]: think for the options i have in front of
me regenerative farming is by far the most
[SPEAKER_00]: economically feasible it's like when you
align your values and your goals with what
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally wants to happen anyway you are
not needing the products and the the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical energy to fight against the flow
um on a larger scale yeah industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: farming benefits from economies of scale
and that's something that's that's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: do on our level of regenerative farming i
know there is regenerative farming at
[SPEAKER_00]: scale um that that does take advantage of
some of those economies of scale but i
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have an economy of scale in our
type of farm even if i were to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: poison on everything and rode a till the
crap out of it um you know and when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to it it's like it has to work
economically if you're doing it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: business otherwise it doesn't work um but
it also has to work you know you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay me enough money to spray poison on my
land i live here um so it even if that
[SPEAKER_00]: worked economically it wouldn't work so
you have to draw your boundaries somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and luckily with with regenerative no-till
farming it it does work it is less work to
[SPEAKER_00]: not till it is less work to not spray
poison sometimes you do lose crops to to
[SPEAKER_00]: pests um as as one of my great um farming
mentor friends casey o'neill from happy
[SPEAKER_00]: day says when when you're selling products
to to customers and your kale has a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in it it's like the kale is delicious
and the hole doesn't taste like anything
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like it you get the products you get
because of the way you farm and they it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a benefit it it really is a benefit
economically so um i know that i'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of a bubble that that i'm probably
in with you because the people that i roll
[SPEAKER_01]: with uh literally roll with um we're all
into regeneratively grown outdoor flower
[SPEAKER_01]: right that's what we smoke and um and
we're not gonna we don't we're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: spend our our our money um uh buying uh
you know a plus b flower from a dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're certainly not gonna grow you
know salt sodium flowers we're gonna do it
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneratively and outdoors um that said
we are in a bubble right and there there
[SPEAKER_01]: is a market as as a whole and so um i'm
curious to know um have you seen an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in demand for your regeneratively
produced cannabis because you know as
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody in journalism i'm certainly
helping you know raise the profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative and all of us who are in
regenerative smoke regenerative but um i
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm not familiar with like how much of the
market is being purchased regenerative and
[SPEAKER_01]: there you are on the front line so are you
seeing an increased demand for your uh
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of cannabis flower yeah yeah
absolutely we are um and it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement thing it it's having direct
contact as much with with bud tenders as
[SPEAKER_00]: with customers and our brand which we
share with a number of other regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers is is farm cut and what we've
noticed with that is the product we're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to customers with sometimes is a
hard sell we're selling top shell flower
[SPEAKER_00]: minimally processed so basically untrimmed
to it and uh in quarter ounce amounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: it the the hardest part is actually
getting customers to try it the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: because nearly across the board customers
that try it come back for more because
[SPEAKER_00]: objectively there is a difference in the
experience from it so um the the challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: is definitely engaging with bud tenders
who often push indoor flower or brands
[SPEAKER_00]: they're familiar with whether out of habit
or out of market dynamics um but i i feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like we have seen an increase in people
seeking out regenerative flowers and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely an increase in the people who
do seek out regenerative flower coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back for our brand after they have an
experience with it yeah the proof really
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a pudding isn't it like after after
you smoke outdoor that was you know
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully grown regeneratively it really
it really does open up um what you think
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can be because of the wider
chirping profiles and you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: burliness in general well and the
challenge for us and why we created that
[SPEAKER_00]: brand is you you can grow the best
regenerative flower in the world and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't cure it right it's not great and
you can cure it perfectly and if it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: its way to market in a way that doesn't
preserve that and bring it to the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: in its best possible form then you also
lose that quality and we kind of created a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get it to the customer in the way
we enjoy it and it blows people's minds
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like when you when you open a jar
that's been vacuum sealed and and not
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed and you you break it open for the
first time and break a couple sugar leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it it's overwhelming like the smell
and then when you smoke properly cured
[SPEAKER_00]: properly stored flower the experience is
is just different and more full and more
[SPEAKER_00]: layered and nuanced than the experience
from some fast dried indoor um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there are two other aspects i want to um
economic regenerative aspects i want to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on um one you've already mentioned
which is the relationship with budtenders
[SPEAKER_01]: right um because it is interesting that um
you know budtenders do have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: control in uh influence and where they
drive people for their purchases so having
[SPEAKER_01]: a good relationship with budtenders is
important and in a lot of ways like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that friendship is also a
regenerative farming path practice in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way in that it's it's creating community
and outreach and and uh reaching out with
[SPEAKER_01]: um you know your philosophy of
regenerative growing and and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning is but but also and and where i
want to focus more is um the cooperation
[SPEAKER_01]: and community spirit that you um need to
have with other farmers on a basic level
[SPEAKER_01]: when you are trading resources like oh you
know i'll trade you i'll trade you hay for
[SPEAKER_01]: or manure or whatever the trades may be or
or sharing equipment those kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships become really essential in
regenerative farming when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: um you know you be very resourceful but
then also you you mentioned uh farm cut
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis um the brand that you've put
together with um you know looks like four
[SPEAKER_01]: different farms and yourselves where um
you know you you kind of get the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: of being a scaled farm without having to
do the the negatives of a scaled farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and that synergy only comes together
because you get together with these all
[SPEAKER_01]: small farms and then market and distribute
as one and we all know that that that was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that was attempted at the
beginning of of you know proposition 64
[SPEAKER_01]: days by outsiders where they're all we're
going to pull together all the small farms
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it ended up being a big crock um
but but but now in kind of like the dust
[SPEAKER_01]: of the brokenness of of the cannabis uh
system in in california we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers come together like really like
over the dinner table in in in a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: less grandiose way and it appears from the
outside uh that it's working so so maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: talk a little bit about this partnership
with um you know that you that you all are
[SPEAKER_00]: calling farm cut cannabis yeah so that
that partnership is is five farms
[SPEAKER_00]: including ourselves it's ourselves white
thorn valley farm happy day farm emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit botanicals in mendo and down home
farms in nevada city area and um it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful we're we're like-minded farmers
who came together we couldn't exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: create a co-op but we created a brand
together that we can share and like you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: said share resources share share the
burden of the tasks um joseph from emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit is our our our primary salesperson
and he uh because other members of his
[SPEAKER_00]: family are taking care of the farm he's
able to travel a lot and visit
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and and talk to people about
about farm cut and about our products and
[SPEAKER_00]: make those relationships and and we've
played to all of our strengths and been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to develop systems and processes that
that work for us whether it's sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment or pooling our resources to be
able to say uh we have packaging that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard mason jar and we could not find a
good childproof lid for a standard mason
[SPEAKER_00]: jar that didn't have plastic in it so we
were able to create one to to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: factory and say we want plant-based
childproof lid for for this size jar and
[SPEAKER_00]: and create that and buy pack in bulk and
things like that and it it's heartening
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's um in this economic system where
it's going towards integration with the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dog heat dog venture capitalist
capitalist world the the cooperation and
[SPEAKER_00]: the building something together gives us a
lot of hope and a lot of a good feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: especially doing it with people we just
like seeing and being around anyway that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah totally the doing business with
people that we actually like really makes
[SPEAKER_01]: all the difference in the world it's so
great you know it'd be really funny if
[SPEAKER_01]: this um if this uh new childproof cap for
mason jars that you all invented that that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that the patent for that actually
ends up becoming popular because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a really novel useful idea and
ends up making you all more more income
[SPEAKER_00]: than the cannabis itself you know there
was there was somebody already doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were we were getting those um and
they were great products they they were on
[SPEAKER_00]: the pricey side but the main thing that
that we wanted is something that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any plastic and the one we had
initially started with our brand is made
[SPEAKER_00]: with a flax fiber and a recycled plastic
and we wanted one that was entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: biological plant-based material and and
that's where we got into it and yeah who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what the long long term of that I'm
I'm just right now keeping my fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed that that California could be a
big enough market that we can we can sell
[SPEAKER_00]: a majority of our product through this
brand that is is a joy to to be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: and um we're not there yet but we're doing
really well excellent excellent well it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nice it's nice to see good people coming
together in a good union uh for for shared
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit yeah it feels great too I mean
it's it's we get such incredibly positive
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from from customers and
dispensaries about it that it even just
[SPEAKER_00]: that alone besides the business aspect
it's like um it's a good feeling to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the thing you put so much energy into
creating well and taking care of well is
[SPEAKER_00]: is received and acknowledged for being
what it is in the world and also
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically the the farms that you have
partnered with I know several of the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know like who who doesn't want to
be in partnership with regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers who are generally happy go lucky
people anyway you know I mean you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: probably know Casey the best and you know
great success all of it you know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: great success yeah so so let's finish off
with this question you know like we
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally designed this episode today
so that we could talk about your farm in
[SPEAKER_01]: detail but really as an example of what
can happen on everybody's farm who's
[SPEAKER_01]: listening right whether or not they're
transitioning from from petroleum farming
[SPEAKER_01]: or or if they're just coming to their
parcel and and I think we did a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: of that um but but really like the direct
advice really could be profound and
[SPEAKER_01]: inspirational so so let's finish with that
so what advice would you give to a farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: with a new parcel or who is transitioning
who is just starting out with regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: practices I think the best advice um would
be kind of if you've read the hitchhiker's
[SPEAKER_00]: guide to the galaxy the best advice in the
world is don't panic oh I thought you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say to bring a towel that's not a
bad idea no don't don't panic don't stress
[SPEAKER_00]: do what you can none of us are are on an
island there there's no such thing as a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete closed loop sustainability system
look at your farm do your best find find
[SPEAKER_00]: the resources that you have available and
adapt to them find the markets you have
[SPEAKER_00]: available and adapt to them don't be too
hard on yourself for the things that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work and and don't imagine that that we
can be pure or to keep that we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we dream as regenerative right
from the start I'm you introduced me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative farmer I'm not a regenerative
farmer I don't think anybody is a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative farmer I think all of us are
striving to align our farming with natural
[SPEAKER_00]: process and balancing that with the needs
of being a human on earth right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is available to us and what the the
constraints and the the the burdens that
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have to deal with so find that
balance don't get squeezed between your
[SPEAKER_00]: ideals and your reality make make your way
the path that that is best for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: then see where you can improve it towards
natural systems towards more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability and make some improvement
that is possible for you with each season
[SPEAKER_01]: and go in that direction beautiful well
Daniel thank you so much for sharing your
[SPEAKER_01]: your depth of experience and your passion
for farming and doing the right thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: and your vision for your you know your own
parcel and your own family your own life I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that you know through these words
but hopefully we've given some people some
[SPEAKER_01]: new ideas for things to do on their own
parcels and also you know just just put
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farming more into the realm
of the possible instead of the realm of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ideal so I know your time is valuable
