[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, this is an incredible set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so I come here,
I was warned three things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, make sure you have the right show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I look at is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannonball X-Bow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, don't go to the damn bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, don't have coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be in really great
shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about the sort of
little episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked how many people read this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't read this book,
go right out and buy it from Amazon or
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my second book, TV with Nutrious,
and now I have a third book, TV with
[SPEAKER_04]: Fungi, which of course means I have three
books.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a trilogy, and that now makes me Lord
of the Roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, guys, you're supposed to laugh a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, when I first started gardening,
years and years and years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: well before I started doing anything with
cannabis, maybe a year before cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was no, you know, there was aluminum
foil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of nowhere, aluminum foil,
even though I'm 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then plastic appeared out of
nowhere, and we started to eat plastic,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what margarine is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we played with plastic, and we had
brand new fertilizers that appeared out of
[SPEAKER_04]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of using, you know, horse manure,
we had this great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had people spraying food so we wouldn't
have blemishes on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They invented, you know, instant coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a small, better living through
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a television show, there were
only three stations, and one of the shows
[SPEAKER_04]: was Mr. Wizard, and he was on,
and he would talk about science,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he had his little community assistant
who was sponsored by General Electric and
[SPEAKER_04]: a better living through chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, some of us took that
chemistry way too far as we got older.
[SPEAKER_04]: But today, well, here's the other thing,
when I was a kid, you knew who was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow weed because the light was always
purple coming from the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the original purple haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you grew weed wherever you could grow
it where nobody else would find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you had to be really careful,
you know, in case your parents looked and
[SPEAKER_04]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you grew, you know, was mostly
sticks and stones and seeds, and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: not very good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you had a PhD in chemistry,
and you can do hydroponics, and it
[SPEAKER_04]: required a PhD in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to be able to do hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now today, we don't have a little foil in
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have instant popcorn,
a little foil, a little foil in our TV
[SPEAKER_04]: dinners.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our instant coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't use those powders.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have telephones we carry around.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have television sets in our telephones
and magazines and everything we ever want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just an incredible world,
but we still, you know, rely on chemistry
[SPEAKER_04]: very often when we're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And particularly if we're growing
commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have an overabundance of
reliance on chemistry in our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, gardeners, and
unfortunately, some cannabis gardeners in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you know, we spray stuff because we
have crops we want to save.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One part of medical marijuana allows for
spraying with chemistry, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's not moral and it's not
ethical.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be spraying something that you're
selling or giving away to family members
[SPEAKER_04]: or using yourself that has a chemical in
it that you know is not good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not moral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ethical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely not right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things are so obvious you don't
really need to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why am I saying it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're going to have big pharma and
you know who else coming down our butts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to be definitely
thinking a different way than we think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be able to distinguish
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: By being the clean green, you know,
not the big corporate terrorist stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our goals today are to, you know,
figure out how to grow some really amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis easily without using,
you know, chemicals and using the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: food web in order to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give the whole talk off of this
slide.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil food web involves plants taking
photosynthetic energy and using it not to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce the bud, not to produce the
terpenes, but to produce exudates that
[SPEAKER_04]: drip out of the root and they're trashed
white lobes that end up feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's sort of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show you how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all is based upon the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a bunch of plants sitting around
on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday afternoon, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them says, geez, I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, French.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them goes, wait, I want Japanese
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they produce the right kind of
exudates, which they drip out of their
[SPEAKER_03]: roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are their roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the roots of one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drips the exudate out and it produces in
order to be able to attract Japanese
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria so that they can have Japanese
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now these bacteria eat these exudates and
they in turn are eaten by nematodes and
[SPEAKER_04]: protozoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they poop out the excess and that
excess contains the Japanese food that
[SPEAKER_04]: goes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with the fungus down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it can be a Japanese bacteria or a
Japanese fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then if it wanted American food,
the plant would change the exudate itself
[SPEAKER_04]: to produce a different kind of molecule to
attract a different kind of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's self-controlled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it wants American food, well,
it just changes the exudate and it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: American food.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be thinking sweat when you
think about exudates because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: exudating right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sweat is attracting bacteria and
fungi and they're attracting nematodes and
[SPEAKER_04]: protozoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're covered with protozoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you disappeared right now, your shapes
would stay here because of all the
[SPEAKER_04]: protozoas that are on it, which sounds
like fun until you see some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures I can show you in a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular picture of exudates
happens to be a kind of exudate that's
[SPEAKER_04]: identical to white blood cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only do they go out and get food,
you know, track bacteria, but these guys
[SPEAKER_04]: go out and they lock up things that the
plant doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't want to take up, like arsenic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these exudates do some pretty amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course these bacteria and fungi,
they all contain antibiotics and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're doing all sorts of things
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fascinating, fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant's trying to get the largest and
the most diverse population it can because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what protects the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity, if stupid Donald Trump would
ever understand, is what protects us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's when we're all the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we turn into a growing more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, large diversity because,
let's face it, if we were all alligators
[SPEAKER_04]: in here and one of us was a chicken,
oh my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to have diversity because
that's what protects us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what gives the antibiotic mix,
keep populations in control, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, God help the Republicans if
they don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a teaspoon of good soil, there should
be 500 million to a trillion bacteria and
[SPEAKER_04]: archaea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now bacteria was what I had in the first
edition of the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second edition of the book had archaea
because I didn't know they existed in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first edition when that was written.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were only in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were only in geysers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they discovered they're in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they discovered that the dominant
organism in the second step of the
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen fixing, and you've never heard of
them because they were discovered in 1978.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't make the textbooks until 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the third branch of life,
archaea.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a different thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys go over the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: They eat sugars and they break down simple
to digest things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ends of long carbon molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they eat and they eat and they breed
and they breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take two bacteria, you put them in a
peakly dish, ideal conditions,
[SPEAKER_04]: six weeks later, the earth is covered with
20 feet of bacteria, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they form a slime in order to colonize
and to protect themselves and to
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this slime is very, very important to
what we do because the slime, think about
[SPEAKER_04]: brushing your teeth in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're brushing off bacterial slime.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all licking your teeth right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use a lot of energy to get that slime
off because it's really strong,
[SPEAKER_04]: full of bacteria talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And producing a pH above seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if your soils have bacterial dominance,
then they have a pH above seven and they
[SPEAKER_04]: have all of this slime which sticks to
little individual particles of soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: causes them to stick to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So soil structure and pH come from
bacterial slime.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where it starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that teaspoon of soil, you have 14
feet of invisible fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_04]: 14 feet, you can't see it, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those invisible fungal hyphae,
you know, they're exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like plant cells,
fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never study them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like plants only they don't
have that little chloroplasty kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing in there that can make chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weave through those bacterially
stuck together pieces of soil and make
[SPEAKER_04]: even bigger components of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not bricks, these things that
are getting stuck together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got pore spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get pore spaces that hold air where
the little guys can hide from the bigger
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it rains, they hold water.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is soil structure, bacteria and
fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these bacteria, they digest
extracellularly by dripping enzymes,
[SPEAKER_04]: acids out of their bodies, breaks down the
stuff and then they take it back in
[SPEAKER_04]: through their bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they dominate in the soil,
instead of having a pH above seven,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a pH below seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are unbelievably strong acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is a fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're breaking into some feldspar to get
some of the nutrient minerals out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go out, some of them,
and bring back nutrients for the plant in
[SPEAKER_04]: return for those etchities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them just decay stuff,
break things down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them actually attach essentially
to the plant and bring back stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bring back phosphorus and
nitrogen and zinc and copper and iron and
[SPEAKER_04]: calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have them, your plants
don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: 96% of all plants on Earth form an
association symbiotic with these fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis happens to be a very big
partnership former.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's how they work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got two seedlings sitting in the
sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them says, jeez, I really like a
little bit of baloney today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Baloney sandwich would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what does it do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it goes and mixes up the acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It exudates, because it's got to get the
right exudate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts the exudates out into the soil,
catches the right fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fungus reels it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fungus, one end of it,
goes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the entry point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about the other end?
[SPEAKER_04]: The other end goes out to find the
baloney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: And these days, it's so damn easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You let me do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes out and finds the baloney and
brings it back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the plant says, hey, no baloney,
no exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a perfect relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're both very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's in this bed is there it is with
the baloney sandwich, little seedling,
[SPEAKER_04]: very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It continues to nurture this relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant grows bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really cool is that it shares
mycorrhizal associations and nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: with things next to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've got two plants next to each
other, even if they're different kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, a marigold and a redwood tree,
they can share sometimes, not always,
[SPEAKER_04]: their nutrient mix, which is pretty
incredible when you think about what we do
[SPEAKER_04]: and how we do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have stuff in the shade,
stuff in the sun, and it's all the same
[SPEAKER_04]: height.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sharing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are seven different kinds of
mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two that are important to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only one that we care about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an endomycorrhizal, which means that
it's invisible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see it unless you stain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Endo means in, so it penetrates into the
root more than the ecto, which is the
[SPEAKER_04]: other kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what they look like when
they're inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So buy my third book and you can read all
about them as boring as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you need to understand is that what
you are forming is a mycorrhizae or a
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizae, mycorrhizae plural.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's forming it is a cell,
a root cell, and a mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you are not buying mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're selling a product that's
labeled mycorrhizae, you're labeled it
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're selling mycorrhizal fungi,
and mycorrhizae is the partnership between
[SPEAKER_04]: the fungi and the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: It forms when you put the mycorrhizal
fungi down.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, a little craziness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what the association cannabis
looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a vesicular, and it's arbuscular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's vesicular because it has these little
brown thing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little vesicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It contains liquids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the transfer takes place
between this little get and the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got these little tree-like
structures that are arbuscular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's called vesicular and arbuscular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: These arbuscular ones look like little
trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're inside the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't see them unless you stain them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here they are stained.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the problem in our thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know it's an endomycorrhizal
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be called mycorrhizal
phagocere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has 50 different names on all the
different labels that you pick up because
[SPEAKER_04]: they keep renaming the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, we've gotten to the point
where we know that DNA can be very
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from now on, it's called
rhizophagus interrocetes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you write down one thing,
other than remember to buy all the Lord of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Roots books as soon as this talk is
over, write down rhizophagus interrocetes
[SPEAKER_04]: because this is the stuff that makes your
cannabis grow well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want a terrific one,
just for fun, just to see some wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: pictures, Google, wow, mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see the kind that I've been
using lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the old names, bomas lossic,
bomas irregularis, rhizophagus
[SPEAKER_04]: irregularis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably two or three other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But rhizophagus interrocetes is the one
you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to see anything else on
the label and you're going after cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're wasting your time because this is
the only one that forms the partnership
[SPEAKER_04]: with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I made my point?
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You leave from the wow test that I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you don't get the sense of how
big that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you don't get a big sense of how
that is if you put it on a gigantic frying
[SPEAKER_04]: pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not a little frying pan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was wow is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turned out, unfortunately, a male plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait to get some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's a big, big, big
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put the stuff on the seeds because you
want to infect the plant right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeds, if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're buying clones, you put it on
right away as soon as you get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to touch the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a communication from the plant to
the mycorrhizal fungi that says,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've got to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't find it in compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to add it to your soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to put it not only on the
seeds, but in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mix it around so that as the roots grow,
it runs into more spores and you get more
[SPEAKER_04]: colonies of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about this stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It produces globulin or globulin,
depending on how you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where all of the carbon or most of
the carbon in the soil comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes from globulin produced by these
fungi, mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the stain looks green.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff provides rigidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes the fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_04]: It solidifies the filaments in the fungal
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that left picture I'm going to
have to get rid of given what happened to
[SPEAKER_04]: Al Franken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seals the gaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also pretty important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you use much less fertilizer when
you're using mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get much better root systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use much less water because those
vesicles, they hold water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in drought situations, they use that
water to feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: As people discovered in Illinois three or
four years ago when there was a gigantic
[SPEAKER_04]: drought, and those that didn't use
mycorrhizal fungi lost their crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: those that did had a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They provide protection for things like
nematodes for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, they're coated with,
because they're fungus, they're coated
[SPEAKER_04]: with chitin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to chew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about, would you rather have a
hamburger or a hamburger coated with a
[SPEAKER_04]: shrimp shell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you're going to take the
hamburger without the shrimp shell because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's easier to eat, easier to get through.
[SPEAKER_04]: This provides some protection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if you're a mycorrhizal
fungi, that white stuff is pretty hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: get through to get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got that slime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it creates a pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have their own rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is called a microsphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've got their own soil food
web.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're feeding all sorts of fork
individuals up and down the whole form of
[SPEAKER_04]: hyphae, which are doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, so again, fungus, slime, I mean,
bacteria, slime, pH, above 7, slime for
[SPEAKER_04]: fungus, below 7.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two different kinds of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's what's going on in your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got all this bacteria and fungi
being attracted by the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the dad bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being attracted by the eschidates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, in turn, attract the protozoa,
the edum, and the nematodes, the edum,
[SPEAKER_04]: and poop out the excess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant gets fed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, all of this poop, oddly enough,
turns out to be a form of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: ammonia.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it, always.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
they take that NH2 and NH4 and turn it
[SPEAKER_04]: into NH2 and NH3.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have bacterially-dominated soil,
you're going to have nitrogen-fixing
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to take that stuff and turn
it into nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fumbly-dominated is going to stay as
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have fumbly-dominated plants
that like fumbly-dominated soils,
[SPEAKER_04]: they need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other plants, they like nitrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the plants that like
bacterially-dominated soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Canvas likes bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacterially-dominated soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to use things that attract and
feed bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lasses and the nurs and the
guanos.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to use cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nitrogen-fixing, because that's really
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Helps the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This happens to be some stuff that you
would have fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have a little bit of fungal,
because you don't want to have just pure
[SPEAKER_04]: bacterial soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to have at least 5% fungal
to give some soil structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then I mentioned that they
recently discovered that these bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: they talk to each other using electricity
and this new stuff that people keep
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about called terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're communicating in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're like in that big tent
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pineapple terpene over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, here's a little Fusarium speaking
to an unidentified bacterium using terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: as their language.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got fertilizer bags.
OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacteria and the fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been attracted by the exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how simple this is?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're then eaten and sprayed by the
fertilizer spreaders, protozoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's take a look at the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an amoeba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody always said they saw one in
biology class, but nobody ever did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the protozoa that everybody
did study in biology, but everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: assumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You forgot, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paramecium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you study paramecium?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were absent that whole month.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one of these paramecium will eat
10,000 bacterium a day and then poop out
[SPEAKER_04]: the exits.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of food if you've got a lot
of these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got tremendous amount of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might want to think about a
protozoa tea to cycle the bacteria that
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got in your soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last picture was what they look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to press the button.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they look like an electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, tea gets easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just take straw or hay, coat it with
protozoa, put it into a bubbler,
[SPEAKER_04]: or just put it in a bucket of water,
stir it two or three times a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: After two or three days, you'll be able to
see the paramecium running.
[SPEAKER_04]: After 10 days in the soil, they're cycling
like mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you've got nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got 40 to 50 nematodes in that
teaspoon of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are only four or five bad nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of them are good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad ones have to form these little
things when they get inside the roots and
[SPEAKER_04]: your plants turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're differentiated by their mouth
parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one is one you probably think,
oh, I don't want that in my kitchen sink.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just a rubber spatula.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a drill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just waving water and bacteria
into the mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one you want to worry about a
little bit more because it sticks right
[SPEAKER_04]: into you and then sucks out all the
polyplasm in your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one attacks dogs and causes hookworm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So other than that, they're kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some of the beneficial ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can attack the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bring in a little bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bacteria start to grow inside the bad
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The eggs that they lay inside hatch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they eat the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, the bacteria has been eating
the bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets really ugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You end up with a dead bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: They leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they always make sure they take a
little bit of the bacteria with them so
[SPEAKER_04]: that they can repeat what they need to do
with the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it breathes, it opens up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wee!
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a lot of nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get the right ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's lots of them being studied
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's certainly something you want to
be thinking about using.
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of things in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see these things by making
something called a burlesque funnel,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is just basically a bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I didn't have how to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's in the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you gather these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are soil food web organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're taking those bound together
particles of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're moving between them,
creating tunnels as they run through this
[SPEAKER_04]: larval stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's throwing each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all so stubborn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these tunnels act as air spaces and
pore spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hiding places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it rains, the bad air is pushed
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And good air comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, soil structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about you or me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about what the soil food web is to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, dog eat dog grow down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things are getting eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're getting eaten again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pooped out and eaten and pooped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually ends up down in the
bacteria and the fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, if a plant's around and it
wants that kind of food, it goes into the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got all sorts of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you've got all these mites in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different kinds of mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to know the difference
between the orbited and the gannison mite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of them eats fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them eats plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you have ones that eat the
fungi, then you know you've got fungi in
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this stuff is in the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a rogue beetle running around
there, killing things and doing terrible
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's almost gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, you've got the bigger
things that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bears poop in the woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: That poop is part of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: That bear is an organism in the soil food
web.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry for repeating this to those
who've heard this talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my window in Anchorage,
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look carefully, not so carefully,
you'll see that the window is open.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see that there's just a screen
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bear is looking in through the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see a little crease in that
cushion there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where my head was.
[SPEAKER_04]: A nanosecond before my wife took the
picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in this heavy breathing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're watching porn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I woke up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know what you're going to see
outside a window in Anchorage,
[SPEAKER_04]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see a moose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they poop in the woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all part of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once, one spring, I happened to catch
a pair of camels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them a hold up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we do other things to the soil that
we have to be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things we were trained to do
in day one was rototill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rototill breaks up the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: It breaks up the fungal structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that's up here gets cut down
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The worms get cut in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't live.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get two worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get two halves of a dead worm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a terrible situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody rototills one time or
another, because it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: For guys, it's the motorcycle that your
wife will let you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The engine between your legs, finally,
she lets me have a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes two miles an hour,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so people rototill and break
up that wonderful soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, we do things like we spray
when we start having problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows what to spray, because
they're going to teach us this at school.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go and seek expert advice at lows or
true value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that conflict-based teenager at Home
Depot turns out to really know his
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we do things like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was obviously back in the 50s when
you were allowed to do things like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: both in terms of the picture as well as
the chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm convinced this woman probably died
about six months later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm freaking believable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you use these chemicals,
and you do this rototilling, and you break
[SPEAKER_04]: up the soil food web, or you kill things
in the soil food web, you end up with all
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your pH may not be where you want it,
because you don't have the right kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: dominance in your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The globulin isn't being produced,
because you don't have any mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That globulin puts in 37% of the carbon in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in human acids, not gold in the acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's globulin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like 11%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cheap, so you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No nitrogen fixation, because you've
killed off the nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant says, I don't need to produce
exudates, because I'm getting this stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't need them either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the plant alone, until it runs out
of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're there, and you go, holy shit,
the plant's dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you give it more food, more
chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an ever increasing need,
because you killed the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now you have to become the soil food
web.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means you have to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is supposed to be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is supposed to be easy money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the chemical companies are
telling us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I want to stop using these
chemicals to create these situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you end up with no partnerships,
dependency, and of course, then you start
[SPEAKER_04]: getting diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once these things start to go,
uh-oh, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You put the microbes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really easy to do.
You can use compost.
You can use compost teas.
You can use mulches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can use mycorrhizal fungi in the
right situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So compost has everything in it you ever
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy that Malibu compost that's over
here, and go into the Malibu garden to
[SPEAKER_04]: take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to end up with all the
nematodes, and all the protozoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the bacteria, and all the fungi
you ever need.
[SPEAKER_04]: No mycorrhizal fungi, because it's not in
the compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to add that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only there when the plant sends out
the signal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no plants in the compost,
so it's not sending out any signals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, compost, you've got to have somebody
to determine the pile for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: If your spouse isn't willing to do the
work, and you've got to know where your
[SPEAKER_04]: compost comes from if you're buying it,
and your inputs, where they come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they coated with good stuff,
or are they coated with chemicals?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like tetracycline, et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And compost teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, compost should be made accurately
dominated, and fumbly dominated,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on what you put into it,
how much green, how much brown is in the
[SPEAKER_04]: books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can talk to a doctor in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's right here in this area,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Harvard University with a compost
tea machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you talk to the United States
Department of Agriculture, they will tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you compost tea is all fraud.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cooperative Extension Service isn't
allowed to mention it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, they're not allowed to talk
about cannabis either, so what do they
[SPEAKER_04]: know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to say to the Cooperative
Extension Service, see this lady over
[SPEAKER_04]: here?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the president of Harvard
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their first compost tea machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have about 10 of them now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn their entire campus into a green
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: All over the world, their campuses are
organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything they have now, they compost,
including their exams.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's good enough for Harvard,
it's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you park your car in Harvard Yard,
you're parking your car in a compost tea
[SPEAKER_04]: yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you use compost tea, and you can make
fumbly dominated and bacterially
[SPEAKER_04]: dominated, and it is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's wonderful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have the time to make
compost tea, and there's lots of different
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of brewers, you can make your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make compost extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, incidentally, there are some brewers
here that are just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here, Synergy, and over here,
this is one of the biggest ones I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make an extract by just simply
taking compost and cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in the water for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you're not going to multiply
anything, but you're going to strip out
[SPEAKER_04]: those and you're going to fold them
together, and you're going to stack them
[SPEAKER_04]: together, and you're going to roll them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to multiply them,
but you're going to get water and energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's going to take 24 hours,
but you get good stuff out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great way to go as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green stuff is good for bacteria,
and brown stuff is good for fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The end game is to increase the microbial
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are two new things I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I spoke here last year, the first
one I'm going to talk about right now is
[SPEAKER_04]: called a microbiometer, and it measures
microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look it up at www.microbiometer
.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microbiomass, we want to increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing we're going to talk about
at the end of my talk here, and it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to amaze you as a new kind of life,
but microbes hold the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: they cycle the nutrients, they recycle the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have high microbial biomass,
all things considered, not soil full of
[SPEAKER_04]: poop, but if you have normal soil that
you're growing in, and you're adding good
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff to it, you test the microbial
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's over 500, it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's over 800, you don't have to feed
the soil anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can measure when the biomass
drops, when the plant stops producing
[SPEAKER_04]: action dates, right before it starts to
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know ahead of time that your plants
are about to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that might save you some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, biomass is very, very important,
and you want to have big, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got good biomass in your soil,
you've got the best opportunity to have
[SPEAKER_04]: nutritious plants, good terpene in your
plants, big plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't
have been a doctor today if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_04]: methyl methyl chicken wire, but there are
only 18 elements you have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in my second book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest is filler.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every time you think about putting
seaweed down, that seaweed ain't feeding
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got 56 different nutrients in it,
but only 18 of them are feeding that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only one the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, on the other hand, the seaweed is
feeding the microbes that feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that regard, very good and very
healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: 17, 18 elements, you can't play cards with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you do the combination,
it turns out that it's like 56 zillion,
[SPEAKER_04]: quadrillion different kinds of molecules
can be made by various combinations.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are only 14 new nutrients,
5% of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of it, 95% of what is in a
plant, water, oxygen, carbon, the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's that 5% you really want to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it only goes into the plant through
these little special channels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each channel designed for one kind of
molecule, each channel made by every
[SPEAKER_04]: individual cell themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each channel sometimes only used for two
or three molecules to come through,
[SPEAKER_04]: like boron.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need very many boron to form a
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only four, five, six, seven,
eight molecules of boron.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made this whole structure just for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're feeding their plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the only things that really
count.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the ionic form of all the
nutrients and how they get into the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that go through those little things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the soil food web creates this
incredible biomass so that the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: are available all the time when the plant
needs it and needs a call on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all starts with those exudates that the
plant puts out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're feeding microbes when you're going
organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got to concentrate on those
microbes as much as possible, not the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the end game is the biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make sure you test your soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we know the rule is the least
amount that's missing is the one that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to screw you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got to know it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't guess by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think you know by looking at a
yellow leaf your plant needs nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 180 different reasons why your
plant needs yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happens to be nitrogen is the one
that's easy to take pictures of and write
[SPEAKER_04]: about as a garden product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Test your soil biologically, soil food
web, and other places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your own microbiometer test and get a
chemical test, too, because you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These cells are important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what goes on in these cells depend on
what's in that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are billions of these cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this little period right here,
there are 5 to 15 plant cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that little teeny period on a book,
not here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are small.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are really small, like small minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are lots of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are how many atoms are in an
individual plant cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how many atoms are in that plant
cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so each one of these atoms relies on
the stuff that you're giving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't ever think about these things
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produce all of the molecules that are
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside every single cell of the plant,
there are 1,000 different kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now remember, there's 200 gazillion of
atoms in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 1,000 different kinds of
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 of each one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just the enzymes alone in every
single cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable when they produce sugars like
freezing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So enough so that you can fill up a train
that would go around the Earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: A 30 million car train would go around the
Earth 120 times.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how much sugar is produced every
year by plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a staggering number.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that comes closer are those
K cups that people use for coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these enzymes are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they work best at 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why your plants work best at that
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to keep it at that temperature
if you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the growth occurs at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the temperature at night at 78
degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get maximum, beautiful
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this stuff is pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to react properly for what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you only can do this stuff if you test
and you know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't have to fake anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I have to throw this in here just
because I want to kick the screens is what
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil is key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to make sure it's clean and
pure and organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to smell nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That smell is from a substance being
produced by a streptococci, a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kind of stuff that we use in
medicines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called geosyn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have good soil and you have
a beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a condominium for the soil food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to have the very best soil
that you possibly can, a nice mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make it a beautiful
condominium, not a slow condominium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a worker condominium.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to make it a luxury condominium
for the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to fill it up with the right
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be able to take care of
the pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to keep them under control
biologically.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can, you want to add the right
organs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be thinking about
consumption, out competition,
[SPEAKER_04]: interference, and reduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you've got to think like a soil food
buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the questions you have to
ask yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you ask yourself these questions
because if you can answer them,
[SPEAKER_04]: you won't have problems anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're not that easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They require a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you need to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got competition coming down the road
that we cannot believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't think they're going to go
and get those people from Harvard who are
[SPEAKER_04]: using that compost tea for their,
you know, for Bayer or Monsanto and
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else, you're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've got to be at the top of this
stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have to know what works for
aphids when we have aphids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily a particularly bad
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, thrips.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to know that vanilla might
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a little vanilla trap,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be clever about how we do this stuff and
use the right mites for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it's the same little puppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be a good little business to sell
these, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have to use the right kinds
of stuff for each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to pay consultants sometimes
to come and teach us how to do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we have a bad infestation,
we have to bring them in so that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: tell us what we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be using cover crops to add to
the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too many of us are throwing our soil away
after each grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, you spend all that time making
good soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the plant puts in the extra dates
that you want to have for growing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, even male plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do we do?
[SPEAKER_04]: We throw it out of the garden.
No!
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant it in again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even compost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just plant it in again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking care of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're testing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you want to compost it,
you can certainly compost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, I love growing female plants
in my male plant pots where I just top off
[SPEAKER_04]: because the roots will go down the old
root systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can grow faster, better, with less
energy and less nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, this is the way to go.
Anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you want to do is do things properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got to bring in an outside
consultant to do it, do it!
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys live a little down there in the
root systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they see something to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so desperate down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go, oh, I hate general hydroponic
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me some good wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he eats it right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you want to use the soil food
plant for your advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you're not going to just
pick it up in today's lecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need anything that's ever speaking
to you, you might, God, break your leg.
[SPEAKER_04]: You come down here to hear her,
for God's sakes, and take notes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and film it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a choker compared to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, she is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to soak up as much of this stuff
as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rhizophan is just absolutely
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy called it wow for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: He discovered it, used it, he discovered
it himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other people discovered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he discovered that it was what made
the big pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he won the International Pumpkin
Contest two years in a row before he told
[SPEAKER_04]: all the people about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to use the right lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to be talking about lights
just for two minutes at the end here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have my friend Zinn and Kat
show you a new light called a plasma
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most efficient thing ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I'm excited about it is
because the sun is the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organics and sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: What goes together better?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just the way it's supposed to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the LEDs, they don't quite cut it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the HIDs, we know they don't cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This new plasma lighting, you've never
seen a plasma light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're about to see one today in about
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you want to use the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to pay particular attention to
what your stuff does to the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you use a light, is that light
helping your bugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be actually helping the bugs
breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might actually be killing off power and
mobility.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have lights to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a synergistic effect of all of
this stuff together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to stop looking at it as,
oh, I'm just going to go get IPM.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you use IPM with the wrong kind of
lights, it's not going to work right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it with the right lights enhances it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a whole big different thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's more and more of this stuff on
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take pictures when you're stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this stuff is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, and what fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what fun to use bugs to watch a
praying mantis, you know, bring your kids
[SPEAKER_04]: in and get them hooked on what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, man, man, man, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the paramecium tea, you know,
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought you could sell little bags
of straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get away with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cover it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was definitely going to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to build that microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to measure it with a
microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to use compost wherever you
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to use compost tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to use the right mulches.
[SPEAKER_04]: So brown mulches are for fungal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green mulches are for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use green mulches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get your grass cookings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go around your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you take down that male plant,
if you're not going to use the leaves for
[SPEAKER_04]: oil, my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use it right there on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gee, willikers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, reuse them and recycle those
extra days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those extra, that plant spends 50% to 60%
of its photosynthetic energy producing
[SPEAKER_04]: those extra days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't throw it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and test it.
Test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me say it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most, I'm not going to ask because the
last time I did it, I was so, I was so
[SPEAKER_04]: pillored by people afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were embarrassed because nobody
raised their hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people here test?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the biofiber test incident on
the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a food web test.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you've got to test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because information's power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Information is power.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're stupid if you don't get that
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So information is power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, that's a nice looking set of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice design here, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you can use the soil food web
indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil food web is not just for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants are plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter whether they're inside
or outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you know, we're getting to the
point where, I hate to say it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think indoor growing, you know,
with supplemental outdoor sunlights,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way people are going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bigger and bigger facilities, whether we
like it or not, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So lights like this, you know,
and soil food web like this make
[SPEAKER_04]: tremendous amounts of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you definitely want to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to use Google.
[SPEAKER_04]: Google is the Canada's grower's best
friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, Donald Trump is right in
one thing, occasionally there's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of fake news on Google, you know,
like flushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people hear flush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, keep your hands down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, flushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you read Google, and boy,
all it says is flush, flush, flush,
[SPEAKER_04]: flush, flush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Read my book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem to make any sense,
the flush, when you really understand what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens in that cell, and you see those
little channels where the nutrients go in
[SPEAKER_04]: and things come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How could it possibly work?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know, duck, duck, duck,
if you want to use Google because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: the big bad guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want information we can get anytime
anywhere we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're all carrying around a
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're out there in the field looking at
your plant and there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't wait until after dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look it up right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in a terrific world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you can bet the big guys are
all doing this in spades.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to stay a couple steps ahead of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, so I always say to people,
if you're not convinced, just think about
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those redwoods, the ones that
have been burned down, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have been growing 500 years,
600 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 750 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they get that big without any
miracle growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, without any roundup?
[SPEAKER_04]: They teamed with Michaels just like you
should because it's the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
