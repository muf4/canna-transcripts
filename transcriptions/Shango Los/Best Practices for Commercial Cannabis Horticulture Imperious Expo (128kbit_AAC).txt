[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we know that the room's going to
fill up a little more as people realize
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're late for the panel,
but we are going to start now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, welcome to the one o'clock panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be discussing best
practices for commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am your host for the panel, Shane Golos,
and I'm also host of the Shaping Fire
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoy listening to interviews with
the top minds in cannabis, I encourage you
[SPEAKER_04]: to grab one of my flyers for the podcast
at the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week I speak to a different cannabis
luminary, and they teach you all about
[SPEAKER_04]: their expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us first welcome our guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting on the far end, Brian Kenton from
Berger.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the middle, we've got Casey Rivera from
Yerba Buena.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right here next to me is Casey Hubbs
from Orenbro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give a warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, these are merely highlights of each
speaker's bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to google them or approach
them after the panel for more information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start next to me here with Casey
Hubbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey is the laboratory director,
head of research and development,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as the grow team lead for Orenbro
LLC, a large tier three cannabis producer
[SPEAKER_04]: processor in Moxie, Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a degree in herbal science as a
certified herbalist with knowledge in
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable farming, product development,
formulation, QAQC, standard operating
[SPEAKER_04]: procedures, and plant extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to Casey, is Casey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey Rivera is co-owner and lead
cultivator at Yerba Buena in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey has over 20 years of indoor,
outdoor, and greenhouse cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: experience with a heavy emphasis on
sustainable and green practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also designs commercial growing
facilities for other cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the far end is Brian Kenton,
graduated from, oh, I wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is the name of this university?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Guelph?
[SPEAKER_04]: Guelph.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the University of Guelph with an
honors science degree in environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: He majored in plant physiology with a
minor in plant production, plant
[SPEAKER_04]: pathology, and plant entomology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian has been a grower advisor at Berger
for over 10 years, working with clients to
[SPEAKER_04]: establish successful protocols and engage
in trials set up to the highest of
[SPEAKER_04]: standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a fantastic, qualified panel
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to chat for about 40
minutes and then take about 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 minutes of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll be complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start at the front and
the far end with a question for Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everyone else will have an
opportunity to weigh in their opinions as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Brian, what is a common error that can
be avoided when scaling up from a
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition-era size grow of, let's say,
about 100 blooming plants to a very large
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed commercial cannabis grow for
cannabis companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be an error, but it's more a
number understanding that basically you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not dealing with, say, several hundred
square feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I do work with facilities,
and I do most of my work in Canada as
[SPEAKER_05]: consultant in that, but I do work with
facilities that are in the 10 to 15 acre
[SPEAKER_05]: range.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the information or the practices
that you've utilized before, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: once we get into what I call a high-tech
or high-intensity range, it just amplifies
[SPEAKER_05]: itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use some of the similar practices
that you use in small production.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you have to understand that,
especially with the companies I'm working
[SPEAKER_05]: for, they're looking for very high yield
in the shortest period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Canada, the federal government
regulates all medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we also have to answer to the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my job basically is, again,
to then re-home the ideas of cultural
[SPEAKER_05]: practices that include very extensive
environmental practices, practices that
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to create the highest yield with
the best quality in a shorter period of
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on the casing of the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, when scaling up from a
prohibitionary row of around 100 plants to
[SPEAKER_04]: a large license row, what are the common
errors that you can see being avoided with
[SPEAKER_03]: a little forethought?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the biggest issues that I come
across and see quite frequently is
[SPEAKER_03]: improper planning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And planning starts at beginning with your
business development, understanding what
[SPEAKER_03]: type of cannabis motivation facility
you're trying to establish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you establishing a facility that is
going to produce as much as possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you establishing a facility that is
going for the highest quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you establishing a research facility?
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding what your motive is and
what your business practice is is
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely important first step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, you begin to plan your
next steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That planning can go many different ways
depending on what your business model is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So depending on whether you're going
indoors, outdoors, greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: so understanding and developing your
business model with really high strength
[SPEAKER_03]: at the beginning is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just kind of play on that a
little bit also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having proper procedures and processes in
order before you get going is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important because if you have issues and
problems at a, sorry about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you're trying to deal with
problems on a small scale, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to intensify and get larger when you
try and upscale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have your processes in order and
like you said next to me, kind of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: goal and good business practices and
knowing which direction your company's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go towards is a really good idea
because some companies focus mostly on
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, some focus on clones,
some will do concentrate, or the plethora
[SPEAKER_00]: and so if you know which direction you're
gonna go in and you have those processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will help you a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an interesting idea that if you
have a problem that is small and you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: small grow, when you scale it up,
your problems are likely going to scale up
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Casey Rivera, so commercial
monoculture crops of all kinds have pest
[SPEAKER_04]: issues because of its lack of biodiversity
and other predators.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the suggestion you have for
commercial growers to avoid losing whole
[SPEAKER_04]: crops to pests?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a difficult one for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cannabis plant is one of the most
diverse plants on the face of the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Varietals, grow habits, environments,
the lineages on where these plants come
[SPEAKER_03]: from are in numerous different areas with
numerous different environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing your strains, knowing what's
going into those strains is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one most important thing is
pest management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being proactive as opposed to reactive is
always the best approach to it and having
[SPEAKER_03]: a pest management program where you act
like you have pests even though you don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: take care of your plant health,
is gonna set you up for success in the
[SPEAKER_03]: long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned the monoculture crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that say,
I've got this variety, I can produce X
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of pounds per life, I'm gonna go
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if that one variety kind of
digresses genetically a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have nothing to back yourself up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So diversifying your genetics,
diversifying them in a way to where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding those genetics before you
put them into a population, before you're
[SPEAKER_03]: counting on them for production is really
key.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people go for it with 50
strains, with 100 strains, and they lose
[SPEAKER_03]: focus on what these strains are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes extremely hard at that point to
figure out what are my strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: benefiting from, or what am I hindering my
strains with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my opinion pest management starts at
the beginning and it's always something
[SPEAKER_03]: that you need to be reevaluating depending
on what strains you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 30 different strains at our
facility and each one of those strains we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to handle a little bit differently on
our management program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We primarily use predatorial insects as
our main mode of defense as well as other
[SPEAKER_03]: natural micro insecticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bacterias and what not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So learning how the responses of the
plants are to each of these methods is
[SPEAKER_03]: really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more data you collect, the better your
program's gonna become.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a clarifying question before we
move on Casey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you said that one of the good ideas is
to work as if you have a pest infestation
[SPEAKER_04]: now to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you describe your palette of
preventatives, you had both pesticide
[SPEAKER_04]: sprays but also beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that when you're talking
about planning ahead, you don't mean
[SPEAKER_04]: spraying when there aren't pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about more leaning on
beneficial insects because you really
[SPEAKER_04]: probably don't want to add chemicals until
they're necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be a correct interpretation?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I mentioned pesticides, a lot of
people get this idea of chemicals bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: A pesticide is just anything that combats
a pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a micro insecticide,
so using fungi as an insecticide,
[SPEAKER_03]: using bacteria, using calcium,
enriching your plants to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way the bugs don't want to attack
your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Casey, the same original question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What suggestion do you have for commercial
growers scaling pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so preventative maintenance is gonna
be your number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing, kind of having a protocol set up
prior to even having plants in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're indoor mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do do some outdoor cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have scrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hair nets, beard nets,
and just trying to implement those things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning and making it a habit
because it's really easy to get going and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's a lot harder to implement those
good practices on the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing that was hard for us in
the beginning when we were getting off the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground is that we were submerged right in
the middle of top fields and so getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what agricultural problems are
already close to your facility or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area is really important because you'll
know what to kind of expect and what
[SPEAKER_00]: exposures you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like Casey said,
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented preventative procedures also
like companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have outdoor grow,
you know, look into what companion plants
[SPEAKER_00]: mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have symbiotic relationships
with the plants themselves to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: grow healthier, fungi, different kinds of
bio management, and I think that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: start off that way you'll have a better
chance to combat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that idea of knowing your
neighborhood is really insightful because
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of us think that the neighborhood of
our growth ends either at the wall of the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse or the warehouse or at the
fence line, but that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I'm from in Washington on Bashon
Island, one of the problems that we run
[SPEAKER_04]: into a lot is an interior mold called
botrytis, which here in Arizona I bet you
[SPEAKER_04]: see a lot less of that since it's so
wonderfully dry and great growing
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, but up in the Pacific
Northwest we get botrytis a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, after speaking to some
expert botanists in the area about why we
[SPEAKER_04]: have such bad botrytis, and they're like,
well, yeah, sure, it's cold and you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: wet nights and misty, foggy mornings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, but really it's the wine
fields down in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, what, what, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they explain that to make late-bottled
vintage Rieslings in Oregon, they actually
[SPEAKER_04]: spray botrytis on the grapes so that the
grapes strip up faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that makes its way blowing up to
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being aware of what, what is in
your environment that could be adding X
[SPEAKER_04]: variables to your grow is very important,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so Casey on this end, we're going to
start with you on the next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and, and, and Casey Rivera already
touched on this a little bit, but we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go farther down this path.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many new growers start with a wide
variety of cultivars because they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow something for every taste in the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: While others focus on just a few cultivars
and focus on growing those effectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you balance that for yourself at a
commercial level between having enough
[SPEAKER_04]: variety for the market, but also not
having there be so much variety that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't tend to each specific cultivars
needs specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we have probably 30 to 40 strains
in our facility right now, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is probably a better approach for
like our, our market is having,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, five to seven flagships,
something that you can own in the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you're really, really,
really successful at growing that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to want to come back for is a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also having enough strains in
your back pocket that if you do lose
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity or your, your genetics
start to degrade over time and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have something that you're working with to
pull out and replace it or have time to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase those genetics by, you know,
cloning and making them stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's Casey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Casey hit the nail on the head
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you diversify your strain
database, the more you have to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that starts at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing what your lineage of your strains
are gives you a better indication on how
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to grow the problems that
you're going to see with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we do at Yerba Boyna is we
really are close to what the market needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously we don't just grow blue dreams
and OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really kind of, as well as we want to
shape the market with what we find is a
[SPEAKER_03]: good genetic and what we're breeding
ourselves, but also coming out with good
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and really solid varieties that
the market actually wants as well too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work really closely with all our
partners, our dispensaries, our extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: companies to find out what's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point we figure out how best
to grow a crop specifically for what that
[SPEAKER_03]: market is going to need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of ways we can shape the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a lot of ways that we
need to be listening to the market
[SPEAKER_03]: responding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to understand that that
response is a six month or a year out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to constantly be paying
attention to what your genetics are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: and where they're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we've done is we've
separated our genetics into three
[SPEAKER_03]: categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the A's, B's, and the C's.
[SPEAKER_03]: The A's are our strains that we can really
sell a lot of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are going to be naturally the
ones that we're going to fill our rooms
[SPEAKER_03]: most with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The B's are the ones that sort of sell,
but maybe are a little bit harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we'll plant those on in every other
room type of cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the C's are kind of more of our
research strains, the strains that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: really trying to work on and develop for
the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you obviously don't want to put your
C's and produce a hundred pounds of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to put those in a smaller area,
really prove those genetics first,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then bring those to market when
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, we basically can't throw in a
whole cornucopia of different strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do concentrate on a hybrid that is
going to give us more than anything a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal classification because the
government does regulate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are looking at the total percent THC
content.
[SPEAKER_05]: The CBD, CNB, we're looking there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking for strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the greenhouses, which you'll see is
you'll see maybe only two or three major
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically because it's dictated
by the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, we don't even have to spend,
except for BC, which can get away with a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of things, we don't have to spend
trees even yet because it's just about to
[SPEAKER_05]: be legalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of our strains are based on what
the medicinal industry is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: requesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can imagine how from a
business point of view in Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: the variety would be something that would
be missing because in the end,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can only please so many people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from the horticulture side,
I would think that'd be a real pleasant
[SPEAKER_04]: thing if your responsibility is to keep
these plants alive and you really only
[SPEAKER_04]: have two varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get into such intimate
relationship with them instead of 40
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that I can imagine that there would
be a lot of pleasure in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My work, like I am a plant physiologist,
so my work has always been is to basically
[SPEAKER_05]: look at, for instance, the climates,
the different strains, how do we unfold so
[SPEAKER_05]: many leaves in a short period of time to
get us into that, say, 68 to 70 day
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering period, even looking for now
strains that are going to go below the 68,
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 day work on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still, for me, it's always
great to read the periodic miracles on the
[SPEAKER_05]: different strains, on the blendings to see
where we're getting to, whether it be like
[SPEAKER_05]: an 80-20 Indica, Stiva, or vice versa,
that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes the world go round for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would stand on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, going to paying attention
to your genetics because that's extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you mass produce and clone up the
clone up the clone, we're evolving these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants so rapidly, more rapidly than most
other plant programs out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so paying attention to these
variables, that can cause a drift here,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes towards the positive,
and sometimes towards the negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So paying attention to those and what
might be causing those expressions to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out is really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Casey, Casey Rivera in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that you and I were
talking about yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So indoor growers in many municipalities
get fined or worse because they're unable
[SPEAKER_04]: to control the smell of blooming plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: What suggestions do you have for trying to
keep those smells indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: We convinced our neighbors to start a
stoned farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really tough one to do,
depending on your operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on if you're doing air
exchanges, how sealed your environments
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's numerous technologies that you can
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: We spoke with them yesterday about H202
plasma generators that basically change
[SPEAKER_03]: the structure of things in the air,
can mitigate odors, charcoal filtration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that we do within our rooms
is we watch our negative to positive
[SPEAKER_03]: pressures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's nothing leaving the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our rooms are pressurized to the point to
where things are staying within that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do really close monitoring of where
that air goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're constantly moving around our
facility, checking our H-vacuums,
[SPEAKER_03]: checking any kind of exhaust units for
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our farm is in a rural zone, so the
complaining isn't too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's possible that one person does not
like the stunk smell for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really have to do everything that
you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes beyond the grow rooms as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your trimming, your production,
your dryer rooms, all those parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: facility are really things that you need
to think about in your odor mitigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the option of just setting
up facilities into urban areas or rural.
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically have to be set up as far as
away from any type of residential area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do use scrubbers and we do use
types of odor emitters, but it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: really a problem because we're so far out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like in Canada, if a pig farmer wants
to set up a new pig farm, he's not allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: to be within 100 miles of any area because
of the pig odor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess for us, it's best to find a pig
farm and then set up a new facility
[SPEAKER_05]: because then you can't differentiate
between the smell sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_05]: It burns your nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't have a lot of visitors coming
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're way out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add, know your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to go out there and make
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tell them ahead of time, hey,
this is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invite them over to see your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to your community officials and see
what they feel and how to go about it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're better prepared and you
can budget it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's several options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's charcoal filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the positive pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up the heavy filters,
which are really expensive and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: always help with odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's biofilters, too,
that they're doing some work on,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are not yet the go-to, but something
to definitely keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the idea of community
outreach and involvement cannot be
[SPEAKER_04]: understated as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, every one of us who owns and works
at a cannabis company is a representative
[SPEAKER_04]: of our industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to remember that for the past
60 years or so, we've all been demonized
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the unfortunate political
unpopularity of the plant that we all love
[SPEAKER_04]: so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they expect us to be sketchy,
unclean folks who are mean and not worth
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's how you tend to get so much of
this community pushback.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you show up at your neighbor's,
just like you welcome somebody in the
[SPEAKER_04]: neighborhood, you don't need to bring them
a pancake.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you show up there and you're smiling
and you're saying that you're here and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're glad to meet them and invite them
over for a tour so they can check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of openness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they see these are three very
friendly-looking humans here, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to tend to decrease their barrier to
deciding that you're nice folks and that
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't want to go call the local
councilman and talk trash about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we even take the time to have,
not on the facility, because we can't,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we will have a community night and we
talk about why we're actually growing
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really try to educate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to educate the community or just
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll start to see less abrasiveness
coming back to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the full understanding that this
just isn't going to work out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, we're affecting a medicinal
industry of all ages, of young children,
[SPEAKER_05]: of people, everyone that needs,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're starting to break a lot
into good media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for a lot of the magazines that are
really putting a lot of effort into that
[SPEAKER_05]: now to show that we're not there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are there for a purpose and we're there
for a good purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Brian said it exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue has been education.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all been educated one way for so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And devolving that lack of education,
in my opinion, is a step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a step-by-step process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's up to all of us to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone involved in this, I call this an
industry as well as I call it a community
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's up to all of us in this community
to reach out to our local legislatures,
[SPEAKER_03]: our law enforcement agencies, our utility
companies, as well as our neighbors to
[SPEAKER_03]: really help educate them on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this plant is doing for the world and
what we can be doing with this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, you know, if you want to
get a whole bunch of growers to kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, engage in really ruthless debate,
like at a house party or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can ask them one of two questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is, which is better,
indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: And just watch everybody go ape shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other one that is also fun for
pushing buttons is this next question that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to start with you,
Casey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, growers choose their
favorite substrate to grow in for a
[SPEAKER_04]: variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it all gets very specific when you
have to scale up to large-scale industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Casey, what is your preferred
substrate for commercial use and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we've been
tackling recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically a drain to waste indoor
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a little outdoor like we said
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, we were spending about
$120,000 a year on substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were using a lot of chelated
nutrients and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is that by switching to
a recycled organic living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to cut costs, reuse our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no till methods where you
basically just feed your pots a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, living material so you create
this perfect environment to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically just remove the plant and
put a new one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're cutting down on pH,
you know, testing, phing your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that it's at the sufficient
level for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're not messing with
dirty reservoirs that you have to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as far as cost efficiency is
concerned, that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to consider in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit of a touchy subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I read a couple articles I
want to share with you guys because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they're, it's really good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to write them down,
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just shout them out real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So High Times has a couple articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's called Seven Habits of Highly
Effective Pot Growers that I thought had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about using beneficials in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also another article on growing
for maximum flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a book called Teaming with
Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Teaming with Microbes book is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Brian, you want to kick us when you're
done?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have to go two ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the large industry, they look at just
a pea-like mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm supposed to be selling a
pea-per-like mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other half of me, it's like you
say, is coming up with a good organic mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would usually then, every year,
I would add a third new to that mix only
[SPEAKER_05]: to get the biomass working again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the biomass can get quite lazy
after a while and insulted out sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've done a flush and you
re-energize, because if it's totally
[SPEAKER_05]: organic, you do have to understand that
all your organic feeds need the biomass
[SPEAKER_05]: and the microbes to break them down into
an elemental source of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I always find still, if I have to look
at what I would do, I would do it that
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I have to work with large
greenhouses where they do use a
[SPEAKER_05]: pea-per-like.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will use mycorrhizae in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't use a lot of organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use inorganic salts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't have the choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The owners, the investors, who are saying
we want this yield, we want it this fast,
[SPEAKER_05]: in a short period of time, this is what
you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to work with both sides,
both sides of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Casey, before you go, I just want to point
out that you tucked in Brian's answer was
[SPEAKER_04]: a new, awesome grower disk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, you got lazy biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to keep that one around.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Casey, so what are your
thoughts on substrates?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, substrates is basically a tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on your business model,
depending on what your outcome is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can use any variety of substrates and
succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, we go with regenerative soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're an indoor farm as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some group houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do grow a little bit outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're indoors as well, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we use a regenerative soil approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with a local company that
builds our soils based off of the
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations that I give.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the blends that I give, they
regenerate it for us, recompose it,
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've developed a really good program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could do this in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, we don't have the time or
space in our facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we outsource that to a local company
that we work directly with on each of our
[SPEAKER_03]: blends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't just have one bloom blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't just have one vegetative blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes into learning your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each specific variety likes a little bit
different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you could supplement that with a
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could supplement that with a foliar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But giving your plants that beneficial
right off the bat in that root system is a
[SPEAKER_03]: great approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the terms that I hear a lot is a
drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people feel like the soil is
that, OK, well, you're running off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, honestly, if you're optimizing your
facility, then you're not wasting any
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've kind of redeveloped that term
into is a feed to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that we do is we pay close
attention to how that plant is reacting to
[SPEAKER_03]: how much water we're feeding it and how
much nutrients we're applying to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, we're able to adjust
our scheduling as well as our partner
[SPEAKER_03]: planting to feed everything optimally so
we don't have any drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is zero water that comes out of our
facility that is not used by the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are benefits to using other types of
growing methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use aeroponics in all of our cloning
just because that's what our schedule
[SPEAKER_03]: allows best for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It saves a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It saves a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're doing it right, you can
produce a really healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting in the vegetative mode and all of
our mothers, our research, and our blooms,
[SPEAKER_03]: we use the regenerative soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And paying attention to your soil is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we do is we get our leaf
surface or our leaf tested so we can see
[SPEAKER_03]: our biology going on our leaf,
our elements, our minerals going on the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also test our soil as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We test the soil when it comes in so we
can get a baseline on what our soil is
[SPEAKER_03]: looking like, not just mineral-wise,
but bacterial-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also test it at peak performance of
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if our plants are unhealthy as well,
too, we'll do soil tests because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really going to tell you what's going on
with that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a magnesium deficiency or am I
giving it too much calcium, locking out my
[SPEAKER_03]: magnesium?
[SPEAKER_03]: So paying attention to your soil,
paying attention to your foliage,
[SPEAKER_03]: paying attention to your plants is really
key.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep tying it back to the same thing,
but it really goes from start to finish
[SPEAKER_03]: and paying attention to your operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do it sustainably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use soil sustainably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use hydroponics sustainably.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it comes back to what kind of business
are you creating for yourselves?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one thing I had to add is I always
look at the percent duration in the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, we always sell oxygen short in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: But say if I have a mix that's too tight
and I can't get rid of the, or the system
[SPEAKER_05]: can't get rid of the excess free water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's filling all the large pores which
should only be filled with, after
[SPEAKER_05]: watering, oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have to understand how important
oxygen is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oxygen is, as a plant physiologist,
we call them O2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can get oxygen, if my mix can get rid
of all of its excess water in less than
[SPEAKER_05]: three hours and get oxygen back in there,
a lot of your minerals or elements are
[SPEAKER_05]: basically looking for an O2 to group into.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to move into the plant twice as fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a speed for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also too, I have to promote myself the
fact that if I get a lot of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a lot of root hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of the so-called stationary
that hold on and keep the plant tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want to be looking for all those
roots that keep on subdividing small
[SPEAKER_05]: roots, root hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: 95% of water and nutrient taken up by a
plant is taken up through those little
[SPEAKER_05]: root hair caps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by getting a lot of root hairs,
we increase the root surface area by 20 to
[SPEAKER_05]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning that so any time you put something
through there, whether it's just pH
[SPEAKER_05]: buffered water or nutrients and that,
you've created a root surface area so that
[SPEAKER_05]: your nutrients, you have much more
nutrients not going through as leaching,
[SPEAKER_05]: but going up into the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and with that is paying attention to
that, paying attention to the life in your
[SPEAKER_03]: soil that's actually feeding your plants
is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we creating a great environment for
our bacteria?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is our rhizosphere healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it active?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it producing for our plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it giving our plants the beneficials
that it needs to succeed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And paying attention to that oxygen is
what's keeping those bacteria alive and
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creating an anaerobic soil system is a
really tough thing and people get
[SPEAKER_03]: facillium wills, a lot of pathogens can
come out of that, how to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Casey, Casey Rivera, while you're on
the mic, I'm going to start this next
[SPEAKER_04]: question with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some growers build their entire grow
around the style of watering that they
[SPEAKER_04]: intend to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the solutions used in smaller
grows simply do not scale up to commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is a watering solution that you
believe is a good one for consideration by
[SPEAKER_04]: new cannabis producers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: At Yerba Buena we started out with,
we have a lot of new farmers on the team
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm an educator, I really like
teaching people, I don't just like telling
[SPEAKER_03]: people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them experiencing things on their
own in a safe zone so we don't lose the
[SPEAKER_03]: barn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started out hand watering everything
and in our facility we have over 7,000
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, so if you can imagine the time it
takes to hand water 7,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what that did is it educated all of
our farmers on what's the soil saturation
[SPEAKER_03]: rate, what is the plant doing,
paying attention to the plant while you're
[SPEAKER_03]: watering it, how much is going in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of connects you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are connected to us and the
more we connect ourselves with those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, the more we pay attention and
understand what they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently we've shifted into an automated
drip system, which right now we're on
[SPEAKER_03]: about version 3.5 because that's just how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no perfect plug-in play system,
everything kind of needs to get designed
[SPEAKER_03]: by your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've developed a drip system after
learning these metrics, after learning
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what our plants need by hand
watering them, we've been able to move
[SPEAKER_03]: that into our drip system and been very
successful at not only minimizing our time
[SPEAKER_03]: that it takes, the human hours that it
takes to water your system, but also
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively giving the plants exactly what
it needs every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't count to 30 seconds the same 30
seconds that Brian may count or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey may count.
[SPEAKER_03]: So telling someone, give me 20 seconds,
I may count 20 like a bartender or I may
[SPEAKER_03]: count 20 as a 1,000, 2, 1,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having a system to where it's exactly
the same every time and then understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: what your plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they up taking it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they not up taking it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I need to water every other day?
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing that can really help dial in
and optimize your watering systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree 100% on that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several thousand plants at our
facility also and we started out hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, half of our facility is still
hand watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have implemented some drip irrigation
in new rooms that we've built recently and
[SPEAKER_00]: having the background on the hand watering
and getting to know your plants at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point has very much helped us dial in our
drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Brian, how do you water in Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: Through drip irrigation, but I give one of
the facilities 10 acres, 15 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go very high tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done, as a plant biologist,
I do do that whole transpiration protocols
[SPEAKER_05]: and data and for variety and strain
because we all know that the leaf mass is
[SPEAKER_05]: different for all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then through computers, we put it
through a pulse system and I know a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that's only three weeks old and then a
plant that's 60 days old, how many liters
[SPEAKER_05]: of water it's actually losing based on the
foot candle reading or the light reading
[SPEAKER_05]: of that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we just feed that back into a
pulse system and it pulses the water
[SPEAKER_05]: through liters and it pulses the water on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what we're trying to do is
basically reduce as much stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, plant stress does not show
up or if they tell you that, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant is wilting so it's under stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the plant stress usually with
any type of substrate shows up three to
[SPEAKER_05]: four days prior to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you might miss three or four days
of important watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're basically doing is trying to
meet the daily requirements.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you still got to be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have to go out there and once in
a while check the roots this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to lift that pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a hard time not doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when I was just a grower,
you were up there at six in the morning
[SPEAKER_05]: lifting every pot to say, do I water or
don't I water?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in those days, it was all hand
watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, a lot of the young growers that I
watch walk with, have you looked at the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the computer's doing that all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, turn the computer off,
go out there and learn how to be a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: smith.
[SPEAKER_05]: With any plant, whether it's with cannabis
or not, if you can be a root smith instead
[SPEAKER_05]: of a plant smith, because where do your
top part of the plant come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you say, if you maintain that ideal
for good rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got some time for a couple
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do I have any hands from someone who'd
like to ask them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, in Canada, if you're going
to reduce the amount of strains you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't that limit the turpentine
profiles available for patients?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not reducing the strains,
but we're always working on still
[SPEAKER_05]: developing the strains to what we still
medicinate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can classify and produce what the
industry's looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that we're never going to
eliminate strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just working with them to see what
gives us the best work we can do at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in Brian's case, and correct
me if I'm wrong, I think the way that the
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian system works is your customer is
not actually the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your customer is a pharmaceutical company
that's telling you what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so essentially, it's the
pharmaceutical company that's choosing the
[SPEAKER_04]: turpentine profile they're going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in the growers' hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the pharmaceutical asked me,
and I'm always at wit's end with the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical companies, because they're
not looking at the plant, at its
[SPEAKER_05]: potential, and what it should be going
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like they're just looking at one
entity of it, which is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to work if we, just like
you say, if we start getting in tunnel
[SPEAKER_05]: vision, we're going to be in big trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just turning out cannabinoids is
never a good solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that's what sells to the
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like half the pharmaceutical oral
medicines we take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 40 of them that do the same thing,
but they produce 200 side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're our people, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you test your soil and your leaves,
are you doing that in-house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing your own testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we send them to an analytical lab that
does agriculture testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on the state, there's
certain labs that can do it and certain
[SPEAKER_03]: labs that, if they're USDA-funded,
won't touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just reach out to the local labs and
see who's doing what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some labs might test tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some labs might test soil testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some labs might test soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some might do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually people that run the labs are,
for lack of a better term, like myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're pretty geeky.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they love talking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may be able to help you with
another lab or another lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in-house testing, I do not recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the turnaround time on a test?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Oregon, it kind of depends on the
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of agriculture in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's berry season, oh, you won't
even touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to touch it for at least
a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just depends on what's happening
with the rest of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until we develop cannabis-specific labs
that can encompass all these types of
[SPEAKER_03]: tests, we've got to rely on agriculture
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just add, when you are taking leaf
samples, make sure you're taking the right
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, we often refer to what we call
the most recently matured leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, someone might say, well,
I want to test that yellow leaf at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to test the one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to test the one that's actively
taking up all the nutrients at one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And soil samples, if you're using soil,
then they do one type of test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you switch over to, say,
a peat-like mint where there's no soil in
[SPEAKER_05]: it, it's always good to let the lab know
that, because then that is a totally
[SPEAKER_05]: different test.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, you were talking about the increase
in the density of repair endings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you get the most absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about biochar,
compost tea, or anything else that any of
[SPEAKER_02]: you would recommend for increasing that
growth of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fill in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, when we get to what I call lazy
soil, it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like biochar and other amendments
that are going to actually be symbiotic
[SPEAKER_05]: with the root system, they're always a
good addition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it is based on, you should know
your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your plants will tell you that that you
know what, I'm getting a little sluggish.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting a little grayish teal blue
instead of that vibrant green.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there is good benefits to those.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, all I can really say is that
totally, when you want to try these new
[SPEAKER_05]: products, there's enough information on
the internet to learn about these
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should totally understand that product
before you use it so that you're using it
[SPEAKER_05]: for the right purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes they cost a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we've been working with
recently is worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so worm castings are a really good
amendment because they have so much
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to hurt your plants
by applying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really apply too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vermicera is here, which is what we
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're good people to talk to if you
have any more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's actually a lot of different
companies right now emerging in the
[SPEAKER_03]: bacteria type of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people think feed, feed,
feed, when really we should kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: digress ourselves away from the feed
mentality and think about our biodiversity
[SPEAKER_03]: of our soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bokashi, certain bacterias that promote
phosphorus uptake instead of adding a PK
[SPEAKER_03]: booster in the middle of your peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different bacterias that are
responsible for doing different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Brian said, understanding what
that product does and when you should
[SPEAKER_03]: apply it and how you should apply it is
really important to maximize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to want to put a
phosphorus boosting bacteria on at the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you will, depending on how much stem
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on the strain that you
want to grow as well too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So learning those products, learning what
that bacteria does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Jeff Lowenfeld, he's produced
three different books now that are amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: books teeming with microbes, teeming with
fungi, and teeming with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredibly knowledgeable books on how to
use those and why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to finish up there Brian?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just the fact that getting back to
the make sure that your media is a media
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going to be well oxygenated after
drainage because all of these additives,
[SPEAKER_05]: they can get very lethargic and lazy if
your rhizosphere is not a healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're pouring a lot of money into
something and why is it working?
[SPEAKER_05]: It will work, but you still have to,
before you get to the get go of all these
[SPEAKER_05]: amendments, you have to be very confident
and healthy with the rhizosphere that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a fantastic collection and experience
that you shared today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much to Casey Hubbs,
Casey Rivero, and Brian Cannon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
