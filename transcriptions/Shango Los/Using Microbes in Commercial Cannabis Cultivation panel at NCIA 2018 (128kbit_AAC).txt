[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome everyone to the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this panel is using microbes in
cannabis cultivation, harnessing the power
[SPEAKER_00]: of nature to enhance crop productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Colin Bell, who is the co-founder
and chief growth officer at GrowthSentia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango Los, who is the host of Shaping
Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Nate Chevalier, founder of
Moon Time Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get officially started here,
I just want to let everyone know that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be doing a Q&A at the end of
the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabis Business Summit has an app
you can download.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the Cannabis Business Summit
Expo app from your app store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just tap the schedule in the menu once
it's downloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find this session.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just type in microbes and it will
come up right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the very bottom, you're going
to scroll down to the session Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can submit your questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also, as you're thinking about
things, as your brain juices are flowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if something pops up right away,
you can submit it at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we start the Q&A,
we'll try to get to as many questions as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate Chevalier, founder of Moon Time
Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Nate experienced the intensity of
kind bud for the first time, in Des
[SPEAKER_00]: Moines, Iowa, his world changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, he became aware of a new world
of herb that raised the bar for quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: While making ends meet after moving to San
Francisco, Nate was able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: connections that ultimately led him to
move to Humboldt County in 2006 on his
[SPEAKER_00]: path towards living off the land and
growing the best cannabis food and
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis culture inspired him.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a youth spent in a very conventional
agricultural setting, Nate quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized the contrast between food
produced for quantity rather than quality
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the simple rich flavor of food and
cannabis grown in an organic setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspired by his desire to learn how to
live on this raw piece of land,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate received a permaculture design
certification in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And continued his education at College of
the Redwoods, receiving a certificate in
[SPEAKER_00]: solar PV installation and solar thermal
installation in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: This education has guided him to leading a
sustainable living on his farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate is currently focused on implementing
more water-saving techniques, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: hugaculture mounds that build soil,
reducing plastic inputs, and foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals by preparing Korean natural
farming preparations, such as fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and fruit juices with local
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working on upgrading his rainwater
harvesting system to offset the demand on
[SPEAKER_00]: springs that feed the South Fork Eel
River, an important salmon-bearing river
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt County, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: His passion for growing the highest
quality product drives his effort to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in love with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: An amazing bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have Shingo Lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a lifelong cannabis enthusiast and
business strategist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the founder of Shaping Fire and host
of the popular Shaping Fire podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, he founded the Vashon Island
Marijuana Entrepreneurs Alliance to
[SPEAKER_00]: organize to island medicinal cannabis
producers and launch a media campaign to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the prestige of cannabis
producers in the community and educate
[SPEAKER_00]: patients about the proper use of cannabis
medicine to gain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time, Shingo has also provided
business insight and brand strategy to
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis companies, preparing to
make the transition to licensed adult
[SPEAKER_00]: market as soon as it became legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shingo continues to be a staunch advocate
of patient access, natural growing
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, sustainable business,
and heritage farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shingo is known internationally for his
extraordinary interviews with key cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: thought leaders and unique understanding
of cannabis businesses and strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shingo's YouTube channel of exclusive
cannabis presentations and technique
[SPEAKER_00]: videos serves over a quarter million
minutes per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now view these videos at YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check out the Shaping Fire
podcast at shapingfire.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have Colin Bell,
co-founder, co-inventor, and chief growth
[SPEAKER_00]: officer at Growth Sentia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a research scientist at Colorado State
University, Colin has published dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed publications that were
focused on elucidating microbial mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin left his academic position at the
Colorado State University in March of 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: to launch Growth Sentia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth Sentia is a young startup company
in the ag tech sector that develops
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial soil additives that sustainably
increase plant yield across many crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first product, mammoth pea,
is a beneficial bacteria bloom stimulant
[SPEAKER_00]: that targets phosphorous cycling to
maximize both quality and yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of producers across the country
are currently using reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmingly positive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pea is now being sold in over a
thousand stores worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin's academic research, including
long-term multidisciplinary studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which biological, chemical,
and physical characteristics of soil were
[SPEAKER_00]: measured to elucidate soil microbial and
plant response to climate variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: His more recent research efforts focused
on plant microbial relationships with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Riosphere zone to identify mechanisms that
may influence soil microbial taxonomic and
[SPEAKER_00]: functional differences among plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to earning his PhD, Colin worked at
C.H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robinson Worldwide Logistics as a regional
sales manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very exciting panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump right into the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a commercial growing operation,
conservation of resources, including time
[SPEAKER_00]: and money, is vital, changing from
traditional cannabis growing techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: consisting of bottled salt nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients to instead using holistic
growing techniques that bring soil alive
[SPEAKER_00]: can seem differently expensive in time,
training, and changes to operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Management often resists making the switch
because they're afraid of the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in doing something differently
when so much is on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And focusing on building thriving microbe
communities in commercial operations
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate be financially beneficial in
addition to just being more natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who feels like they would like to start to
answer that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I've been voted to go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I'm working with my clients to get
them into the transition, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got the farmers who have got this
interest to move towards living soils and
[SPEAKER_04]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's somebody else with the
purse strings whose job it is to judge and
[SPEAKER_04]: handle risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so very often what I'll see is that
the growers want to go very natural
[SPEAKER_04]: because they want to be producing top
shelf stuff with really wide terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles that look good in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you've got people who are holding
the purse strings that say, we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep the risk as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we want you to do it the way that
it's always been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the problem is that the way it's
always been done has generally been indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: or in renegade outdoor situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of the techniques that we've
done in the past with the risk assessment
[SPEAKER_04]: has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I tell them is that if you
want to make this transition and end up
[SPEAKER_04]: with a product that works really well,
that they will not stay on the shelf very
[SPEAKER_04]: long, will get you a nice price point,
and will also create customer loyalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way to go about it is to get your soil
up to up and going first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once the soil is alive and active,
you can use it again and again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now you're starting to save money,
and now you're putting less money into
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is how you move towards your
transition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to say that you're going to stop
your traditional bottle nutrients or hydro
[SPEAKER_04]: today, and then tomorrow suddenly be
probiotic, micro positive grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people who are saying that this is
too risky, they're probably right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I always recommend is that you
start building your soil on some extra
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of the property that you may have,
and get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start inoculating it with mycelium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start inoculating with micro communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start a separate pile for compost that
you're going to need in over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're a farm that's already
going, say that you are already 215,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now you want to up your game for an
adult rec market, start small by getting
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil going first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that way, when you make your
transition, your product, you won't
[SPEAKER_04]: experience a dip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of folks, when they make a
transition from bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: and not all bottled nutrients,
I'm talking about like salt nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: because Collins comes in a bottle too,
but it's alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the transition, you won't get this dip
as your soil gets beefy and full of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you've got is soil that's already
full of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you go to grow into it,
the product that you get off of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully on your first cycle,
will be as good or better as the bottled
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff you have done in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus the added advantage of all the
marketing win, because now you're
[SPEAKER_04]: providing a living product.
[SPEAKER_04]: A living soil, which as we all know,
connoisseurs are moving towards quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say as far as scaling a commercial
grow to a more regenerative practice from
[SPEAKER_02]: a typical, I guess, smart pot and till and
amend type of, application would be to
[SPEAKER_02]: start building the soil, like Shango says.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that we have found on a
smaller scale was sheet mulching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And building your soil with the compost
from your garden, with forest stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: with downed tree limbs or downed brush
from around the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing that stuff in, letting it
decompose, and you're building your
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found that scaling up Korean
natural farming is a challenge as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have started to go with the things
that are easiest and most, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: able to wrap your brain around as far as
when you're making your way through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It builds confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you want to start taking on new
challenges as far as your farming goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on top of building the soil with sheet
mulching, we also, on my farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been doing a lot of hugelkultur,
which is an amazing way to build your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, again, the downed trees and rotten
firewood, and you're bringing in mycelium
[SPEAKER_02]: from that, and you're bringing in all
kinds of stuff from the forest around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it from different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got different biology all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the main thing I can say as far
as starting your living soil to new places
[SPEAKER_02]: to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since, I want to add something too,
since I just interviewed Nate for my
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube channel, I think that he also said
that I thought was really great for my
[SPEAKER_04]: clients, is that he went through his P&L
and looked at his most expensive inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we're scaling for commercial,
it was one thing at $2.15, but now that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to serve as much of the
country as you can, those input prices are
[SPEAKER_04]: suddenly much higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he targeted those, and he's like,
OK, how can I make this out of using
[SPEAKER_04]: Korean natural farming techniques?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever I was trying to buy in the
bottle, how can I do that with simple,
[SPEAKER_04]: wildcrafted, or if you're a big operation,
you might not have time to set a team into
[SPEAKER_04]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can order things online that you
can then make your own at a fraction of
[SPEAKER_04]: the price using a Korean natural farming
fermenting techniques that other people
[SPEAKER_04]: just buy in the bottle.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the perspective that I bring to this
is thinking about, from a scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, understanding knowing it's a
fact that microbes and biology and these
[SPEAKER_01]: natural inputs are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably needed for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The movement that we tried to address as
scientists at the university was
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding after years, decades of
studies showing how chemical inputs are
[SPEAKER_01]: declining soil health, declining microbial
diversity in the soil, declining soil
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to sustain plant life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our goal was to figure out how to
scale, bridge that gap, and bring nature
[SPEAKER_01]: and natural processes back to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think of cannabis farming as
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing that requires a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all comes down to scale,
depending on the size of a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the biggest
challenges farming, cannabis farming in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, has these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to some huge farms just over the
last couple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we talk about is scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're using microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a couple of years ago,
this might have been different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with people all over the world in
the black market and in this market and
[SPEAKER_01]: through the Americas and Europe and
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's less known about the benefits of
microbes in some of the other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm writing articles and letting
people understand why you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you can plug microbes into these
agriculture management practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it is hydroponic, and the benefits
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this huge education gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get beyond that, it turns into a
scalability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a perfect world, we want to
mimic nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no plant in nature that can
survive without microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these natural nutrient cycling
processes of a full soil web and living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really difficult for some
facilities to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have multiple acre size greenhouses
and you're pushing out hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of plants and pots, it's not
really the structure that nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil thrives in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's about understanding
your limitations, understanding what you
[SPEAKER_01]: are capable of implementing, and scaling
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, it's a huge win for even
these larger or huge cannabis cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand, wow, microbes are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at the products and the
technology that plug in with efficacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness, meaning efficacy,
they work really, really well in the
[SPEAKER_01]: different soils and the different
environment they've created and
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually showing consistent
results, increased quality, increased
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to distinguish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to maximize our plant's phenotype
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot do that, in my opinion,
with just chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take the plant so much further if
we introduce some other additives,
[SPEAKER_01]: some other microbial interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not only inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also about workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also about space and all these
things that, at this larger scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: cost a ton of capital to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's really is a process of
where we are now, looking at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different verticals of benefits and
understanding over time how to plug them
[SPEAKER_01]: in at scale where we can be economic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of the big businesses I deal
with now, cannabis cultivation businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking at the full spectrum,
all the verticals of cost, the labor
[SPEAKER_01]: costs, the input costs, the output costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're measuring all those costs
along with the return, how much yield am I
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, how much quality am I getting,
is that quality and yield metric averaging
[SPEAKER_01]: out or worth all this other labor and all
these other inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I love to see the movement
going this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that it's a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with every decision we make,
there's trade-offs that we make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so incorporating what makes sense now
and having a vision of how we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: that better is, I think, how agriculture
moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's how this industry is moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving relatively fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll close on this topic by saying the use
of microbials and microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: bio-stimulants, the more formal term,
is the quickest growing agriculture input
[SPEAKER_01]: segment across every crop globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers across many, many different crops
have understood that they've quite
[SPEAKER_01]: literally hit a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways, some people term it
chemical fertilizers have failed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying that chemical fertilizers don't
work, saying that they've hit their
[SPEAKER_01]: limits, and they're looking for catalysts
and microbes and other natural solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow plants to continue to grow,
to maximize the yield, to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrients we put into the soil,
into the substrate, should be taken up by
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, some nutrients have
about a 30% efficiency, meaning we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of unused fertilizer that builds up
from year after year in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we think bio-stimulants and
biology is a solution to help balance that
[SPEAKER_01]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the market for flour is based
on bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many consider frosty flowers and
intense coloration to be the best result,
[SPEAKER_00]: or to be the result of intense synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can commercial scale growers do to
create frosty flowers with great bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal while also respecting the health of
substrate microbe communities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so something for bag appeal that we
do on our farm is we add microbes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do another microbe inoculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called OG bio-war.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's filled with all kinds of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also employ water-saving
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that making the plant a little
water-deprived actually makes it produce
[SPEAKER_02]: more terpenes and more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have gone to an irrigation system
that essentially gives the plant just as
[SPEAKER_02]: much water as it desires, no more and no
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding that the product that's
coming out of it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the stuff that we're getting
ready to take down after this light depth
[SPEAKER_02]: looks better than any of the stuff that
we've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily the biggest flowers,
but definitely the sexiest and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: the best tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the things I can
point to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have any other thing to add to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since I know that Paul is probably
going to talk about inputs too,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to go a different route
about this and say something that is
[SPEAKER_04]: generally unpopular with my clients when I
tell them it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, you know, especially when
you're talking to fanboys, people talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about the frosty nugs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And super frosty flowers are the sexiest
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're all white, they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is like being addicted to
steroids where the muscles, the bigger the
[SPEAKER_04]: muscles are better and that's just untrue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the market is going to
eventually become more educated over the
[SPEAKER_04]: next decade and realize that just because
of flowers is frosty does not make it
[SPEAKER_04]: ultra premium in what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will absolutely take something that is
less frosty, that has less trichomes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but has the powerful terpenes that come
from full spectrum sunshine and has been
[SPEAKER_04]: fed with an array of compost teas and
microbes and other living environments,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, soils and other substrates that
worms can actually live in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that the challenge with this,
of course, is that it takes more labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking with a guy a couple weeks
ago in Indo Expo out nearby here in San
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was talking to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's asking me for hints for his 40 acre
hydro greenhouse in Sacramento Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking to myself, like I'm not
the guy you want to be talking to because
[SPEAKER_04]: all I'm going to be telling you is tears,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the guy who's going to be saying
the things that you want to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm generally telling people other
than 40 acres, you know, bring back the
[SPEAKER_04]: one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, what I continue to tell
people is spend less money on your
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanical overhead and spend more money
on actual human staff who know how to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: and have them be near the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that is going to impact
the plants after you give it good inputs
[SPEAKER_04]: than the hand of the grower and being
attentive to it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though, you know, a lot of the
people when they're looking at their P&L,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're all like, we need to put in
watering systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still nothing like hand watering,
not only for the plant to get the right
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of water, but more importantly,
to put the grower in the proximity of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant more often to take care of it
regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an ancient Chinese proverb that
I'm probably going to poorly paraphrase.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, the best fertilizer for a plant
is the grower's shadow, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the grower's footsteps.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is one thing about scaling,
and, you know, this convention is clearly
[SPEAKER_04]: all about scaling, that I often recommend
to scale less, spend more money on your
[SPEAKER_04]: natural and human inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I count humans as an input.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is how you can start to make this
transition to a higher quality product
[SPEAKER_04]: that will fly off this shelves because
it's so great and bring people back for
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the question is not, would you buy
this product once?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, would you buy it again?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not a lot of stuff that I
would buy a second time that's not grown
[SPEAKER_04]: properly under the sun, in living soil,
in smaller batches with dedicated humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, I can't really relate
to the frosty bud comment as much as the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I travel all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with people all over the world that
are cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the U.S., there is that trichomy
frosty bud thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everywhere else in the world,
people are asking me about turkeys and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking to another grower just
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little south of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talked about this overall
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost relate it to maybe someone
outside of this industry to a meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have this experience that
sits with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a wonderful meal at a
restaurant, just as a side example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're coming back because it really did
it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get there, you see this plate of
food that you wanted, and it looks great,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it smells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these senses that you're getting
invoked by that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing this guy was
relating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about back in the 80s and
90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you know, I would try and check
all those boxes with my customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would get a bag for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look, and I'd see their eyes brighten
up and look at this flower and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: expect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would actually taste it and get
that nice experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they experience the results from
it consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, if I could take all the boxes
with that customer, I had it for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can really relate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has very little to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, even with THC, there's so much
THC that you could almost get now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about this full flavor, this full
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say these verticals are not any
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole management that you can
maximize.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to call the plant's phenotypic
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go into a dispensary to talk to my
friends, I don't look for the strongest
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for the flower that's nice and
smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes like it smells, and I can
have a nice experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THCs that are relevant to me,
I think there's so many different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those verticals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants determine by genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a genetics vertical that's
critical to get that plant a genotype or
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different phenotypes have different
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we breed phenotypes because
we want different characteristics in those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we breed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this whole climate variability
where we have to control the climate and
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing environment because that
strongly dictates the health and the
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's inputs, which I'm an input kind
more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That includes nutrients and microbes and
nourishing the plant to the best of its
[SPEAKER_01]: ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant can take up all the nutrients
it needs naturally, and that's through
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitation with biology and the
availability of nutrients or living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be able to maximize its
health, development, quality, and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this last vertical that
very few people talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was fascinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a facility yesterday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a big time deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They built a million dollar curing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They felt like that's where half of the
quality is getting lost, although back in
[SPEAKER_01]: after the harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see other people that are just
putting things in bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see it degrade almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not almost immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really an important part of
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it maintains not only the THC and the
CBD profiles, but the flavor in those
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you what, I can't say enough
about these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just obsessed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that we test with our
product, man with beads, a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: product, we're focused on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we can increase yield,
and a lot of great products do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can't bring quality with it or
exceed quality, I think we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: missing the main point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we really focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about maximizing the plant's
phenotypic potential for that flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: that full experience from the moment you
see it to experiencing it through smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: taste, and the ultimate feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big picture of how I think
about the quality of the plant and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can kind of tweak those different
verticals to maximize the genetics we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that, maximizing genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do see some questions rolling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not quite there yet, but I just
wanted to remind people, in case they came
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit later, that the Cannabis
Business Summit has an app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just download it from the App Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's downloaded,
you tap Schedule from the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find the session, type in micro,
and it will come up right away for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just scroll down and tap on the
session queue and then you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: submit your questions right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get them on my phone right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be asking as many of those as we
can in a moment here when we get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I actually, I totally agree that,
you know, in 10 years from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: blingy flowers, people won't be talking
about that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even going to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoor growing in native soils has
become increasingly popular due to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis normalizing meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a regenerative practice for tired
native soils that outdoor cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_00]: can use to rejuvenate local soils instead
of merely growing indoors in bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: or outdoors, in bags of shipped in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm just going to throw my
science card out here and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy soil and what that means to me as
a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to just talk about carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in carbon, quite frankly,
is the currency of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on Earth, we're all carbon based and
everything revolves around carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at healthy soil versus
non-healthy soil, and you can talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: it from a fertility perspective,
or a biodiversity perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see a very strong correlation
based on the amount of carbon that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cat on exchange capacity,
its ability to hold soil and hold
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, and it's all due to carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at that as a metric for
success or soil health, you can really
[SPEAKER_01]: dial in with a large degree of success,
how successful you're going to be in using
[SPEAKER_01]: soils to grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I'm bringing carbon up is because
you can add carbon simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to manage and turn a
degraded soil into a natural soil in a
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season, or in a year, or even in a
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils have evolved over decades and
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's natural, if you take pretty
extensive steps to build up the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get there a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys on the panel are experts at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to do that at my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And building soil, I'm pretty fascinated
by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're really trying to take steps
where you can manage and work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and take the right steps to build
that and make it healthier, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: simple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even, I call it carbon black.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the burnt carbon that
everyone's using right now just to create
[SPEAKER_01]: a cat on exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add all sorts of carbon to mix in
to help sustain soil health and start
[SPEAKER_01]: building that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to the carbon thing, with the Hugo
culture mounds, we have tried to sequester
[SPEAKER_02]: as much of the carbon on our property that
is just laying around as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the burnt jar, the bio jar is what
we're also using as well to increase our
[SPEAKER_02]: CEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel that while this year is very
challenging and we have a lot of wood
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath our Hugo mounds, that next year
as the rains hit in the fall and moving
[SPEAKER_02]: forward, that wood is going to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to break down into
beautiful, rich, black soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really excited about what the
future holds as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also are creating our own bio jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're burning some wood and putting it out
and doing the hardwoods and then adding it
[SPEAKER_02]: into our soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as those two things go,
I can definitely attest to that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing as far as building your living
soil goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the compost tea, just to get it
working and moving is the best thing I can
[SPEAKER_02]: suggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I'm going to take one
position and then I'm going to tell you
[SPEAKER_04]: why it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the position that you probably picked
up for the first time I answered was that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a probiotic person who believes in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you want to regenerate your
property, you are going to want to cover
[SPEAKER_04]: that sweetheart with compost teas,
grab yourself some cheap hemp seeds for
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber hemp and plant them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant some other companion plants,
not so much for pests necessarily,
[SPEAKER_04]: but other plants that are targeted for the
kind of soil that you have so they can
[SPEAKER_04]: start building up life and carbon and
nitrogen in the soil and take this
[SPEAKER_04]: neglected ground, make it alive again,
and then plant it your next season with
[SPEAKER_04]: your commercial crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is that I'm a probiotic guy,
but I also study business plans and I also
[SPEAKER_04]: give business advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're in California and none of you
have time to leave your property fallow
[SPEAKER_04]: for a year and let this happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my first suggestion to clients is don't
buy crappy property.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be in there ahead of time,
get soil tests, find out where the
[SPEAKER_04]: floodplain is, talk to the local farming
neighbors, find out why the people before
[SPEAKER_04]: you dumped the property.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get stuck with a bad piece of dirt
that you can't do your work on in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, with that said, your margins are so
tight and everything is so
[SPEAKER_04]: hypercompetitive in California,
while using these solutions totally work
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's where my heart is, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a permaculture guy at heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also don't want my clients to go out
of business because they have burnt an
[SPEAKER_04]: important season going through their
capital trying to regenerate the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know it's kind of a different
approach to the question, but my goal
[SPEAKER_04]: would be don't buy bad property to begin
with and do your homework up front and
[SPEAKER_04]: choose property that you can do your magic
on to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add, I think that there's a
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have goals and I think it's
absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to sit on a property for
a year or 10 years and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: in 10 years, this is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, I'm just going to dump money
into building up my soil and have no
[SPEAKER_01]: return.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not practical and it's not
realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a goal, this is what this
needs to look like, you can incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: and scale reasonable inputs to get your
soil built up better year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great examples where you
can get additive improvements through
[SPEAKER_01]: management, through extra plants,
through cover cropping, through getting
[SPEAKER_01]: leggings in the ground or clothes in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually fixing nitrogen and
delivering nitrogen through different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants right into the soil to enhance more
biodiversity, more carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes are carbon, just like the carbon
black, I call it carbon black,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different solutions that
are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about figuring out what's
practical, what's scalable, and what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: now solution so you can keep doing your
business, keep growing, and regenerate the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil the way you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if it's a five or 10 year goal,
don't expect to do it in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue to build towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are realistic ways to
accomplish everything we need,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is maintaining soil health and
maintaining our livelihood.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got another tweener idea, actually,
which is a good idea, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I look at things in too black
and white.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing you can do is you can
do your first season or two in bags or
[SPEAKER_04]: pots of some sort and be working on the
soil while you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have your rows of pots and you can
be hitting the ground with companion
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and with compost teas and different
types of ferments around the bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe in two or three years when
you're feeling that now the soil around
[SPEAKER_04]: the bags is great, now you can give up the
bags and go right into the soil and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: into where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be realistic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what challenges can a farmer trying to
employ regenerative practices expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: encounter?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biggest thing that we found is
trying to scale our labor away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional farming and going into the
more natural bringing in your own inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scaling up to our KNF, we decided that we
need about one gallon of each input that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're using currently a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have scaled up to our pickling
crocks rather than our little pint jars to
[SPEAKER_02]: make our ferments with local plants,
fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing lactic acid bacteria from a
goat farmer that's local to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get really cheap goat milk from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting these things to be ready when
we're ready for them has been a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what we're doing is each week we're
trying to make a new input.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sourcing the plants has been really
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that we found challenging on our
property was sourcing fruits for the
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had the berries and stuff around
the property is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've also had to go to just other
parts of the flowering plant and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: just take in the flower of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also started fermenting horse tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, horse tea is a really good one for
silica and for your powdery mildews and
[SPEAKER_02]: your diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also started doing thistles because
it's a very, very hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows very little resistance,
or I'm sorry, a very high resistance to
[SPEAKER_02]: pests, pathogens, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fermenting that, we're trying to pass
that into our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found really, really good results
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's making our plants take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the Hugo culture and the sheep
mulching goes, we have plenty of biomass
[SPEAKER_02]: around our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest problem is getting it to where
we need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live on a really steep incline and
getting it from one place to the other has
[SPEAKER_02]: been challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are a couple of things I can
think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I think Shango had mentioned
earlier, checking out the P&L,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had noticed that on our P&L,
one of the biggest things that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: going was earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were spending a ton of money every year
on earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to scale up our earthworms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to produce as much
earthworm castings as we use on a yearly
[SPEAKER_02]: basis, which is about six or seven yards
is what we found out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So scaling up to that has been
challenging, trying to find enough of the
[SPEAKER_02]: right material for the worms to eat and
create a really nice, rich earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: casting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The list goes on and on, to be completely
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are a couple of the big ones
that I can point to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm only going to hit on one,
because Nate's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the list of things that can go
wrong with probiotics is long.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the list of things that can go wrong
with hydro is long as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we are talking about is a craft here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you are better at one side of
the craft than the other, if you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro god and those are the things you
know, doing the transition going that way
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took me and put me in a hydro
environment, I would probably have a
[SPEAKER_04]: learning curve as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I would say the primary
challenge is education and experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all three of us are here to tell
you that these natural inputs will replace
[SPEAKER_04]: lines on your P&L that are costing you a
lot of money that you can replace with
[SPEAKER_04]: just a little bit of effort and a little
bit of wildcrafted or purchased nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you need to have the education to know
what they are and what the processes are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not hard, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But something that might just have a six
step process.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to know what those six steps are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when your upper management and your
investors are going like, hop to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't see anything going on yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, well, you know,
I'm getting educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pushing you to get it done now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, well, listen,
if we want to do this right, we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that we have the education.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because just like Nate's talking about
with the crocs, you can have a ferment
[SPEAKER_04]: going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of things that can go
wrong with a ferment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I made some of these
things, it took me two tries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they take a while to ferment,
you can make a mistake that only cost you
[SPEAKER_04]: like six bucks in inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it cost you two months in time,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the primary mistake or the primary
challenge, I think, is the question,
[SPEAKER_04]: would be education and experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that there's only really two
ways that you can get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, hire really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hire somebody who always already has
probiotics, KNF, living soils,
[SPEAKER_04]: building micro communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find somebody who already has that under
their belt so they can hit the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to tell you, there's not a lot
of those people at the professional level
[SPEAKER_04]: who can also scale out 5,000 plants or
whatever your number is, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of those folks that are
doing 50 plants or their basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: These folks are all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, finding those same people that
can scale up to the commercial size that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're needing to be able to make margins
in California, those people are very rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be prepared to pay them what they're
worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when the cat gets out of the bag,
how important this is, somebody else is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to want to steal them away from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the second solution is build that
education into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give your master grower some extra time to
do continuing education, just like any
[SPEAKER_04]: professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't expect every professional to
know everything every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we've got continuing education
for mental health care professionals and
[SPEAKER_04]: for lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So build in education time for the grower
and make them do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're going to want to please
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they may choose to skip their
education because they're feeling under a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make them do their continuing education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let them make some mistakes with their
ferments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And build in that into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let them take time to take their staff
and train them so that if staff people see
[SPEAKER_04]: something going wrong with a ferment or a
plant or whatever is going on,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can see something, say something,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that only works if your lowest person
on the chain knows what's going on,
[SPEAKER_04]: has been taught.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the top person in the chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So education and experience is clearly the
biggest challenge that I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of this stuff is old,
ancient tech that's being brought back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that anybody knows it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been indoors working under
artificial lights with artificial
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients for all these years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're swinging back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't just assume that it's going to be
done without challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's just what I continue to
comment on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scale is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example I was thinking of when I was
listening to these guys talk just now is
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a 62 acre hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have several 5,000 square foot
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 10,000 square foot greenhouse mostly for
high CPD hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do mostly agronomics, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want to understand plants and
phenos and genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And exactly what they're doing with the
different additives we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some high THC farms also for
research purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all agriculture research.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a research scientist, I would work with
a lot of different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to understand plant
microbe interactions if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we've got these licenses and
reinvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my growers, head grower,
he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a master's degree in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's really smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loves hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love using microbes in soil and
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our teammate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's on the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll tell me straight up,
I'm never going to do that for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not your guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is, there's this time-like
period where the way he's doing things is
[SPEAKER_01]: really efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can bust out a lot of productivity
the way he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the living soil way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a soil way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's such a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough people that know how it
works and understand the biology and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the interesting things like even
hydrology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's a difference in
hydrology between cocoa and living soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that watering regime is 100%
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to experiment with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with everything else, everything
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to run a business and
want to continue to produce on a cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, cycle, and introduce something that
drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it definitely takes the right
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes buying across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes that commitment probably from,
we'll talk from the money guys down,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, this is who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might not do this vertically across
the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to have a component.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And invest money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all big topics to buy into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about this last point,
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy to source inputs for 100
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy to source inputs for 1,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you're trying to knock out 100,000
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you have those channels and you can
bring those things in, ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: that scale is where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the growing pains and the scaling
between them is painful and super
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you're going to lose a
lot of the momentum from what's just
[SPEAKER_01]: called the business guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want to see that going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see all that cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a lag in any of the things
which you're going to see, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: educate not only internally and on the
practice and the biology, but you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: educate everyone in your company saying,
this is what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then productivity expectations if
we're transitioning this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buy in across the board is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easier with a home or a family
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard if you have a corporation and
you have a whole bunch of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: building out a large commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need visionary leaders at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, visionary leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have over a dozen questions in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to, there's some that
are kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to, I'm going to have
to just select them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you look for when comparing
between products with microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your opinion on products with many
microbes in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they out-compete with each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, my perspective,
if you think about nature, tens of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of microbes interact together,
both fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do this in a very beneficial way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the natural way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not necessarily a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think what I, what I think the
bigger challenge of using microbes is
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think a lot of people think of
microbes and beneficial, they use those
[SPEAKER_01]: terms, beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you know what microbes do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you understand the functional groups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we actually understand how many people
in the room understand what mycorrhizal or
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi are?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great audience for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know what they are, you know,
the functional group, then you know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply them in practice and you can use
them correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't understand how they're
functioning, you don't understand their
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's the biggest
disconnect overall communities of microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: live together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, tens of thousands of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You obviously have to have that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure there's no
antagonistic microbes, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my, in my, in my experience,
more rare than not, there's way more
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes, a thousand to one
beneficial microbes in nature than there
[SPEAKER_01]: are any pathogens or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbes like to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just part of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are different bacteria
groups do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are different saprophytic fungi
groups do?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand the microbe, understand the
microbial functional group, understand
[SPEAKER_01]: their limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you understand what these groups do,
you can use them with precision and
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole panel, we're understanding,
educating and supporting that movement
[SPEAKER_01]: through deploying microbes with confidence
and precision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not all microbes work in every
circumstance and not all functional groups
[SPEAKER_01]: are good for all plant health benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different microbes do different things
that benefit plants in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, again, comes down to an
education gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't buy a lot of products,
but my clients do.
[SPEAKER_04]: On my, my small patient grow at my home,
I just make everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make my compost teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make my KNF inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just make them and so I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people who rely on my opinion do spend
a lot of money on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell them two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, if you've got your eye on a
product that you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: want to buy, go to their website and
almost everybody has got a picture of
[SPEAKER_04]: their label, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get a very specific breakdown
of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go ahead and pour yourself a cocktail
or a smokeable and then Google every one
[SPEAKER_04]: of those inputs and learn what they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to make yourself a better
person at your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be way more interesting at
cocktail parties and you will know that
[SPEAKER_04]: product inside and out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you choose to buy it, you will know
why you're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus you'll notice that as you go through
a couple of these products in the same
[SPEAKER_04]: product category, you'll find that
different products have got something more
[SPEAKER_04]: than others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if something costs a little bit more,
you'll be like, oh, I see why it costs
[SPEAKER_04]: more because it's got this one product in
it that I know thanks to Wikipedia what it
[SPEAKER_04]: actually does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be short on your homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: And number two, if you are scaling at a
commercial size, the get past the
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing people at the, before you like
really commit to a product in your farm,
[SPEAKER_04]: call the company and ask to talk to their
colon, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And find out what the science is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to talk to you, especially if
they think that you're going to buy a ton
[SPEAKER_04]: of this every year forever, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're dying for your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So call them up and say, hey, I've got
this position at this company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are thinking about going into like 55
gallon barrel size of your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to have 20, 30 minutes of
your time to talk about it with the
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get them on the phone and you tell
them that and you say, pitch me the
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be so elated to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're done with your internet
research and after talking to that person,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will be able to buy that product or a
competitor's product with confidence
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that you're doing it the right
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the thing I could say mainly is that
more the better for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to employ as many as we can into
our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even at the highest concentration that
we can find, what I did find is trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: use multiple microbe lines is that there
was a lot of repetition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the number one thing to
be cautious of if you're going with
[SPEAKER_02]: different brands is just make sure that
you have a variety and you're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: with the same microbes over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are answering some of the
questions on here without me having to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really helpful.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does implementing a thriving soil
environment pose a threat to biosecurity
[SPEAKER_00]: of an indoor girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does implementing a thriving soil
environment pose a threat to biosecurity
[SPEAKER_00]: of an indoor girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to have healthy living
soils indoors, is there going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: threat to biosecurity?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I only would have one example for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is if you are making your compost
teas inside and they have got some sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: manure component.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you're making compost teas or
you're fermenting, you're essentially
[SPEAKER_04]: incubating, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're taking your source material and
you're giving it an environment so the
[SPEAKER_04]: life gets two times, three times,
100 times x, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli in there, suddenly your compost tea
is going to be very, very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm not a big fan of putting
manures in my compost teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will add that stuff separately,
something that has not been incubated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as I hear the question,
that would be the only thing that would
[SPEAKER_04]: jump for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can think of,
too, is indoors and making compost teas
[SPEAKER_02]: would just be the chlorine factor in your
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the number one thing I can think of
is just making sure that that's out of
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to hurt your biology more
than anything as far as I know indoors.
But
[SPEAKER_02]: we did stop using manures in our compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were for a while, or I was for a while,
10 years or so ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But learned of those risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to add to that, I think that's
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll reiterate what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most microbes are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some pathogens out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly associated with E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli material, the coliforms, E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to be careful of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're working with microbes,
especially in a compost tea, and I love
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas, the only criticism I would
have, this is an academic criticism,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little bit of an unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what's growing in those
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost always get good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you test them, it's going to be
different almost every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's variability with
seasonality, with the open environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing microbes for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't reliably make the same
compost tea every time, just if I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a closed, dedicated sterile system to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't do that now seeing them
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just a little uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think knowing or having consistency and
consistent inputs and defined inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: really mitigates that risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biosafety or the bio whatever,
that's not a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another person asked me once, a couple
people did, bacteria actually infect the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and go up into the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in some states, they're actually
bacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you count that you have to test for
the flower, that's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some of these states, you have to be
aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use concentrated microbial
products as folder applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially during bloom, maybe in veg,
no longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're engineering higher bacteria
on the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting your facility and your flower
at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you can deliver microbes in
the soil, where I think 99.999% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes do well, they interact with
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they've evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they've lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've evolved in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can get them in the soil,
you're going to have a thriving,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy environment that the plant will
respond to very positively.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes colonized the world,
bacteria in particular, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they created an environment for plants
to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have always lived in a microbial
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think is interesting is to
provide that in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a healthy, living microbial
community or living soil that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: can engage with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does show good results for the
health and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Nate and Shango and Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone, for coming today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
